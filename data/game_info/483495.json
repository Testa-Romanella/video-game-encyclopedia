That poor man. Do you feel any remorse for what you have done? If you do, go apologize to the superior.</p>\n<p>In \"thank you,\" your goal is to make things right. Venture your way through beautiful new areas in an uncorrupted world. The powers you learn will help you out...whether you like it or not. All you need to do is control yourself.</p><p>This game does have QWERTY and AZERTY support; you can press A or Q, and you can press Z or W, as needed.</p>\n<p>All areas are possible. If you suspect that an area is impossible, press S and D at the same time to skip the area. Be careful, though \u2014 you may regret this decision.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the game may lag or crash at times. I am very sorry if this happens, but I have no way to fix it. Simply have patience and keep playing, if you wish.</p>\n<p>There is a \"secret\" ending, which may be rather obvious to find. The secret ending is the bad ending.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff54477a8076d4405ce4c00af6e3518b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ali"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
