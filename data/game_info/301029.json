Coming into 7DRL, I wanted to make a twitchy roguelite where the rooms generated a corridor of weapons with different archetypes (and bonuses) that players could pick and choose. I think when we improve or succeed with the ingame items or strategies we\u2019ve personally chosen (eg: character classes, deckbuilding, Pok\u00e9mon teams) we feel engaged and validated in our work.</p>\n<p>My biggest challenge making this game was gameplay-related; I think the core is here but the precise action isn\u2019t accessible or as fun it could be. It\u2019s hard to intuitively get a sense of how your new items will land, and aiming/timing is very tricky. If I had a few more days I\u2019d likely refine this with more number tuning and more helpful visual effects. There isn\u2019t a lot of enemy variety either, apart from positioning or spacing, and that can be a bit dull after a while.\u00a0Still, there were moments when I died that I wanted to try again and learn from my mistakes, and I\u2019m proud that I was able to evoke that feeling at least\u00a0in myself.</p>\n<p>This is my second 3D game, and while it\u2019s rough in certain spots I\u2019m happy with the effort I put into polish. I hope to keep improving though! \ud83e\udd1e\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:24:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c4/4c41474b682e664609da983a9977ed43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daniel Savage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
