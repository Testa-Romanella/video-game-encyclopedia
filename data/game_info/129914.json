Critique is very appreciated!Read Postmortem--Synopsis--<p>A chill, very unfinished walking sim about an alien who visits Earth long after the human population has died out. This was my first entry into Ludum Dare with the theme Ancient Technology and unfortunately it didn't go all that well. Its unfinished primarily because I just lost interest in the idea near the last day. But honestly letting go of ideas, especially when they aren't inspiring you feels a bit liberating so I guess everything turned out quite well. This is my third game created for the game a week challenge and is not in a completed state.</p>--Known Issues--<p>-Game has no explicit ending or UI so exiting requires tabbing out of the application</p><p>-The movement is really bad and because of frequent camera changes, movement becomes not much fun</p>--Controls--<p>Movement: WASD</p><p>Run: Hold Shift while moving</p><p>Quit Qame: Alt + Tab and quit application on task bar</p>--Contact Me--<p>Email: nichoreynolds@gmail.com</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/NichReynolds<br/></p><p>Blog: https://touchmyhapticfeedback.wordpress.com</p>--Credits--<p>Third Person Controller</p><p>provided by Vinicius Marques</p><p>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/28647<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e35/e35b5a092063ca49d73695ff48c4e029.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NicholasReynolds"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
