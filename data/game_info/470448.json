The article the random number god blessed me with was \"How to Deal With Your Ex Boyfriend Who Happens to Be a Co Worker\". \u00a0The article recommends a \"reasonable\" and \"professional\" approach to the issue. But that would have made for a really boring game. So I decided to take another route: Get the asshole fired, so you don't have to look at him every day.</p>\n<p>I decided to go for an interactive 3d experience which focuses on a story rich experience where no overcomplicated game mechanics distract from... yes it's a walking simulator. But I hope you will like the characters I created. I would love to read some feedback on my writing. (And yes, I know Stanley calls the PC \"Cassie\" instead of \"Carrie\" - I noticed that mistake literally 2 minutes after the deadline).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Third party assets used:</strong></p>\n<p>Floor texture:<br/>from \"Yughues Free Fabric Materials\" from the Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>Funkorama by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/3788-funkorama<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p><strong>New things I tried for the first time during this game jam:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Painting textures in Blender</li><li>Creating a game which is all narrative and almost no game mechanics</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T03:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ef/6ef2ce85311e0ad5cb47d063b1f83a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhilippTheProgrammer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
