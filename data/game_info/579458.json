The moment you've prepared for your whole life. You've finally found the legendary sword Densetsuha, said to grant a heavenly path to whoever can free it from its pedestal. As you focus your magical powers and remove it, the ground begins to shake...\u00a0You'll need to use your new sword to defend yourself\u00a0if you want to survive this trip!</p>\n\n<p>Artorius was made using PICO-8 in just 1 week for Missouri S&amp;T's Spring Break Game Jam. All code, art, and music was made by me during the event. The music is a remix/adaptation of <em>Jack of all Trades</em>\u00a0by CaseJackal.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This was my fist time using PICO-8, and I have to say, I really enjoyed it!\u00a0Lua has some quirks that gave me a headache every now and then, but otherwise the system is really easy to use. It was fun building everything from the ground up, a much different process than I'd use in an engine like Godot which has built-in functionality for a lot of things. I almost ran into the token limit of PICO-8 right at the end of this project, and it's a bit of a miracle I was able to compress my code enough to fit it all in! Overall I had a good time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T08:54:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f25/f2552e69058ff8e17ec707c8da2dfdc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Athakaspen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
