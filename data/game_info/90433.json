The game takes inspiration from fast-paced top-down rogue-lites like <strong>Binding of Isaac</strong> and <strong>Nuclear Throne</strong>, and adds free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent gameplay elements of RPGs like <strong>Deus Ex</strong>.</p>\n<p>Rather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning, <strong>procedurally generated city</strong>, where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities.</p>\n<p>In order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.</p>\n<ul><li>Will you play as a soldier who shoots first and asks questions later?</li><li>A stealthy scientist who uses chloroform and tranquilizer darts to silently take down the opposition?</li><li>A genial bartender who can talk his way past the most intimidating of guards?</li><li>Or how about a hyper-intelligent gorilla, rescuing other caged gorillas to form a small mobilized gorilla army?</li></ul>\r\n\r\nThe Mighty Feature-List\r\n<ul><li><strong>Play the game YOUR way!</strong> Don't want to kill anybody? That's cool! Want to hack computers? Got ya covered!</li><li>Random world generation and TOTALLY EXTREME gameplay variety means you can play for <strong>600 hours</strong> and not get bored! Seriously though, go outside!!!</li><li><strong>Super-advanced artificial intelligence</strong> that won't put up with your crap!

Bartender, scientist, hacker, gorilla \u2014 hey, your job is probably in there too!</li><li>Stupidly huge number of items (in the final version)! Shrink rays, hypnotizing devices, boomboxes, <strong>bear traps</strong>, food processors..
