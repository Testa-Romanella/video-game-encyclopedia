The object is it move through axe trap using the digits of Pi as a guide. I\u00a0probably spent less then 20 hours on it and learned a bunch of new things about making a game in unity. I used all free assets from the store which are listed in the menu screen. Everything in the game, from the menu to the victory screen is done in Bolt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the start menu doesn't work it's because I still need to learn more about making a ui. You might need to adjust your screen resolution to be able to hit the play button.</p>\n<p>I must prepare for Game of Thrones so this is all I\u00a0have time for, I\u00a0hope you enjoy! Good luck</p>\n<p>(If my build doesn't work it's because I've never made a build before. Please let me know and i'll try to make a new one</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T03:01:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da2/da2c7d53dfeef590a88863bf1bf293ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrianJCummings"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
