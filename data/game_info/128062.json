Your only goal: Revenge.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>-Fast-paced combat<br/>-Simple and Fun<br/>-Random Weapon Mecanic</strong></p>\n<p>This game is a classic Hack &amp; Slash which rests on a simple mecanic: a dash. It is the core of his kit. He has at his disposition a variety of weapons (two for now) , each of these weapons have different area of effect. But there's a catch: everytime he attacks, he must kill at least one enemy, if not, he automatically switches weapon randomly. And if he waits too long during a combo he also automatically switches weapon randomly. \u00a0However, if the player succeed at achieving a combo of at least 10 successive attacks, he gains the possibility of triggering a super attack, a shockwave that destroys every enemies in a large area around him.</p>\n<p>This project was part of a school assignment, it is just a prototype and isn't representative of the final product.<br/>This project isn't likely to be finished as we'll have more school projects to do, nonetheless, we encourage you to try it out and give your feedback, any constructive criticism we'll be glad to take into account.<br/>With only 5 weeks and a team of 4 members, we did our best to make this game, so we hope you will have a blast playing it, we sure have enjoyed ourselves making it !</p>\n<p>Thank you and have fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Michael Meyer<br/>Ariiura Lemaire<br/>Teiki Guilloux<br/>Kusko</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e85/e85aa518d76b72c4a5c38d76deb019c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ecole Poly3D - Tahiti"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
