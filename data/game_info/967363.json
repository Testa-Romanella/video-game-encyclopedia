As long as you find a way to steal them.<br/>Know that a thief\u2019s trade is not a piece of cake. In order to get some practice, you\u2019ll start with petty theft. This is how you\u2019ll gain the experience required to access more and more risky \u2013 and most importantly, more profitable \u2013 jobs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gain levels and unlock new possibilities. Get useful tools. Together with newly acquired skills, they will pave the way to expensive items, which you can then sell on the black market. The tools of your trade include a crowbar and binoculars, as well as advanced equipment that becomes available as you progress, such as a laptop for hacking through security systems.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The creators of Thief Simulator 2 have prepared two unique locations with houses, banks, restaurants, and other special places that you\u2019ll get to strip of money, valuables, and other items. But before you do, examine the surroundings: find out when the building empties out, learn the tenants\u2019 or the employees\u2019 schedule. Then you just need to prepare a strategy and it\u2019s gone time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just be quick and efficient. You don\u2019t have much time, so you\u2019ll need to immediately assess which item to take and which one to leave. Can you handle the pressure, or will you panic?<br/><br/>Make sure to work on cars between robbing buildings. Start with small family sedans and make gradual steps towards mastery, which will allow you to steal the coolest sports cars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Remember to keep your eyes around your head. Even the best plan can fall apart, and the local police are just waiting for a chance to put you in handcuffs. Don\u2019t get caught.
