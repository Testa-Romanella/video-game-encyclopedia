For the theme, I decided to update the game and show what progress I've made as a game developer. Can you make it to the final boss and win? All assets were created by me. I don't plan on updating this specific version, but if you guys like the idea I may try to flesh it out into a proper sequel/game. I've also included the original Robobot for comparison.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Controls: W/S to move up and down, SPACE to shoot lasers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c4/9c46fd8153fbd3dcaa265850efb69654.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Curtis Lacey"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
