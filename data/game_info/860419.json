Under the Resolution and Presentation tab (in Player Settings too)\u00a0you'll probably want to set the template to Minimal to get rid of the bar and frame that Unity adds to its web exports by default.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, new Input System. I\u00a0really like the direction this thing is going, though I am a bit wary of using it on a production game. When it works, it's a <em>massive</em> improvement over the old Unity input system, and I'd say it falls somewhere in between Rewired and the old system in terms of robustness. It takes a lot of the ideas of Rewired (e.g. actions and maps) but puts them into a more Unity-native format.</p>\n<p>The biggest drawback with the New Input System though is that I think there's no good tutorials for it. Or at least, I\u00a0haven't seen any. All of the docs and tutorials tell you how to use the components Unity provides and I\u00a0think that's a\u00a0<em>big</em> mistake, because the Inspector-side (and even script-side)\u00a0connections it forces you to make are incredibly fragile and prone to breaking if you ever need to refactor something or rename anything.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have an example of how I would do input here, and it's what I\u00a0always reference, but I\u00a0think this example is a little over-complicated since that implementation was specific to Vector Fury. At some point I\u00a0think I should make a new example.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Requires a gamepad to fly the thing around.</p>\n<ul><li>Strafe Left/Right - Left thumbstick horizontal</li><li>Strafe Up/Down - Left thumbstick hertical</li><li>Forwards - Left thumbstick press, left bumper</li><li>Reverse - Right thumbstick press, right bumper</li><li>Roll Left/Right - Left/right triggers</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T16:33:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bc/4bc72dc5a6c79da0d9b4288d0dee4368.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Why485"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
