You\u2019ve just become the newest Master of the Machine, and now you must generate fear and expand your influence by playing Legend cards: those scary stories, urban myths, and conspiracy theories that lurk in the dark corners of the mind. <br/><br/>To clear a path for your Legends to grow, you\u2019ll dispatch your Agents to new locations on the map, harvest and manage resources, decide how to deal with events in the simulation, and spy on the operations of your foes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What are your deepest desires? Power, wealth, glory? Everything you\u2019ve ever dreamed of is within your reach, with The Fabulous Fear Machine.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><strong>Pick your poison.</strong> From cryptids like the Black Dog, to urban legends like Bloody Mary, to conspiracies like Reptilians\u2014with over 80 Legends to choose from, you\u2019ll craft a custom blend of terror for each city you visit.<br/><br/><strong>Horror evolved.</strong> Plant the seeds of fear in fertile ground. Watch and listen to how the media reacts to your Legends. Feed them, then see them grow more powerful and effective.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The job done right.</strong> Your strength is in strategizing; leave the dirty work to your Agents. Send them to explore new locations and infiltrate your enemies, making interesting choices along the way. <br/><br/><strong>An equal and opposite reaction.</strong> Rivals and the forces of good alike seek to undo the Machine\u2019s influence for their own ends. Plan accordingly, or you may find your own Legends twisted into inspirational stories, mascots, or other sugary-sweet clich\u00e9s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>A tale as old as time.</strong> You\u2019ll direct the stories of several Masters operating in different regions of the world. Along the way, explore the history of the Machine, its enemies, and the Agents who aid you.<br/><br/>Presented by AMC Games and SHUDDER. Early development of the game was supported by Red.es and FEDER (European Regional Development Fund).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-12T23:37:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/3999efe49d9eac11b6fedd14f7d67c3c.jpg", "website": "https://games.amc.com/game/fearmachine/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 47, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fictiorama Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AMC Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
