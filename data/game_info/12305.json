Get involved in trading and starting new businesses, or ignore it entirely.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Revolutionary Blight System Creates Realistic Quests \u2013</strong> A population of giant spiders can establish a nest near a town.  Townsfolk will go missing.  Over time, it escalates even to the point where the town falls under attack.  This affects NPCs, trade, and population unrest.  NPCs will be aware of the problem and request your help with it for varying rewards.  Don\u2019t act quickly enough? Watch out for AI heroes and rival mages accepting and completing quests too!</li></ul><br/><br/>Archmage Rises is being developed for PC and Mac and is set to launch in Q1 2017.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-19T16:41:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d7763d3a64d5d60cacde35ae2e7f09d4.jpg", "website": "http://www.archmagerises.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 535, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Defiance Game Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Defiance Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
