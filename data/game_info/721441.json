A dark one.\u00a0 You can walk (A,D), you can jump (W), but you can't see anything. It's hard for you to traverse through the cave. Suddenly you realize that you can see something when you walk. It's the sound waves that bounces off the ground. What is weirder, you can emit the sound wave (Space). You can see even more! Hm.. Maybe that's why you're called Echoman...</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>A,D - Move left/right<br/>W - Jump<br/>Space/Right Mouse Click - Emit soundwave</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Kenney.nl - 1bitplatformer pack</p>\n<p><strong>Source Code:<br/></strong>https://github.com/pstupka/GDKO2022</p>\n<p><strong>Made with Godot</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T05:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a2/7a224bdf625276974b2a3357dc4025da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["pstupka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
