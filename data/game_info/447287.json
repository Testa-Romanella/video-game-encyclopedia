Oh no, my friends, our fun is just beginning. The four suits you've dealt with are nothing. I have three more just waiting for you deeper down...\"</em></strong>\n<p>Hellish Descent is an expansion to the Old Scratch's own Scratch's Sc0re from 2019. Grab yourself three brand new suits of cards, More copies of both kinds of Jokers, cheat cards for each player that explain what the new symbols mean, and a\u00a0Legacy-style tutorial to help you get the most out of the deeper mechanics.<br/>Play with cards that can be any suit you need, as long as you follow the rules. Take another turn, but draw from the fiery depths instead of the top of the deck. Lean on a suit that could finish your hand quickly, but are costly to leave bare in you hand. Play \"Plain Blind\" or \"Get What's Comin' To Ya\" modes, or whip up a crazy variant of your own!</p>\n<p><strong><em>You'll need the base game to play this expansion.\u00a0</em><em>You can get it here.</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you'd want something nice, but money could be holding you back, Old Scratch wants to invite you to nab a community copy.</p>\n<p>Also, the Homebound Version is B&amp;W Printer friendly pdf.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T03:49:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f6/0f653e2512c18c473041a8ef65053d19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NinjaHELL!
