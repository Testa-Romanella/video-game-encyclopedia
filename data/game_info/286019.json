Following the theme of \"Gameboy\", Terra's bounty is a classic Harvest Moon type game. The graphics are made with a 4 shade green scale palette, and the controls have an 8 button scheme\u00a0to replicate the look and feel of the original Gameboy.\u00a0I also used a 160 x 144 resolution to match the original. Unfortunately I was a little ambitious for a first ever Game Jam entry and was unable to get all the features I wanted in, but learned a lot in the process.</p>\n<p><strong>Active Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Functioning Game Clock</li><li>Day/Night Cycle</li><li>Crop Planting System and Growth Stages</li><li>Farm Area &amp; Town Area</li><li>Choose Player Gender</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Missing Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Crop Picking/Inventory</li><li>Music</li><li>NPC Functionality</li><li>Farm Upgrade</li><li>Currency</li><li>Animals</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\"WSAD\"= Direction Movement</li><li>Left Arrow = Action Key 1 (\"A\") - Will Till The Field before planting Seeds</li><li>Right Arrow = Action Key 2 (\"B\") - Will Plant Selected Seeds</li><li>Up Arrow = \"Start\" Button (Unused)</li><li>Down Arrow = \"Select Button\" - Will Change Selected Seed Type</li></ul>\n<p>Seeds can only be planted while the player is on the farm field, and only after the soil has been tilled.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to leave comments, may continue refining the game based on feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e75/e75865183adb7d5acae7f78d147fbf4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thetallwizard"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
