As a part of a terraforming team, it was your job to find and prepare new worlds for colonization. While unleashing bio-mechanical horrors was not on your terraforming to-do list, saving the world will now have to be in your resume.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every encounter with the mecha-mutant fiends will be a swift and brutal affair. Luckily, you\u2019re an engineer and you\u2019ll have a lot of tools to solve such \u2018practical problems\u2019, from industrial drills and flamethrowers to conventional firearms and experimental weaponry.<br/><br/>And if that is not enough, there are always alternative modes. Need someone to cover your back? Change your minigun into a stationary sentry gun! Need some breathing room? Expel flammable gas from your flamethrower and set it aflame for a toasty, enemy-free space! <br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-25T18:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e960c838158f56191bc9033fda290bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 545, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mekworx"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hyperstrange"], "esrb_rating": null}
