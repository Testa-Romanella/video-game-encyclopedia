This  character-driven story is told through the five-act narrative structure,  two cutscenes, four levels and three locations in total.\r\n    </p>\n<p>The game was made for research purposes (of the final project) and  although this research considers all aspects of video games equally  important to deliver a true gaming experience, the game mainly focused  on the storytelling elements in video games. The final project aimed to  develop a new model to perceive the player-avatar-character relationship  in single-player role-playing games. After reviewing relevant game  literature and conducting a small-scale research study, the results  showed that the proposed measurement criteria can be used to measure  different psychological processes and game design elements responsible  for developing such relationships.\r\n    </p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<ul><li>Play as Artheus, a powerful warrior grieving the loss of his kingdom\r\n</li><li>Use the standard WASD movement to navigate through levels\r\n</li><li>Use the mouse to rotate the first-person camera\r\n</li><li>Use  the \u201cSpace\u201d key to jump, the \u201cShift\u201d key to sprint, the \u201cF\u201d key to pick  objects, the \u201cE\u201d key to drop them, the \u201cQ\u201d key to interact with objects  and push them away, and the \u201cM\u201d key to view the map\r\n</li><li>Adapt to new mechanics as each level has different obstacles and puzzles\r\n</li><li>The game offers a few choices that influence the ending\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T05:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae5/ae5ad4fa56ef33520ec50b83d0f8da7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nina Makes Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
