These characters correspond to the different teams,\u00a0<strong><em>Sugar and Spice</em></strong>. Deploying characters corresponding to your side gives them a bonus!</p>\n<p>The other attributes of each character are\u00a0<em>health</em>,\u00a0<em>cooldown</em>, shields (sometimes) and, most importantly, their\u00a0<strong><em>Affinities</em></strong>. These, based from previous<em>\u00a0Art Fight\u00a0</em>themes, determine each character\u2019s strengths and weaknesses! Most of them have some logic, but you can highlight a card or a character to see who they\u2019re strong or weak against.</p>\r\nItem Cards\r\n<p>Aside from <em>Character Cards</em>, there are also <strong><em>Item Cards</em></strong>, which provide extra utility and strategy to the game. These cards, which are single-use, can have various effects, which include healing a character of your own, damaging the opponent\u2019s, drawing more cards, changing <em>Affinities</em>, and even adding time to the timer!</p>\r\nBattle Flow and Mechanics\r\n<p>When you put your characters on the game, their\u00a0<em>Cooldown\u00a0</em>determines how often they can attack the opponent. Characters placed on the front prioritise attacking those in the back.<strong>\u00a0Those deployed to the sides will prioritise attacking their respective side. And, of course, those at the back will prioritise attacking the enemies at the front.</strong></p>\n<p>While Affinities have reasonable\u00a0<em>strengths and weaknesses</em>, you can hold the cursor over a card or character to see if they\u2019re good or bad against someone in particular. Remember that characters that belong to your own team,\u00a0<strong><em>Spice or Sugar<strong>,</strong>\u00a0</em></strong>get a minor bonus!<br/></p>\n<p>Some characters have special properties. Those with\u00a0<em>Healing\u00a0</em>will gain\u00a0<em>health\u00a0</em>after each successful attack, while those with\u00a0<em>Shields\u00a0</em>will block a limited number of attacks before losing health.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<em>Item Cards</em>\u00a0vary on effects. Some require you to target a character, while others can just be used on the screen to activate.</p>\r\nAim for a Highscore\r\n<p>You gain one point, or rather, <em>Attack</em> by the <em>Art Fight </em>lingo, by defeating enemies. The more you defeat, the higher your score! Defeating enemies gives you new cards, while defeating the whole wave adds time to the game. If you run out of time or run out of playable characters, it\u2019s <em>Game Over!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:25:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23e/23e70d5bf6bbafa0ce853eb25dc6a07f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whales And Games", "MoskiDraws"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
