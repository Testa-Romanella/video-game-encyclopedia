The theme was \"<genre> without <mechanic>\" and I made Tetris without clearing lines/a fail state.<br/></mechanic></genre></p>\n<p>I play Tetris sometimes to \"space\" out and relax and I took this opportunity to make a Tetris game that made for exactly that purpose. You can build your Tetris tower as high as you want (and discover some gimmicks I put in ;)). It even allows you to adjust the falling speed of the blocks to your liking or to stop time all together if you need time to think (you can still move and place the block while paused).<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Move Block = Arrow Keys</li><li>Drop Block = CTRL</li><li>Pause Time = Space (toggle), Shift (hold)</li><li>Move Camera (while paused) = W/S</li><li>Change Speed = Page Up/Page Down</li><li>Quit = Escape</li><li>Toggle Fullscreen = F11</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Programming: Joel Schumacher</li><li>Music: jkx feat. Flipso (Jan &amp; Philipp Koerver)</li></ul>Post-Jam Version:<p>I kept working for a couple more hours to remove negative scores all together (I wasn't sure during the jam and then was sure shortly after submission), alternative controls (IJKL as arrow keys), gamepad controls, ability to mute audio (N) or music (M) and a really cool zoom-out when you press escape.</p><p>If you want to play it, head over to GitHub! <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b7/8b75cf5da37ed06124076f2e79d9ce49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pfirsich"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
