A 2D platformer Puzzle Game made with Godot.<br/>The game where you can \u201cgrowth\u201d\u00a0 different things to achieve the goal of reaching the next room. When you hover the mouse over something\\nthe red marker tells you if it can grow.\u00a0 The EXIT marks, well, the exit. You can always restart the level with the button or \u201cR\u201d key.<br/>Whenever you make something grow it makes some physical property change.<br/>When enemies get bigger they become slower. In opposition when you make anything grow, you shrink. That makes you smaller, faster, but you jump less and is harder to control your character.\u00a0Your jump is variable. As more you press the jump key, you go higher.</p>\n<p>Enemies can collide with each other.\u00a0 Use this to your advantage.<br/>Beware, all things can grow until 5 times, individually. But you can only use 6 'growth' per level. You CAN\u2019T undo, choose wisely\"</p>\n<p>You have a time limit for each level.
