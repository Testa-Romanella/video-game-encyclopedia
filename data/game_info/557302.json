I'm new to game development and made this for a roll-a-ball school assignment. There's still no scoring system or anything much in this game yet, its very, very early stage and just aesthetics but I\u00a0had a lot of fun crafting it! Hope you guys will also enjoy it. :)<br/><br/>Story:\u00a0<br/>You are a Red Dragon stuck in the form of a ball because you have killed and eaten many innocent lives in the past. To atone for your sins, you have to eat all the sushi in the world but who knows when you will really be released from your cage.<br/></p>\n<p>How to play: <br/>WASD to move.\u00a0The player starts on a platform at its home shrine, you have to eat (pick up) all the sushi littered around the world.\u00a0 There's no big goal in this game yet, you are meant to simply enjoy the aesthetics for now. I might add more progression and objectives to the game in the future.<br/><br/>More info:\u00a0<br/>This game is Japan-themed, I have used many Japanese objects and buildings around the map because I like Japan and would love to visit it someday. xD<br/><br/>Thank you for noticing my smol crappy\u00a0game~ UwU<br/>Have fun tumbling down the hill lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:16:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eac/eac6d1907cc6dd8a037710023ee33365.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 461, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wasabi3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
