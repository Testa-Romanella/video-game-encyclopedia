The game introduces two dynamic classes: Hunters and Hiders, each with its unique set of abilities and strategies.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, both Hunters and Hiders are equipped with a random spell, injecting an element of unpredictability and excitement into the gameplay. These spells can range from simple disguises to more elaborate transformations, adding depth and complexity to the gaming experience.<br/><br/>As each round concludes, the selection process randomly determines who takes on the roles of Hunters and Hiders, ensuring a fresh and unpredictable gaming experience each time. Hiders, equipped with the power to transform into over 200 different objects scattered throughout the game map, face the challenge of blending in seamlessly to evade the Hunters' keen eyes.<br/><br/>The Hunters, on the other hand, must use their sharp wit and keen observation skills to identify and shoot the Hiders. However, every shot taken by a Hunter exacts a cost, deducting 1 second from their overall time allocated to find all the Hiders. This strategic decision adds a layer of tension and urgency, pushing both sides to think strategically and act swiftly.<br/><br/>Overall, Gamebesh's Prop Hunt experience offers a guarantee of fun and engaging gameplay, where each match brings new surprises and challenges, making it a thrilling and dynamic experience for all participants.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-20T02:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ee/7ee7bf333d34207f12f0787e30300f2e.jpg", "website": "https://gamebesh.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["voyeslav", "Begej Studio"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Begej Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
