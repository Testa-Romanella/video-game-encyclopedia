It is a snake clone but on a planet. You play in it in the world of aliens.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So the gameplay is really simple. Your Astronaut keeps on walking and behind him some aliens will spawn.</p>\n<p>But they won't remain forever. Roughly said: if one alien is appearing then the alien on the very end will leave you.</p>\n<p>You can increase the number of aliens following you by collecting bottles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Those bottles will spawn on random places all around the planet. You start with 10 bottles.\u00a0But new bottles will first spawn when you've collected the 8 bottle in the world.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>When the game starts it is very important that you reach the first bottle to get points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With every second you will loose points. Reaching zero points =&gt; Game Over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You start with 5 points which means:\u00a0you have 5 seconds to reach your first bottle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After you have collected your first bottles you probably don't have to be afraid anymore to run down to 0 points. Then it is more about trying to keep your score as high as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0Dream Arcade Archive Game-Jam. I hope you enjoy it. Please give me feedback and let me know what you like and what could be improved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also will provide all the assets I've created to make this game for free.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And again special thanks to\u00a0TallBeard's Music loop bundle. This is now the second game where I make use of his tracks and I'm more than happy with it. His music is really providing a great atmosphere so that my game benefits a lot from it!\u00a0 If you are looking for game music - I really can recommend his work.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:11:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65d28d64e4bd25d8a7db083733a6f1a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
