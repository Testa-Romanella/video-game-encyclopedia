You've been hired by the prestigious Logistics Dumping (LD) Waste Management Corporation to operate vehicle #0042!</p>\n<p>As you well know, the trash depositories (or \"dumps\" as the locals call them) are getting rather full. In order to manage how much waste is being processed at any one time, we at LD Waste Management require our operators to think creatively in deciding when to pick up our customers' waste.</p>\n<p>While some may view any waste sitting outside as a problem, we understand that technically, to fulfill our contractual obligation to the state, we need to remove waste only when a sizable amount has accumulated.</p>\n<p>Be wary, however, as keeping homes at a high level of waste buildup will increase the potential for their owners or the state to file a complaint against us, and unfortunately, we are required by law to fire you on the spot if you have accumulated five (5) or more complaints.</p>\n<p>Remember, you're paid based on the volume of waste collected, so get out there and manage that waste like a pro!</p>\n<p>Have a great first day, and congratulations again on your new career in waste management!<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>==Controls==<br/>W/Up Arrow \u2014 Forward<br/>S/Down Arrow \u2014 Reverse<br/>A/Left Arrow \u2014 Turn Left (Only while moving)<br/>D/Right Arrow \u2014 Turn Right (Only while moving)<br/>ESC - End your run early and quit the game</p>\n<p>When you begin, trash will accumulate in front of homes in the neighborhood. Position your truck in front of a home to collect its waste. A meter will fill above the truck to show how full it is, and when the meter is full, you will no longer be able to pick things up until you go back to the dump and wait for the truck to empty.</p>\n<p>You will have to plot a course that allows you to regularly hit each home \u2014 if you allow trash to accumulate too much, the residents will start submitting complaints against you. When a home is getting near that limit, a yellow \"!\" will appear above it.</p>\n<p>Try to gather as much trash as you can before the complaints pile up!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fab/fabd794cf39acdd83e3930848df9054e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EthanTheBrave"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
