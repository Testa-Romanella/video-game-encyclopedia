You do not need that large a room to play the game, but you can walk around however much space you have to get a better view of the action!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The warping from one side of the screen to the other has been updated to warp the ship to the opposite side of the play area no matter which side the ship exits from.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>3D rotation of the ship is handled by rotating your controller in any direction. The grip button activates your thrusters, and the trigger button activates the laser.</p>\r\nSounds\r\n<p>The classic sounds keep the feeling of the\u00a0original arcade game, along with 3D positional audio help you locate your ship and enemy UFO within the room.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T03:04:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/6058fc87a9beb7d9f0b7e4c9768827a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hookmanuk"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
