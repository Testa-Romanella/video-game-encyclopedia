Built in the C Programming language, utilizing SDL2 for Graphics and sound.</p>\n<p>It's a simple puzzle game where you are out of control, as in \"your moves are a resource\". You can collect new ones, and have a limited supply of each.</p>\n\n<p>I made this together with my sister. She did graphics, I did the programming.</p>\n<p>There is no sound, and only 8 levels so far, as I could not use the full 48 hours unfortunately.</p>\n\n<p>There is however, a small tutorial and story.</p>\n<p>All in all, I still hope you enjoy it, as I certainly had a lot of fun during the jam! I will definitely try and partake in the next one. Oh, and Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:36:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c78/c789e8fb7676ca6404e9998579771f64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["boi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
