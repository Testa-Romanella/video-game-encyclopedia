Now December has come around and instead of\u00a0getting to make toys like the other elves, Santa is making him\u00a0sort the letters! No one likes sorting the letters, but if Tiny can sort\u00a0enough letters correctly before Christmas, he can go back to\u00a0making toys next year. Enter Tiny Twinklepants' newest invention:\u00a0The Naughty and Nice Checker 3000!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Use WASD to move</p>\n<p>Use E to drop items</p>\n<p>Touch falling items to pick them up - but only one at a time!\u00a0(Tiny Twinklepants has tiny hands)</p>\n<p>Press SPACE to add and remove items from the stations\u00a0around the room (They can only hold one thing at a time!)</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to get as many points as possible!</p>\n<p>You get points every time you put an object in the right place.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Pick up an incoming letter</p>\n<p>2. Use the NNC 3000 to see whether the letter you're holding is on\u00a0the naughty or nice list</p>\n<p>3. Put naughty letters in the furnace to turn to ash, and put nice\u00a0letters on Santa's desk to get points!</p>\n<p>4. Wait for Santa or the Furnace, then put ash in the rubbish bin and\u00a0give reply letters to the postman for more points!</p>\n<p>5. Don't let anything fall out of the screen, and don't mix up the\u00a0naughty and nice letters or you get points removed!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known bugs:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>You can't drop the ash item without immediately picking it up again - will fix when there are more things to fix at the same time</p>\n<p>My high-score is now 19, not 15 - comment your score below for others to try to beat!</p>\n<p>Leave a comment or contact me for anything that doesn't seem to work</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T20:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b869ddc779e6033aa219e5b50db009.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Soos92s"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
