My name is Noah I'm 18 and I've been interested in indie game development for as long as I can remember, <em>Mechanized Mutiny</em> is my first completed project that I am publishing and I am proud to say that I am entirely self taught and all the game's assets where created by me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing my game, I encourage you to\u00a0leave\u00a0feedback in the comments and maybe send a dollar or two my way as I'd sincerely appreciate it and I'd\u00a0love to devote my self to indie game development full time! I have countless ideas for awesome games that I'd love to create and I learned so much just from doing this one project, I can't wait to get started on the next one !\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T05:45:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/20813a0f5f98039dad4e194668a065cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noahstieler"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
