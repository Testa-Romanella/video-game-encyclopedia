Choose each bridge carefully to climb high mountains, harvest food for towns, and avoid being the target of a cannon.<br/><br/>Summit Way offers 10 regions with a total of 72 levels, from a relaxing start to increasingly difficult levels. Start off by finding any solution to the first few levels, letting yourself be guided by the sound of the wood falling in place. And then, challenge yourself to use as little planks as possible to earn a 4 stars score on all levels, and share the trickiest solutions with your friends!<br/><br/>As you progress in Summit Way, pay attention to the kind of hills your bridges land on:<br/><br/>\u2022 Hilltops covered in trees can be cut down to create more planks and longer bridges.<br/>\u2022 Towns ask for a unit of food to use their hill, make sure to harvest a farm for each town.<br/>\u2022 Castles require a payment in gold to use their hill, you need to conquer a mine to fulfill the need of each castle.<br/>\u2022 Hills defended by cannons cannot be reached until the canon itself has been conquered.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T03:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/908/9085cdac526b00bdfe0ea9cb35d8b4b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alexis Laferriere"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Alexis Laferriere"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
