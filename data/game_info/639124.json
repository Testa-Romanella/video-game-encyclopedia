In the future, after the end of the Game Jam, I plan to improve the translation and finalize a number of other aspects of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T06:10:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c90/c90e02a663e05c8cf6de46b3cf3ddb53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lotrein"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
