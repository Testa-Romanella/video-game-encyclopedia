{"id": 111739, "slug": "the-dare", "name": "The Dare", "name_original": "The Dare", "description": "<p>This is a little game made with Twine. It's about a young child entering a haunted house and their quest to get back out again. The house is based off a real house I know but the interior is purely fictional. The game is an attempt to marry Twine with aspects of survival horror and classic adventure with riddle solving.</p>\n<p>You can move freely around the house but will lose sanity bit by bit. It is a finite ressource that can be replenished by some items you have on you, namely drink and food from home.</p>\n<p>Some of the riddles are somewhat randomized. Should you fail and restart, don't expect everything to work the same way. Look for clues to help with the attic. Enjoy the ride!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6da508edf9cd72c80a47b5ac86848af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MadZab"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
