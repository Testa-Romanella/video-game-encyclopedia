How do we know what it is? Asking them directly? No! By checking their social media, of course. What a society we live in.<br/><br/>Today, the elephant doesn't want to be behind the clarinet (superstitious maybe?)<br/>The lion will ONLY play if he's at the front (what an ego...)<br/>The panda wants to be between two other animals with fur (is that for warmth perhaps?) <br/><br/>Read the clues, re-arrange the animals, and attempt to march!<br/>It's simple at first, but more animals and clues will be added every few successful marches.<br/><br/>If you want to add an element of reactionary skill to the game, try playing against the clock in hard mode!<br/><br/>Code by Tom Vian<br/>Art by Adam Vian<br/>Music by Calum Bowen<br/><br/>Testing help by Armel Gibson, Ricky Haggett, Chris Jeffrey, Eli Rainsberry, Edwyn Tiong", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T02:54:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d9/1d95b96693d8514455d6ad272b81768e_ym6xmKa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SFB Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SFB Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
