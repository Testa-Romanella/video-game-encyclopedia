{"id": 430504, "slug": "swoosh", "name": "Swoosh", "name_original": "Swoosh", "description": "Swoosh is a casual platformer that lets you use 2D physics to traverse its levels, from bouncing, rolling, pulling and sticking get through a level to get to the next. There are different types of surfaces which can be identified by their colour, sticky red, border blue, impassable purple and so on. The game relies on some experimentation from the player to find a way through some levels or getting the right combination of power and angle to get to the next platform. Not much more to it pure and simple game to spend some spare time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T05:30:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/252/2529a04762f48e1847814a1e03f69619.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MCL"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MCL"], "esrb_rating": null}
