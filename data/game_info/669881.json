My group tried to follow it by implementing signs of life in toys because kids play pretend with them and give them life with\u00a0imagination. The gameplay involves giving these static toys winder keys that spin to bring them to life.</em></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>created by jackson clayton and bigninjachicken, with music from\u00a0lukepass86\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:54:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f6/2f6648596aed93222a86bcfecc060521.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JKClayton"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
