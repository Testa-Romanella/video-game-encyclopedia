Flap around whilst trying to dodge various pipes. Start out by dodging static pipes, and as you progress into higher levels, you will be introduced to harder-to-dodge moving pipes. There are 10 levels, with a scoreboard to show the top-tier Flappy Butt point collectors. After completing all 10 levels, restart playing Flappy Butt with a higher difficulty, requiring more points for each level. On your journey to flap as far as you can, you can also collect toilet paper to show off to other Flappy Butt players!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T04:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/112/112e1769ee8b201aaeec9b92b9f5c464.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steven DiLeo"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Steven DiLeo"], "esrb_rating": null}
