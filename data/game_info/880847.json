After a short while, lots appear. With the lots come buildings and their residents. The residents drive around the road network you've created and visit other lots.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Playful design\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Liikennematto is inspired  by children's traffic mats. The design of the game follows the traffic  mat basics: mixed perspective buildings, plenty of color, clear dark  outlines.</p>\n<p>Liikennematto is meant for players of all ages and abilities. The UI is free of text and everything's quite large and easy to comprehend.</p><p><em>Mobile gameplay:</em><br/></p><br/>\n<p><strong>Detailed simulation<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Cars move and turn smoothly, avoid collision with each other, follow traffic signals and park on lots. Drivers plan their routes ahead and follow them the best they can - rerouting when necessary.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Peek under the hood<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Debug utilities are included. You can add more traffic, visualize the road network that's used in the simulation, and see the cars' routes.</p>\n<p><strong>Work in progress<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Liikennematto is in alpha state, so it still has some rough edges. The art and sounds are subject to change. There's not a lot of content, yet. More will follow!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T13:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/598/598edd15081b916641b9e4874d167a6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yourmagicisworking"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
