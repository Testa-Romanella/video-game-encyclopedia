The run is over when you lose all lives and you get a score based on how far you got. You can jump, move and dodge to avoid pattern based enemy attacks, and shoot the enemy to defeat him with your powers. Each boss fight comes with a unique arena and a series of fighting and \u201ccutscene\u201d sequences.\u00a0 After each boss fight your powers change with the new equipment you randomly loot. The bosses also drop gold that you can spend at the shop when you come across one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe3a4ad5e97f343431bc3e6eb62a0b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simple", "MycroSparks", "ripflux"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
