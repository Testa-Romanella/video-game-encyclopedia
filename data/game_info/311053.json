After each turn, you will only know the position of the successful hits inside the enemy unit, without knowing the exact position on the board. You need to search for patterns to find all the units of your opponent before he can find yours. And remember, after each lost unit, shooting power will decrease. <br/> <br/>[Features]<br/><br/>\u2022\tNotebook like design, \u201cpaper and pencil\u201d style drawings<br/>\u2022\tStandard game play and blind mode for experienced users<br/>\u2022\tSingle player mode for lonely days<br/>\u2022\tMultiplayer mode, you can play with friends over WIFI or Bluetooth<br/><br/>[Notes]<br/><br/>For best networking experience please ensure that you have the latest iOS version installed on your device", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:37:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82a/82a0ae21dd8b61615311f0366748526e_YepWdl6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zoltan Pap-David"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Zoltan Pap-David"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
