This is used for debugging, the controller doesn't have a restart button)<br/></p><p>Backspace - Navigate back in Battle Menu<br/></p><p>Left Shift - Holding Left Shift allows you to run a little bit faster<br/></p><p>Alt + Enter - Change from fullscreen mode to windowed (or change back)</p><p>[CREDITS]</p><p>Created by Adrian Miasik (Except for the music)</p><p>\"The Snow Queen\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p><p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>\"Corruption\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p><p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/9424b36d7c0443661aeb6b85cc6badd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adrian Miasik"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
