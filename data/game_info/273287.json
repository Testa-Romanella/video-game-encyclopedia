Sadly I did not finish this Ludum Dare. A game about going on quests and upgrading things at the cost of other things. Read on for more or skip to the \"Story\" section!<br/># How to play<br/>If you want to play, you must mouse over resources and press 'e' to mine them.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Press 'I' or the button to open your inventory:<br/>(CURRENTLY ONLY: OIL, KELP, AND ROCKS ARE IN GAME)<br/>Press 'Q' to close that and swim over to the capsule (Far left) mouse over it and press 'E' this will open the shop. You can see what you need to craft a pic. (KELP IS ON SEA FLOOR, ROCKS ARE EVERYWHERE, OIL IS FAR RIGHT)<br/># Story<br/>The goal is to get a pic then you could mine other stuff and eventually upgrade your suit in a similar fashion to crafting, you would be able to upgrade oxygen at the cost/sacrifice of speed or upgrade speed at the cost/sacrifice of oxygen. Avery tool would use oxygen when you mined resources with it and would also have a certain weight that would slow you down. The ultimate goal of the game would be to go on quests.<br/>Unfortunately, I did not have enough time in the weekend to make my vision a reality.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/># FEATURES:\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>An oxygen system, replenish your oxygen in the capsule or venture out, and risk drowning:\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>An inventory system, collect resources and see your inventory grow!\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Gather materials:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Craft tools!\u00a0\u00a0<br/>And that's pretty much as far as I got. :(\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84c/84cf676ba25a6651a6b28adb6ec2c175.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Sharks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
