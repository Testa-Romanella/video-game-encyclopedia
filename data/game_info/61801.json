Myself along with the small<br/>\r\n Mash Games team, have been working incredibly hard to define and develop the future of BMX (and other extreme sports) <br/>\r\nvideo game physics, from an independent level. The community has shown tremendous support through these projects, and <br/>\r\nit's now that I would like to introduce you to....BMX Streets: PIPE.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo please, enjoy some delicious vert ramp boosting and lets SEND IT!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*Game requires mouse input to launch. <br/>\r\n*Game play and Menus require a controller", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56e/56e4b6e5d295dc592fdb6d9fe593e443.jpg", "website": "http://bmxstreets.com/pipe/", "rating": 4.44, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"owned": 25, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mash Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mash Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
