You can pay off your debt to society working at the local ramen shop (which the judge just happens to own\u2026 so that\u2019s a little questionable too) or spend the next 70 years in the slammer. And since raccoons typically only live three to four years, well, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nServe piping hot bowls of soup to the woodland customers and chip away at your fines so you can earn your freedom in this combination Match 3/Restaurant Management game from Weekend Panda. Grab ingredients, fill orders, and don\u2019t be against giving out a freebie or two if your patrons start to get impatient! After all, unhappy customers mean unpaying customers, and it\u2019s profit-or-prison for this plucky raccoon\u2026 Good luck.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T03:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/dae0897151cb2cbf060d9794a2657e36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Weekend Panda"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Weekend Panda"], "esrb_rating": null}
