One day you set out looking for this mystery fish in your kayak\u00a0but are disoriented upon hearing the howl of a wolf. Shaken but not stirred you decide to call it a day and try to make your way back to camp. But which way is it?</p>\n<p>Get back to safety before your health runs out or the battery in the torch, because these piranhas only attack at night!</p>\n<p>Tip: When it's dark, these piranhas don't like flashlights.</p>\n\n\n<p>Thanks for checking out my game, I started working with Unity some 7-8 years ago but only now have I been able to finish a project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have many prototypes for games and apps but this is\u00a0my first to make it here. So feedback is welcomed to help me improve as much as possible. Of course this game is free however, if you would like to donate it wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed. Helping me a whole lot to stay motivated and to work on my other projects as well as improving this. It\u2019s only a passion project for now but I would like it to eventually grow into something larger and even possibly a career.\u00a0</p>\n<p>IOS and Android versions\u00a0to follow soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The original concept was to play this on a mobile device (IOS first choice). Somewhere during development it turned out to be easier to develop this on a PC, so focus shifted to PC development first.\r\n</p>\n<p>Again, thanks for playing and happy gaming! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:34:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/2966717e36bbfed826ae37c209deaab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["bryanodesilva"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
