They can\u00b4t fly because of their tiny and small wings.<br/>You have to remove the blocks without the birds touching the ground (because they don\u00b4t like the ground or there might be cats around). If they are falling on the ground they get angry and you lose!<br/>It features 80 levels (more coming soon) and an addictive gameplay.<br/>There are different kinds of blocks with different properties (&amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bouncy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sliding&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;safe for birds&amp;quot;). <br/>You can remove blocks by touching them with your finger!<br/>Don\u00b4t get angry if you are not able to solve a level. They are all solvable. If you need help on any level just tell us on the &amp;quot;Birds&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;Blocks&amp;quot;-Facebookpage! We will help you!<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: If you have problems starting the game or if it crashes please tell us via support@sprakelsoft.com<br/>Thank you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a4/8a403d3f93fb858adf4e66e5852cce67.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sprakelsoft"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Benjamin Sprakel"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
