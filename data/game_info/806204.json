At least two time periods from medieval to present/futuristic, so maybe 3.<br/>The storyline came from collecting a bunch of event points and throwing them into a randomiser then improvising a coherent story out of them, and winging the dialogue as I made the game according to the plot events.<br/><br/>I thank my friend Kingslayer for wanting a multiverse for inspiring this XD<br/><br/>----------<br/>More thoroughly explained - <br/><br/>As of 31st May 2022, I have been practicing for my challenge stream for, (To use one set of assets to make up a game Using Other People's Ideas On The Day. I am not allowed to script/plan it or know ideas before starting the event.) I have been making a game on the spot.<br/><br/>I admit I came up with the 15-ish plot events myself (looking at various books/DVDs/games around me + using Tavern Boy's original wanted idea) and dumped them into a randomiser, also decided on charas &amp; who has what happen, so it's not QUITE the same as 'Improvise with no pre-planning or event/character ideas' but I am basically only using what I have (made/recoloured) at this moment.<br/><br/>I've 'cheated' in the ways of updating my first ever backgrounds to ones that better fit the tile (8x8-pixel) limits, and using basic characters from RPG Tsukuru/Animorphs.<br/><br/>I know the character in the egg-finding segment is glitched. I cannot TRUE them into vanishing after the first sighting.<br/>I know the water sprite triggers are iffy. Pfft. It's fine with one character but multiple....???? XD I'll figure it out for the 3rd WIP game for my series.<br/>They DO change, but you need to manually change the characters to see land VS water.<br/><br/>This game was also inspired by my friend Kingslayer saying I needed to do something with a multiverse so HERE YA GO!<br/><br/>--------------------<br/>--------------------<br/><br/>Games/Franchises I've made these backgrounds/characters for - (Not just recoloured existing already, made with other assets from scratch)<br/><br/>Detroit Become Human (Mostly the fanseries by Octopunk I'm working on an adaption of, or my own fangame - So areas and character has been used.)
