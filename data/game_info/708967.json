It's pretty barebones as I had alot to juggle outside the Jam but I'm happy with its current state!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is intended for 2 players playing on the same keyboard - one using the left half and the other the right half to control their characters. The goal is to kill the player on the opposite side of the screen. This may seem impossible given the divide between the player locations, but when the player on the left half fires, the bullet actually originates in the right half of the screen - and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Game was developed using the Unity Engine. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T15:38:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3e/f3e0f8da0c514853d28752968b740356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KyzonP"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
