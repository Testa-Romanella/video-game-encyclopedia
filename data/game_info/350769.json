Also strutting across the game's stage are Edward IV, Richard III, Henry VII, and Warwick, the notorious \"Kingmaker\".<br/><br/><br/><br/>The object of play is to eliminate all five enemy heirs and/or win control of the powerful nobles of England. <br/>The Lancastrians start the game holding the throne, and the Yorkists are in exile ready to invade. Kingship can be won or lost several times during the game. <br/><br/>Will Richard III emerge triumphant, or will he perish in battle as he did historically?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You can get the short game demo for PC or Mac from the company website (click on the website link)<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e58/e58a5fe8e0cd3916257a54008700ca80.jpg", "website": "https://blocks-games.com/en", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Avalon Digital"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Avalon Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
