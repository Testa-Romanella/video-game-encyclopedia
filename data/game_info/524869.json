Feel free to contact me on Discord (<strong>.Dremekeks\u00a0 \u2694 \u30a8\u30f4#6880</strong>) if you find any bugs or wanna chat, maybe I'll patch them. I usually am a lead game engineer for my day-job, but I recently lost my job due to COVID-19, so any donations will be appreciated! Maybe I'd make a sequel level.. or if there any requests for meme-style horror games, give me a ring!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cd/3cdb7ec7e3c0c655ba58efd9956de12d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dremekeks"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
