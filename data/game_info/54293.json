Popful Mail was developed by Nihon Falcom for the NEC PC-8801 computer in 1991 and for the PC-9801 in 1992. It was later ported to PC Engine CD-ROM by NEC Home Electronics and to the Sega CD by \"Sega Falcom\", an alliance of the two game companies Sega and Falcom. In 1994, Falcom themselves remade Popful Mail and released it on Super Famicom. SIMS Co., Ltd. translated the Sega CD version and Working Designs published it in North America in late 1994. The PC-8801, PC-9801 and PC Engine CD-ROM versions are for the most part similar to each other, but the Super Famicom and Sega CD versions differ significantly both from each other and from the previous versions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f5/1f56bf3802c41be0d80953d022915735.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SEGA CD", "SNES"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Nihon Falcom", "The Sims Studio", "Falcom", "HuneX", "PC Engine"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Working Designs"], "esrb_rating": null}
