If you're not familiar with continuum, this is a free-for-all style match. You start with 10 lives and last man standing wins.</p>\n<p>- Implement Team Deathmath (same as\u00a0?go twdd). 5v5 or 4v4 games. Each player has 10 lives and last team standing wins.</p>\n<p>- Graphics and adding rocks, add small radar map.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:40:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59b/59bd2f2910158c3b2b3c3556b8b9663c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["willhoyle"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
