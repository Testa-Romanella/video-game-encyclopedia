At the moment, it can be played as a local versus game where each player assumes the role of a faction and tries to come out on top. For the next release, AI will be a key feature so that the game is playable as a single player game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Overworld:<ul><li>Click on the waypoint you want Fyntyn to move to.</li><li>Use the arrow keys to see more of the overworld</li></ul></li>\n<li>During battle:\r\n<ul><li>Selection ring:<ul><li>A+D to scroll through the selection wheel</li></ul><ul><li>S, Space, or Enter to select an action or enter the Skills submenu</li></ul><ul><li>W or escape to move out of the submenu</li></ul></li><li>Camera:<ul><li>Arrow keys to move around</li><li>Shift to move it faster</li><li>Q and E to rotate the map clockwise or anticlockwise.</li><li>F to flip the map</li><li>C to center the map again</li></ul></li><li>Performing actions</li><ul><li>When selecting a skill, the map will indicate which tiles you can perform the action on.
