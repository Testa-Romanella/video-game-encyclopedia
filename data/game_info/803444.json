It dynamically chooses images to create a set used in a memory matching game so each play is different.</p>\n<p>By default the game will use all the pictures it has available, however in the settings you can choose a specific deck to use (will impact the cards and the background images).<br/><br/>Game plays a tiny bit little smoother in the standalone file, so if you enjoy I'd recommend playing on that instead of the browser.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T15:48:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14a/14ab7c20bce0b209378af5ac4dad42bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["alexanderzahir"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
