All innocent fun, I swear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, but I should note that it could get gory, but that all depends on you. I mean if it gets gory, that definitely sounds like a you problem, just saying. It's all just text anyway so if it bothers you, you can stop reading or go back and make... better choices I suppose. But really, if it gets gory, I'm not really sure how that happened since I just wrote a simple, wholesome Christmas story in space. Honestly :)</p>\n<p>There are no images and no music or sound effects of any kind. This is just a plain, boring interactive story, of the sci-fi and Christmas variety.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 5 different main endings, but for 3 of the endings there are 4 different variations in how it plays out depending on your choices, so it may seem like there are more than 5 endings, and there sort of are, but there are 5 distinct endings if that makes sense.</p>\n<p>Play it in the browser on this page, or download it and play it in your browser in a separate tab.</p>\n<p>Happy holidays :)</p>\n<p>(Cover image photo by Max McKinnon on Unsplash)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T06:13:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/632/63250fcd62607e19a1e52ac6070479c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lin Augustine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
