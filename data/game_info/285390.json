{"id": 285390, "slug": "loopbreaker", "name": "LOOPBREAKER", "name_original": "LOOPBREAKER", "description": "<p>This is loopbreaker, a meditative game where you cut lines to break complex shapes into their more basic parts. Easy at first, numerous solutions, and infinite tries means no two people are likely to come up with the same answer.<br/><br/>Currently there are 60 puzzles, ranging wildly in difficulty and size, with more being added as we continue to craft and polish puzzles over the following weeks.<br/><br/>Originally, I conceived of this idea when idly trying to think of the best way to cut apart the plastic rings on six packs of beverages to protect wildlife, while keeping it in one whole piece total. After playing around with it, we've decided to make a small, cheap, and ad-free game around the concept.<br/><br/>For any out there that are math-inclined, this is a game about cutting apart graphs into their spanning trees with no cycles. But knowing this doesn't help you play it any better, so everyone is on equal footing here.<br/><br/>--This game is currently only available in English--<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/><br/>-Meditative<br/>-Range of difficulty<br/>-Optional music and border choices<br/>-60 levels, with more to come<br/>-Short sessions, easy to pick up for just a couple minutes<br/>-Great for perfectionists and completionists<br/>-Absolutely no extra permissions needed</p>\n\n<p>--THIS GAME WAS MADE FOR MOBILE--</p>\n<p>This is a temporary desktop release. The aspect ratio and controls are still all set up for mobile, but the game is quite playable in its current state. Over the coming weeks, we'll port it over the desktop better, allowing proper 16:9 ratio's and finer cursor control.</p>\n\n<p>If you like this game and you want to take it with you on the go, its available on the Google Play Store for under a dollar!
