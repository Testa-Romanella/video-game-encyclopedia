It's inspired by old school\u00a0CRPGs with strict inventory management systems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is as complete as I could make it in 3 hours, but there are many things I would adjust and some bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:\u00a0</strong><br/><br/>Sometimes the game does not initialize properly. I was able to recreate this roughly 1 out of every 20 tests. Relaunch if this happens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The timer doesn't show up until there are 11 seconds left. The timer starts at 30 when you first place an item in a slot.</p>\n<p>The timer doesn't display 10.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Planned Improvements:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Originally I wanted the item value to be arbitrary so players would have to pay attention to what they were slotting. In the game's current state, I would like to tie item value to scale of the item so that you're better rewarded for managing to fit large, irregularly-shaped items.</p>\n<p>The timer obviously needs to be fully reworked.</p>\n<p>More layouts, more scenarios and complications, just more in general.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I made this game with the pro version of Construct 3. Build time was just under 3 hours total.</p>\n<p>Sprites are from Kenney's 1-bit mega pack.</p>\n<p>Title vector is from Better Your Life courtesy of Vecteezy.</p>\n<p>Sounds and music are from ZapSplat.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T07:12:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d4/8d4f1b9ee5b178134fd6fefa1e117542.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CallumKeene"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
