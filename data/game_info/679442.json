Started at October 10th, completed October 12th.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This was made for the Wanderjahre Games Narrative Game Jam #2! I managed to crank it out in 2 days with RPGMaker MV, so it's a lot less polished than I'd like it to be. I hesitate to call this \"horror,\" since nothing \"scary\" is really happening.</p>\n<p>Do note that I'm working on a much longer, more fleshed-out game featuring Naomi and the rest of her story, although it'll be taking a much more different tone than this. This was mostly a personal challenge for me to see if I could finish an interactive scene in 2 days - and clearly, I did. Now, whether or not it's\u00a0<em>good</em> is the real question.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme:\u00a0</strong>Ten Minutes<br/><strong>Restriction:\u00a0</strong>1 Scene</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>TILESETS USED:<br/><br/></strong>RPGMaker MV RTP Tileset<br/>Com_Shou MV RTP Tileset Pack</p>\n<p><strong>PLUGINS USED:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>YEP's Message Core<br/>Irina's Anti Audio Delay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T07:40:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/8472145f2e098eca2912fac32ac32909.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AwesomeTrinket"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
