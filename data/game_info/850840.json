It was created in 2022. This game is the result of 24 hours of hard work and dedication by a creative team. The concept of the game is simple. Elya and Blackstone had a fight again! The whole city has become their personal testing ground, to sort things out. A whole arsenal of various bombs is available to you. Throw bombs at each other until only one remains. You need to destroy your opponent by dropping an atomic bomb. For this, you get points to buy new bombs and to move to the next level. An unsuccessful attempt takes one life from you, and each new level will be more difficult than the previous one. Try to complete your task as professionally as possible and earn the maximum number of points!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T09:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d55/d556d0547cfd86829e664e2669206b71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Johnny Blackstone", "Elya Richi"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["CrazyBlackStoneNR1"], "esrb_rating": null}
