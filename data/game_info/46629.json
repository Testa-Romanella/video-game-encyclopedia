In this 2D sidescroller, you will destroy hives of aliens living on the aforementioned planet.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the only way out is to destroy the central hive controller that psychically links each of the Kyzt in a hive together.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You will be placed at a specific location on planet <strong>Ky</strong>. From here, you must destroy the psychic <strong>Cores</strong> that are planted around the hive's area. Once all <strong>Cores</strong> have been destroyed, you will face off against the hive controller. Simple, right?<br/><br/>Well, not quite.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, your standard-issue laser gun doesn't have the power to get through the psychic shields that surround the <strong>Cores</strong>. Fortunately, our finest minds have modified your standard-issue laser gun to use <strong>Special Energy</strong> as ammunition. <br/><br/>To put it simply, this means that you can use <strong>Special Energy</strong> to penetrate the <strong>Core</strong> shields. You can gather this <strong>Special Energy</strong> from defeated Kyztlings. <br/><br/>Good luck!<strong>Regarding the demo:</strong><br/>The demo is on its way! As soon as I've finished making it, it'll be in your anxious hands for you to interact with.
