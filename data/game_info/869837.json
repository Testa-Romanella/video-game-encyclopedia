To complete this mission you have to MOVE your villagers (using WASD or arrow keys) through the fire and collect shields scraps. When you have enough shields scraps you can place real SHIELDS on the map by pressing F. These shields are a safe place for your VILLAGERS: there, the fire won't come. To save permanently the village you have to collect 3 special RUNES. Runes appear when you place a specific number of shields.
