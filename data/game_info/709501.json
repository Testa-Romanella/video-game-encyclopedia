However, be careful not to drop them on the ground or they will break!\r\n</p>\n\n<strong>VIP Customer\r\n<br/></strong>\n<p>Complete all three of the VIP Customer\u2019s orders to start the Happy Hour! During the Happy Hour, customers appear with higher values and the barman gives more cocktails, allowing you to score even more.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong> <br/></strong></p>\n<strong>Hot-Bombs<br/></strong>\n<p>Beware of the bombs! A bomb exploding on a cocktail, an ice patch or an infected customer, will destroy it, and throwing it back at the barman will anger him and cause him to enter its berserk mode. Don\u2019t let it explode on you or you will lose time!\r\n</p>\n\n<strong>Berserk Mode\r\n<br/></strong>\n<p>The barman starts throwing several cocktails in an attempt to overwhelm you, this is a chance to prove your worth by successfully delivering them to a customer and scoring even more!\r\n</p>\n\n<strong>Frozen Cocktails<br/></strong>\n<p>Unique to the third level, frozen cocktails become a slippery ice patch when dropped on the ground. Serve them to a customer to temporarily freeze him and accumulate combos.\r\n</p>\n\n<strong>Rats\r\n<br/></strong>\n<p>During the last level, rats will attack customers! Customers infected with rats take damage which occasionally removes time from the timer. Dash on them to get rid of them and get a bonus score!\r\n</p>\n<p><em>The Right Shot was made during a five-month internship at The Game Bakers by Maya Hill, Leelou Puech and Louise Jandot Dit Danjou. </em><br/><em>A big thank you to our mentors at The Game Bakers for overseeing this project and supporting us until the end!</em><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game design &amp; level design :</strong> Maya Hill, Leelou Puech<br/></p>\n<p> and Louise Jandot Dit Danjou\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dev :</strong> Maya Hill\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Art :</strong> Louise Jandot Dit Danjou<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Musical credits\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Main theme :</strong> Royalty free music from www.bensound.com\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Composer: Benjamin Tissot)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Happy hour theme :</strong> Musique par https://www.musicincloud.com\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>SFX under Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence (CC BY 3.0) by:</strong></p>\n<p> original_sound , davethetech , Hawkeye_Sprout , Glaneur de sons , EminYILDIRIM<br/></p>\n<p> <br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>We have chosen to use the \"Pay what you want\" monetization system, all the profits will be donated to the \"Secours Populaire\" association.\r\n</p>\n<p>This association offers people who are victim of social injustice, poverty, hunger and armed conflicts a second chance. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:12:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a94/a94a0209e5ce3da7112579e9e31def4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Bakers"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
