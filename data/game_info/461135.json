PAL and NTSC compatible.</em></p>\n<p>Baaary: mutton commando is a cyborg sheep from the future who must preserve the future of mutton-kind by defending the fields from an invasion of meanies.</p>\n<p> Armed with a plasma spitter, Baaary is dropped into a field to eliminate all of the meanies. Once all of the meanies in a field are eliminated, Baaary will be collected and moved to the next field that needs clearing.</p>\n<p>Some of the later fields may have been affected with stronger or weaker gravity. Be careful not to jump into orbit from fields with weak gravity.</p>\r\nBasics of the game\r\n<p>Firing your plasma spitter, moving and colliding with meanies will consume energy. Standing still or shooting a meanie allows Baaary to regain energy. The more energy Baaary has, the faster he will move and the score awarded for eliminating a meanie will be higher.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If his energy gets too high, Baaary will burn out.</li>\n<li>If his energy drops too low, Baaary will run out of power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Burning out, running out of power, falling down one of the many holes of doom or jumping into orbit will end the game.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the joystick in port 2 to move left and right. Push up on the joystick to jump - you can double jump to clear larger obstacles.</p>\n<p>Press the fire button on the joystick to fire your plasma spitter. Hold down the fire button for auto-fire (but keep an eye on your energy).</p>\n<p>To succeed at Ewe Woz 'Ere, you will need nerves of steel as well as accuracy with your weapon to ensure you manage your energy levels.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Coding and Graphics:\u00a0</strong>Chris Page<br/><strong>Graphics: </strong>Rose Page<br/><strong>Graphics and Music: </strong>Brent Page</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:24:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7f37409dc4728f21b7d4e931bd1e5af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DESIGN/chaos"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
