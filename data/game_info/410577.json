You have no idea what those parts are, but you know you need it, to save the ship and the crew.</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>Find 3 parts laying around in the ship that you can assemble to a toolkit at the workbench. Be careful! Sometimes there are more than 3 parts and you can build the wrong toolkit. Bring the correct toolkit to the broken ship part.</p>\n<p>Repeat till you eventually die.<br/><br/>Note: This is the result of the GGJ 2020, so there will probably be no further updates. I just wanted to put it up here on itch, because I was proud of it.<br/>You may encounter some bugs, but the state of the game is stable and very enjoyable.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Also my art assets are available in this free asset package:<br/>https://spark3dvision.itch.io/low-poly-3d-assets</p>\n<p>Credits: https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/over-repaired-5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:08:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/815/81546462f9c85c24f979ea5d9111ac4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spark3Dvision"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
