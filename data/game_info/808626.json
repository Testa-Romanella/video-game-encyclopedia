This planet was a refuge for humankind after the war that would end all wars on Earth. Over the years, the greed of humankind began to grow which led them to breach the surface of Ceredium-7. However, Ceredium-7 had a mind of its own and took some precautionary measures to force humankind back into the stars and protect herself from any further harm. Without Ceredium-7, humanity would become extinct as there was nowhere else for them to seek refuge, so it is up to you to take control of AWAK3-N Bots, which were the war robots used in the war to end all wars, to counteract the plague that was released by Ceredium-7 to ensure humanity\u2019s survival.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T19:08:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3ee655516b1204f9304cccd44baa25fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Dark Side Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
