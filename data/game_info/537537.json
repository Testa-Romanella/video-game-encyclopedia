{"id": 537537, "slug": "ricardos-maze", "name": "Ricardo's Maze", "name_original": "Ricardo's Maze", "description": "<p>You are alone with Ricardo in his maze. Your goal is to find all the drawings of Ricardo which will spawn the key to escape the maze. But beware, Ricardo is roaming this maze! If you sprint he can hear your steps so try to walk and look around every corner. Hopefully Ricardo is always playing his favorite song so you can always estimate his position. The closer he is,\u00a0 the louder it gets. Also he runs a bit faster everytime you find a new drawing. However you can stun Ricardo with your flashlight. Light makes Ricardo dancing and gives you space to explore the maze. If your flashlight is running out of juice you can always find batteries scattered in the maze.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Navigation - W A S D</p>\n<p>Pick up/Use items - E</p>\n<p>Flashlight turn on/off - Left click</p>\n<p>Sprint - Left shift\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Hints</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Listen to Ricardo's music to check his position.</li><li>Don't overuse the flashlight.</li><li>You can stun Ricardo with the flashlight</li><li>Sprinting makes noise.</li><li>When you get all 7 drawings the key will spawn in the anvil.
