We can in the virtual reality experience  wonder in new, calming worlds.<br/>A remarkable intersection between art, pain relief, and exercise.<br/><br/><strong>some voices in betatesting:<br/><strong>wow! So beautiful and peaceful! I want to use this as a relaxing break in my computer work! <br/><br/>I love the small figures in the sea landscape and the growing flowers in the yoga session.</strong><br/><br/><strong> So beautiful music and peaceful surroundings! The voice of the psyiotherapist is so relaxing!</strong><br/><br/><strong>So nice to walk around, looking for growing flowers and make the waterdrops water the landscape.<br/><br/>I forgot my pain and that I am in a boring institution! thank you! so full of fantasy and awe! </strong></strong><br/><br/>Within the VR-headset, the player is surrounded by calming forests and oceanscapes, sounds of nature, and classical music. <br/>The player can also perform yoga and physiotherapy exercises with a personal, virtual trainer. <br/>By orienteering with a map in a 3D environment, the player can practice and develop their cognition.<br/>The exercises and movements have been designed by professional yoga instructors and physiotherapists that work with rehabilitation.<br/><br/>Virtual Rehab<br/>ART4Health<br/>VR design \u00c5sa Egn\u00e9r<br/>Programming Johnny Nyman, Softwarehut Polen<br/>Modelling Carolina Ask, Evermotion, Polen<br/>Music Satie, Grieg, Debussy, Bach, Mozart, Ravel, Schumann.<br/>Pianist Jonathan Sersam Sound Hans Nilsson och Joar Egn\u00e9r L\u00f6fberg<br/>Motion Capture HumLabb, Lunds Universitet Video David Blomquist<br/>Yoga- and voice instruction Michaela Tellenmark<br/>Physiotherapy Ulrika Bj\u00f6rck, Caroline Dahlberg<br/>Voice instruction physiotherapy Oliver Lindman<br/>Dancer Osama Al Shihabi Character modelling Peter Flygenring Toft<br/>Business advisor Anne-Sofie Frey.<br/>Created with support from Vinnova Innovation.<br/><br/>Credits: Theis Madsen MD&amp;CEO CopenRealityApS. <br/>Virtual Rehab has been further developed from a prototype called \u201cVirtual Recovery\u201d.<br/>The basic idea and prototype were developed in a collaborative project between VR designer \u00c5sa Egn\u00e9r, Kreativitetsbanken<br/>and Dr Theis Madsen, CopenReality ApS. The prototype was funded by Cross4Health.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>MENU<br/>In the game\u2019s menu the player can choose<br/>options for language, environment, exercises,<br/>standing or sitting, and easy or more advanced difficulty. Easy difficulty excludes<br/>movements above shoulder height.<br/><br/>EXPLORATION:<br/>Yoga, Physiotherapy<br/>The player can explore visual and calming<br/>worlds at their own pace, either by sitting<br/>or standing. By using the controller, the<br/>player moves through ocean- and forest<br/>environments, and makes their way to either<br/>a yoga- or physio-therapy exercise with<br/>different difficulty levels.<br/><br/>3D Orienteering<br/>VR enables a unique opportunity to train 3D<br/>orienteering via a map. This may develop the<br/>coordination between mind and body, since<br/>the player learns to navigate to different<br/>targets.<br/>Yoga och Physiotherapy<br/>Through paintings, the player enters either<br/>an oceanscape or a redwood forest. They are<br/>then automatically transported to a previously chosen yoga- or physiotherapy session.<br/><br/>Rewards<br/>Besides relaxation, exploration, and exercise,<br/>the player is rewarded with for instance growing flowers and trees, northern lights, and<br/>water drops. These rewards and the beautiful<br/>environments and sounds can create awe and<br/>motivate the player to return to the game and<br/>the exercise.<br/><br/>Personal Trainer<br/>The player exercises with other 3D-characters, which simulates a group session with a<br/>virtual instructor.<br/><br/>Research<br/>There are many scientific reports about the<br/>advantages of VR.
