I think I could have executed one of the stories better, but overall I think I made a pretty clever game.<br/></p><p>Placed 8th in the 2013 Interactive Fiction Competition.</p><p>Inspired by the following webcomic by Ryan North: http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=675</p><p>There are also books based on the concept!
