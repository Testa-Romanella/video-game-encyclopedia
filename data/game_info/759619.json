It\u2019s a great time for Danielle; she\u2019s finally been given freedom, responsibilities, and the chance to meet new people, in fact she\u2019s been lucky enough to meet a guy, James, and they\u2019ve started dating. It\u2019s new and exciting, exactly the way that love is supposed to be \u2013 the perfect romance!</p>\n<p>At least, it was.\r\n  </p>\n<p>It started out innocently enough when James wanted to know who she was hanging out with and where she was going, but lately he\u2019s been acting differently. He quickly becomes jealous when Danielle spends time with her friends instead of him and she\u2019s beginning to worry about what might happen if she upsets him. Would things escalate further? How will he react? These are the hard questions that are starting to loom in Danielle\u2019s mind, and her friends aren\u2019t making it easier; Hannah keeps telling her to get rid of James, but Emily says he\u2019s just being protective.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is a serious game designed as an intervention around gender-based violence and tells the story of Danielle and James and how their relationship changes.
