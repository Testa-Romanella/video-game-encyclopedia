The story consists of six stages of increasing challenge, all set and timed to an original score for stages and bosses. In the Story Mode, you approach the stages one-by-one and experience the game's cutscenes and character dialogue, but in Arcade Mode, all breaks in the action are stripped away as you attempt to complete all stages consecutively.<br/><br/>Important to the plot is a strange bell that absorbs magic when rung, which is reflected in the central gameplay mechanics. Ring bells to clear enemy fire and absorb gold and other bells- stacking bells together with lots of gold and bullet deletions will send your score into the stratosphere ... alternatively, leverage their magic-sealing properties to protect yourself!<br/><br/>There are three difficulties in the game, Casual, Original and Super- which range from actively assisting the player with mechanics, to being bitterly, insurmountably difficult. Good luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T05:55:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e75/e75ba1e2089dc0b8ec27f1b94540c03d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunacy Indeterminate"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lunacy Indeterminate"], "esrb_rating": null}
