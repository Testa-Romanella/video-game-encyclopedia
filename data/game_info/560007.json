Left click on a hero in the \"Hero Pool\" to add them to the current \"Party\". Left click on a \"Quest\" to send the current party on a quest and watch the quest start. A progress bar will go down on until the quest is complete and the heroes will earn experience and possibly level up. When a quest ends, the party from that quest will go back into the \"Hero Pool\". If a hero levels up, they will have an exclamation mark by their name which means you can allocate stat points to them (by right clicking them while they're in the \"Hero Pool\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>PLANNED FEATURES:</p>\n<p>-Inventory/Equippable Gear for each hero</p>\n<p>-More complex quests (actual behind the scenes combat) (A log of what's happening in each quest and possibly allow you to use items on heroes while on a quest)</p>\n<p>-Different Classes that affect heroes stats</p>\n<p>-Buying/Selling Items and Gear</p>\n<p>-An Ability system for heroes</p>\n\n<p>Let me know of any bugs OR if you have any ideas or feedback!
