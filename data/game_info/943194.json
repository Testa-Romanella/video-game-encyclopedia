The culmination of his life's efforts crumbled from within as his sons turned on each other, throwing his empire into turmoil. He must live through the events of his life to discover what went wrong, and hope to correct his mistakes in this world.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>- WASD to move</p>\n<p>- Left click to attack. Middle click to toggle target locking\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Left shift to dodge</p>\n<p>The demo features two functional stances, representing the emperor's state of mind. Frustration stance disables dodging in exchange for faster movement speed and attack speed. Flow stance features a dodge that can cancel attacks and phase through enemy projectiles, alongside a 4-hit attack combo.</p>\n<p>Since this is a demo, stance switching and boss level transitions\u00a0have not been implemented, so some debug functions have been provided.</p>\n<p>- Equals (=) to toggle between the open world and boss arena</p>\n<p>- Minus (-) to reset the current scene</p>\n<p>- Left Bracket ([) to toggle between the Frustration and Flow stances</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T22:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62d/62d1643a0f17da0633bcbb8e74c4b36b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Do3naut", "fudgeawsome"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
