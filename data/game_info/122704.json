At the time, the idea was only to revive the \"Escape mods\" of Warcraft 3 that Tavrox loved so much. After that he decided to keep on working on it, while his friend Ludo started doing the graphics and level design. Finally, Paul and a friend of his took care of the music. And that's how the small prototype became a full game. Lavapools is available in early access on our website, do not hesitate to try the free demo and buy the latest alpha it if you like it, in order to help us improving the game!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNote :\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe demo corresponds to a previous version of the game that is currently on sale, therefore its graphic quality doesn't correspond to the full game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18c/18cf15dd1f7ce20d1d6fcdd27cbc3513.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4Edges"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
