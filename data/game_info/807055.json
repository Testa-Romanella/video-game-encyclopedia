{"id": 807055, "slug": "dorfs-hammers-for-hire", "name": "Dorfs: Hammers for Hire", "name_original": "Dorfs: Hammers for Hire", "description": "<strong>Dorfs: Hammers for Hire</strong> is an arcade co-op game about a group of dwarven weaponcrafters and armorsmiths, traveling through the world to wherever the scent of war and gold takes them. Participating indirectly in various battles, the crew of the <strong>Dorfenwagen</strong> only has a limited time to deliver all the armaments that the soldiers request, putting them in a constant race against time and the unstoppable advance of the enemy.<br/><br/>But watch out, for the workshop is a battlefield of its own. Fires, wrong combinations, mid-air collisions, hopping fireballs, falling icicles and sticky mud, anything can go wrong... and at least half of those things are caused by your own friends.<h3>Co-Op Campaign</h3>\"A small army has gathered under the command of a young baron, eager to reclaim the lands of their ancestors. As it stands, the baron has heard of us, and we\u2019ve accorded a <strong>handsome</strong> payment for our services throughout his campaign...\"<br/><br/>Up to four players can participate in a Campaign that takes them across 5 Regions and 30 hand-crafted levels as they make their way up the Iron Mountain, each with its own layout, challenges and hazards.<br/>Help the landless baron to reach the Stronghold atop the mountain! Turn his rabble of untrained peasants into a fearsome company of warriors!<h3>Arcade Modes</h3><ul><li><strong>Arcade Classic:</strong> Work together to clear <strong>10 more levels</strong> in any order of your choice. Why not throw an extra <strong>Hazard</strong> in there while you're at it?<br/></li><li><strong>Versus Battle:</strong> What better way to stay sharp than some light competition? Hammer against your friends in this <strong>2v2 Versus mode</strong> in any of the <strong>5 arenas</strong> to fight in! Same level, same items, same challenges. Only your skills and cooperation will allow you to win!</li></ul><h3>Local? Online? Solo Mode? Yes!</h3><strong>Dorfs</strong> can be played with<strong> up to 4 local and online friends</strong> in any combination. Four friends in their own home across the globe? Sure! You and your friend are hanging out and want to include that one guy you met in a lobby 5 years ago? You can play together without a problem.<br/>\"But what if I am a lonely dwarf or my friends aren't always available?\" I hear you ask. Not a problem, either! All modes can be played Solo, compensating the lack of teammates with work tables that go on their merry way on their own.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T05:48:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aab2b58e351886abfb847988bc66527.jpg", "website": "https://ravegan.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ravegan"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ravegan"], "esrb_rating": null}
