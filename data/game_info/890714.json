All improvised, so you end up writing about taking over hell and fighting god. Wouldn't that be f*cked up?</p>\n<p>Well that's what I did!! I signed up for the 2022 Bad Game Jam hosted by the B.A.D. Collective; 7 days later and 7 dollars short, I now have my first real video game \"You Are a Skeleton &amp; That Is a Problem\". I had a lot of fun making it (I went through a whole typewriter ribbon for it!) and I hope you have fun playing it.</p>\n<p>It's bad, but it's so bad it's good.</p>\n<p>p.s. if u like the game enough to donate a couple bucks, i would appreciate it :)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T09:41:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/068/0685b71e84ac5a3cac10c6a13b89330e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nicky Flowers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
