But about one month ago The Space Unicorn On Fire band (who gave me the autorisation to use one of their song for the game) asked me if it was finish and if they can play it. I was ashamed and I decided to finish it for the first birthday of my friend's child !<br/></p>\n<p>I worked hard and here it is, my first game released ! I hope you like it, personally I do, but more important I hope my friend and his wife like it (and the baby too, you never know !)</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to <strong>Space Unicorn On Fire</strong> for allowing me to use their song !
