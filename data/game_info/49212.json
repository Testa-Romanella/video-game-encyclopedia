Her name was Allison. While alive, Allison wrote a personal diary, which is said to contain the truth about her past and the creepy life at the hospital. The diary was never found. A few years later, the hospital was shut down, and became a terrifying, god-forsaken place. You are Guglielmo Carter, a dauntless reporter interested in finding Allison's diary and revealing its hidden secrets.\" <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTaken from real facts, \"The Hospital: Allison's Diary\" is a new horror virtual reality experience, putting the user alone in an abandoned hospital searching for the unknown with only the help of a single torch.
