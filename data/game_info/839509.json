{"id": 839509, "slug": "bit-swap", "name": "Bit Swap", "name_original": "Bit Swap", "description": "<p>Bit Swap is a 1-bit style endless faller game.</p>\n<p>Created for the purpose of\u00a0Midyear 2022 Flame Game Jam.</p>\r\nStory:\r\n<p>Meet Timmy - a young kid whose life was remarkable in a very particular way. Everything he was doing was either of two things. He could only count to two, his body had two colors, the clothes in his wardrobe were either black or green, and his favorite music bands were playing jazz or death metal. One day, Timmy\u2019s parents decided to visit a nearby canyon, and while they were enjoying the views, Timmy couldn\u2019t stop looking down the canyon, thinking about the two of his favorite superheroes gracefully flying down and jumping down like a spider (unfortunately stepping out of the edge was his third thought). Before his parents realized what was happening, Timmy was already falling, imagining himself being like the superheroes. Given the circumstances, this story was never meant to be a tale about a boy graduating from the best university in the country. It\u2019s up to you now to guide him left or right through the canyon full of rock shelves and keep the dream of little Timmy alive as long as possible.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Tap the screen or press space to move the character.<br/></p>\n<p>This game works best on Google Chrome.</p>\r\nAssets:\r\nIcons:\r\n<p>Artwork created by @vectorpixelstar (License: CC BY-ND)</p>\n<p>https://vectorpixelstar.itch.io/1-bit-16px-icons-part-1 https://vectorpixelstar.itch.io/1-bit-icons-part-2</p>Sprites:\r\n<p>Obstacles by Kenney Game Assets(License: CC0)</p>\n<p>https://kenney.nl<br/></p>\r\nMusic:\r\n<p>Kenney Game Assets (License: CC0)</p>\n<p>https://www.1001fonts.com/thirteen-pixel-fonts-font.html\u00a0</p>\r\nSound:\r\n<p>Jump by\u00a0felixyadomi\u00a0(License:\u00a0CC BY 3.0)\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/felixyadomi/sounds/456375</p><p>Crash by\u00a0Vortichez (License: CC BY 4.0)</p><p>https://freesound.org/people/Vortichez/sounds/432627/<br/></p>Fonts:\r\n<p>Thirteen Pixel Fonts Font (License: CC BY-SA)\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.1001fonts.com/thirteen-pixel-fonts-font.html\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>VTF MisterPixel Font Family (License: SIL Open Font License (OFL))\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.1001fonts.com/vtf-misterpixel-font.html</p>\r\nAuthors:\r\n<p>- Marc Sanny (https://eterkit.itch.io)</p>\n<p>- Kamil Powa\u0142owski (https://hydra-softworks.itch.io)</p>\n<p>- Tomasz Wyrowi\u0144ski (https://github.com/tomwyr)</p>\r\nSource Code:\r\n<p>https://github.com/eterkit/bit-swap</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:00:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79be87f3aa7f1f98507db6bb0f743333.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eterkit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
