Curiously, next to some\u00a0powerful-looking machinery in an underground bunker, you've just encountered an old computer terminal which\u00a0provides a miniaturized glimpse of the vast space beyond your home. You've heard stories about how the planet is kept safely\u00a0running through the use of strange technology; perhaps this\u00a0is where it all happens?\u00a0While the view is beautiful,\u00a0you realize the magnitude of the dangers from which the old artificial minds protected us. Unfortunately, the silly AGIs forgot to leave instructions on how to work the darn thing! That's really too bad, because those asteroids are looking a little ominous, and I don't think anyone else knows how to use these monstrous machines. What can this thing do?\u00a0Guess we'll just have to hack into this old computer... We need to hack Haq.</p>\n\n<p>Created in 72 hours for Lux Jam 2</p>\n<p>Theme: \"Hack the planet\"</p><p>Music by Purple Planet</p>\n<p>Assets and music tracks used are listed in the development log below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T10:34:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b3/9b3089abd163816c1afc8649c0a855e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Entropy Maximizer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
