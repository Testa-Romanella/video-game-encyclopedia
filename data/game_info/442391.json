Stay tuned for improved and optimized updates.</p>\n<p>Project site: https://github.com/MutantStargoat/eradicate<br/>Releases: http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/sw/games/eradicate/releases/<br/></p>\n<p>Eradicate attempts to auto-detect the installed sound card, and only asks the\r\nuser for manual sound card configuration if the auto-detection fails. If for\r\nsome reason your sound card is not detected correctly, or if you wish to change\r\nthe current settings, start the game with the -setup option. You will only\r\nneed to do this once; your choices are automatically saved, and will be used\r\nevery time you start the game in the future.</p>\n<p>The GNU/Linux and Windows versions support framebuffer scaling. Use the FBSCALE\r\nenvironment variable to set the scaling factor. For example: export FBSCALE=2\r\nwill result in 2x scaling. Also you can toggle between fullscreen and windowed\r\nmodes with alt-enter.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li>Arrow keys or wasd to accelerate/break and turn</li>\n<li>tab to skip to the next music track</li>\n<li>`+`/`=` to adjust the volume</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game comes with a few appropriate music tracks, downloaded from modarchive. Copyright belongs to their respective authors. You can drop your own music in the `data/musgame` and `data/musmenu` directories to add them to the game jukebox. The game will play files in random order from these directories. The files need to be tracked music in `.xm`, `.mod`, `.s3m`, or `.it` formats.
