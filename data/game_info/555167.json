Use Sekibanki's epic lasers to cure this corruption, and fill the world with happy heads!</p>\n<p>The Q, W, E and R keys can be used to blast your foes with a short range laser. Hold the shift key when pressing any of those four keys to fire off the mega-laser (this has a short cooldown period).</p>\n<p>Go for the highest score and the biggest combo! But watch out - the more combo points you rack up, the faster the corrupted heads will spawn! And if you lose one of your heads, the corrupted heads will start to gang up on whatever remains!</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>(NOTE: I couldn't get the high score feature working, so if you want to show off your high scores, post them into the comments below!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:27:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/4251f9007d50dd37b35cdbb2891ed2f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dapper Cranium"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
