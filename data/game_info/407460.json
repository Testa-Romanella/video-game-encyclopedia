(Robert Ursache)", "description": "<p>This project is an Horror Escape-Room type project.\u00a0<br/>I made this project because of what happened to my\u00a0 grand father a couple of years ago. He walked out of the house and got hit by a car which resulted him being in a hospital for a couple of weeks. Thorough these weeks he was diagnosed with dementia.  He tried to escape the house because he though someone was trying to harm him, so this game has a personal connection to me and I would really appreciate if you could give any feedback on what I can improve on and on what I good.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br/><br/>NEW UPDATED IS OUT!\u00a0<br/>Bugs Updated:<br/></p>\n<p>Added some new walls which means that now the player has to go thorough all the puzzles in order to complete the game!<br/></p>\n<p>Solved the last door bug. Now the open rate is 100%\u00a0and not random. :)</p>\n<p>Changed the narrator voices a little to make it more realistic.</p>\n<p>Changed the plotting of the puzzles a bit because some people found it hard to pass some puzzles.</p>\n<p>NEXT UPDATE: 1ST of February 2020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:47:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c45a5468ae1109bdbc25c667d6af17a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Robert Ursache"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
