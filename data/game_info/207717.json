During the day you must hide from the sunlight under trees and try to stay away from the roaming guards. During the night you have to sneak around guard, in to the huts and feed on the dreams of the sleeping villagers.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tControls:<br/>\r\n\tMovement: Up, Down, Left, Right<br/>\r\n\tEat Dreams: Z<br/>\r\n\tSneak: X<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Postmortem Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
