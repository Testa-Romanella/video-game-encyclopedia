Smash into glowing orb pickups. Orbs give you point and more time. Miss too many orbs and you run out of time and explode. Don't smash into blocks. Three strikes and you're out.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Plays best with mouse or joystick, but keyboard movement is also possible.\u00a0WASD/Arrows are mapped to absolute, cardinal directions: up, left, down, right.</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>More gameplay was planned, but I wanted to limit this to a single month of development time, so I simply attempted to polish and deliver a basic playable build. No plans at this time to develop further, but feedback would still be appreciated so I can learn from this for future games.</p>\r\nTrivia\r\n<ul><li>Total development time: just over 100 hours.</li><li>Feelings about the name: I hate it, but Super Smash was already taken. ~(;</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:32:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/041/04165e07a371cb674f55c7b40f96f622.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cosmic Misfit Drew"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
