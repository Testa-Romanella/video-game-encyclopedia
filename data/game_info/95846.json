In order to do so, you must steal something from your opponent, attach it to your voodoo doll and find ways to hurt yourself so that the<br/>damage is inflicted to them. Utilizing traps in the environment, players can damage and impede their foes. Before the game starts, players have the power to arrange their surroundings, to allow for player influenced level design.</p><p> Our game is inspired by 19th century Haitian Voodoo culture with the concept of causing harm to someone using a doll as a medium and adds comedic value through its cutesy art style. This game creates an enjoyable and competitive atmosphere as you discover multiple ways to hex your friends.</p><p><em>Backstory</em></p><p><em> 1953. The American state of South Carolina saw the largest migration of South Americans, specifically from Haiti, raging around a million. Because of this Voodoo practices grew in areas such as Charleston. This grew around South Carolina and eventually in 1955 to other surrounding states such as Georgia and North Carolina. Because of this the local governments slowly started to attack the Voodoo culture, firstly with investigations into criminals linked in with Voodoo, growing more intolerant and mixing in with the expanding racism at the time, this then led to Voodooism being made completely illegal. Soon after this underground voodoo gangs and fight clubs seemed to grow in popularity, again growing amongst South Carolina and its surrounding states. In these fight clubs Voodoo priests would put their own enchanted Voodoo doll against each other in a chance to win large amounts of money.<br/></em></p><p>If you want to provide feedback you can answer our survey here: </p><p>https://goo.gl/forms/RFSnkMIdeTNdQrZO2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c47/c47e59a0a08ed456ddcd8c23ec813425.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kasandra H.
