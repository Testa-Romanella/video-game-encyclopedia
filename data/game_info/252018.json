This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall to the bottom of the playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>* All Classic Levels.<br/>* Global Leaderboards.<br/>* Suitable for all ages.<br/>* Now try to get a higher score and share it with your friends!<br/>* New levels update every week.<br/>* Free to play, play it anywhere anytime.<br/><br/>Enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/441/4418710b90080b56ec7bc0f4e2b20c9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Trang Nguyen Thi"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Trang Nguyen Thi"], "esrb_rating": null}
