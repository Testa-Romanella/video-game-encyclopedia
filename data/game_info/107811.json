The experience created by Dr. Arend Hintze. Leaving your mind to focus only on the puzzles themselves, this mode is perfect for meditation and learning the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Timed:</strong> Race against the clock to test the speed of your loop solving skills or jump into Insanity mode for the largest and most complex tangles.</p>\n<p><strong>Enlightened:</strong> Test your skills. This mode only uses an algorithm for generating the most difficult puzzles. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/290444d924d0016a6e6bd811256af2d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SiN Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
