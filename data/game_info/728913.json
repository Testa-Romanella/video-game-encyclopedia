It was done in Unity with  C# and took me 11 days to learn and make. Biggest shout-out to Wayfarer Games and to the amazing GDB Discord for all the help provided and teaching in order to make this possible.\r\n</p>\n<p>Really hope you enjoy this game. I will appreciate any feedback or comments.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAlso feel free to follow me on Twitter or to visit my website! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T10:11:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f26/f26e0e092c15cf57740e1ce0128419a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crossedkiller"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
