Every 5 enemies you kill,\u00a0one of them will rise from the dead and fight for you! (Make sure your helpers don't shoot you).\u00a0Be careful though, the undead love action and if they don't get any they'll have to make their own by shooting at you! More action means more points in this game, but more action comes with its risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Point System</strong><br/>Points are awarded on each kill multiplied by the numbers of enemies on screen with the number of seconds you've been playing for added on to the score. If your undead helpers get angry, it's triple points and your helpers are now enemies!</p>\n<p><strong>Anger System</strong><br/>Anger slowly accumulates over time and a LOT of anger accumulates if you try to shoot your helpers (why wouldn't they be angry?). Reduce anger by killing enemies!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Extra Note<strong>s</strong></strong><br/>Your helpers are undead so they're not alive. Please don't try to kill them\u00a0:).<br/>I only made this for Windows. I know Mac doesn't work and Linux might not either sorry.\u00a0\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Message</strong><br/>This is my first ever GameJam so I didn't have any premade assets or music or anything, everything was made from scratch. I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Also tell me your high scores!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>WASD to move<br/>Mouse to aim<br/>Left Click / Space to shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T17:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/947/9472f644ffa3cefc46fc400679370717.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eeewani"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
