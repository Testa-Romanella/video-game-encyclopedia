Those ten players can be TEN PEOPLE, as long as you have a keyboard that has at least 10 keys that is ;) Gamepads should work as well, although I didn't get a chance to test that yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Audio Update:</strong></p><p>The game finally has proper sounds and background music! Sound levels may not be perfect and will be subject to further improvements, but for now: ENJOY!</p>\n<p>Follow the game on Facebook.</p>\n<p>There is a lot more to come in the near future, as I'm planning to do a lot of small incremental updates:<br/></p>\n<p>- more race modes</p>\n<p>- more tracks</p>\n<p>- more car types: motorbikes, trucks, rally cars etc.</p>\n<p>- special challenges for single player games</p>\n<p>- Wi-Fi multiplayer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/917e5fa3145dbd953f12c2cefc634284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Vinyl Pixels"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
