Each player controls a kid and both players can stack on top of each other and disguise themselves as an adult, effectively combining into a single character. When disguised/combined, one player controls movement and the other controls everything else.\r\n</li><li>Each of the two kids has their own unique skill set and the disguised form differs depending on which player is stacked on top or bottom. Each character form/variation may react differently to different obstacles, so changing between them will be necessary for completing levels.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Our Team!</strong></p>\n<p>Gameplay: Andy Chan, Manyu Wang ,\u00a0Murtaza Latif, Wei Cui</p>\n<p>Audio: Josh Sparks, Janise Ku</p>\n<p>Art: Logan Hyde, Mandy Luu, Adriana Lee</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T14:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/913/913b04b1768d96129e41dd287a2ef593.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stacked"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
