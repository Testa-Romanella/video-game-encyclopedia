A rogue machine glitched out and decided to set the building ablaze. But... that can't be right. Surely there's another reason.</em></p>\n<p>Baleen is an interactive story taking place entirely through a chat engine. Kaleb has known his classmates for years, but never really bothered getting too close to any of them. Now he has to play detective, trying to find out who's really responsible for the fire.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1b/c1bcb42b6d13b303e61ca6e4657c5ae4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Koimarina Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
