Though seclusion has made time appear infinite and your memories fleeting, you have still achieved father's goal: Become a Master Sorcerer.\u00a0 But that might not be enough to avoid your pursuers or everything else putting your life at stake.</p>\r\nHazuki Tamashiro | The Jewel Of Kawa\u00a0\r\n<p>Hazuki is Lord Sakuma Tamashiro's oldest son and his most precious treasure. Much like him, Kawa adores its jewel and relishes the few opportunities in which the young Lord is allowed outside the castle walls. Poised, gentle and kind, yet trusting and inexperienced, there is much still to learn about him, much he himself doesn't know.</p>\r\nMasami/Masaru Shiraishi | Devoted Retainer\r\n<p>Masa is the child of Yamato Shiraishi and Masato Shiraishi, both prestiged samurai in the service of the Empire and fallen to the osen. Taken in by the Tamashiro household, Masa has grown attached and protective of Hazuki and all his relatives, vowing to protect them much like their father once did. But things aren't always as simple as we remember, are they?</p>\r\nMiwa Imamura | Charming Performer\r\n<p>Unable to return to the home she once had, Miwa lives in Kawa, cared for by the doting owner of a popular tavern. She is cheerful and charming, yet regardless of her disposition, there at times where you can't help but feel like there is much she hides from you.</p>\r\nKlaus/Katja Rass\u00e9 | Nostalgic Hunter\u00a0\r\n<p>K is one of <em>he</em><em>r</em> hunters, that much you know. Raised in a harsh, competitive and cruel environment, K learned there are few people (if any) they can trust. But there is conflict in their eyes when they look at you, as if they couldn't decide what to feel, how to deal with you.</p>\r\nSaori of Hanzo | The High Priestess (Exclusively Platonic)\u00a0\r\n<p>Saori is the image of poise, of elegance, that is what all who meet her say. She once escaped from an attack in her home village and arrived at the Temple of Hanzo, where Goddess Omi chose her as her most holy. This position has made her wary of your kind and, along with The Master of the Mark, her existence proves dangerous to you and all who share your nature.</p>\r\nContent Warnings\r\n<p>This story deals with topics such as: grief, death, violence, dissociative amnesia, sexual themes (optional and consensual), mentions of child abuse and neglect.
