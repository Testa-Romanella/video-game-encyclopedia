The format and the focus on handmade art is particularly appropriate for personal games like this and I thank you for giving me this opportunity to explore my memories in this way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T07:07:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16bfa7b8de448b2e169fca6db6d88600.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fizzhog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
