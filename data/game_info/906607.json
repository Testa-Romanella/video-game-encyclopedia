Today I kinda regret this choice and would do it very differently. <br/> Also, as I had initially believed it would be a very short game, it has no pause feature, but testing has shown that it is more of a 1h game to complete.</p>\n<p>In any case, I hope you can enjoy this microgame that got me started as an indie gamedev.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T10:43:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f0/7f0f9194c40ba4578bc5722d30df45d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Slax"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
