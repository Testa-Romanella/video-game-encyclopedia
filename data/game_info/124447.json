You have to get the snowball to the finish line as fast as possible!<br/>Sounds easy, right? <strong>Snowballing Out of Control!</strong>\u00a0is a game that takes that simple concept and makes it a bit more difficult.</p><p>When the snowball rolls on <em>snow</em>, it picks up the snow and gets <em>heavier</em>. The <em>heavier</em>\u00a0the snowball is, the more <em>difficult</em>\u00a0it is to move. Roll the snowball on <em>grass</em>\u00a0to drop some snow and get <em>lighter</em>!</p><p>There are also <em>trees</em>\u00a0and <em>snow banks</em>\u00a0in the way. If you hit a <em>snow bank</em>, you'll pick up a lot of <em>snow</em>\u00a0and <em>slow down</em>. If you hit a <em>tree</em>, something <em>disastrous</em>\u00a0will happen. Try your best to avoid them!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>A/Left - move left</li><li>D/Right - move right</li><li>R - restart</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Changes</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>1</strong><strong>.0.2</strong> (4 December 2017) - added support for software OpenGL.</p>\n<p><strong>1.0.1</strong> (3 December 2017) - minor fixes for physics bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>1.0.0</strong> (3 December 2017) - initial release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9a/f9a8543175e13e9dabc2433585472f20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shipshape Detour"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
