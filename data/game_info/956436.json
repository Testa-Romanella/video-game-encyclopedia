We were required to make an infinite runner using this engine\u00a0and this is my final product of that endeavor. You start out with a single player, and the color fades over time. Once all color has faded from the scene, you die. Collect the little orbs to restore colour, biding your time. Collide with the diamonds to \"split\" into additional players that you can independently control. Maintaining multiple players will give a large score boost, however it will also accelerate how quickly color drains. Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f5d56598481a7941e9152e654d458bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["George Wigwam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
