With her partner,\u00a0<strong>John Kindley</strong>, at her side, the two embark on a journey full of mystery and suspense with some laughs along the way.\u00a0<strong>STARDROP</strong>\u00a0tells a genuine heart-felt story about a long lost starship, its crew and one individual in particular.<br/></p>\n<p>\n<strong>STARDROP</strong>\u00a0presents its narrative through traditional cut scenes and in-game cinematic story telling as you play. The main campaign is where the heart of the game's narrative lies but you will also be able to experience the universe of\u00a0<strong>STARDROP</strong>\u00a0through its side missions.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\nExploration lies at the game's core but so does accessibility. While the game offers puzzles and asks the player to figure out what to do or where to go next, the flow of information within the game will always guide you. Objectives are always made clear and designed with logic in mind. However, those who venture off the beaten path will find that there are more than enough secrets to be discovered.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the game the player will be able to interact with various types of interfaces such as control panels, elevators and security systems as well as other various interactive objects such as computer interfaces where you can read emails, listen to audio logs and more.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\nYour\u00a0<strong>All-Purpose-Design (APD) space suit</strong>\u00a0is equipped with a set of tools that you will need in order to succeed. The suit comes with a built-in flashlight. The object scanner enables you to identify objects of interest that you can interact with and it's also capable of zero gravity mobility under certain circumstances.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0<strong>DataPad</strong>\u00a0is an essential tool. It enables you to view your current objective, read audio and text logs that you've collected and it also comes with a built-in mini-map.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\nOur main focus will always be on the game's story but we strife to deliver breathtaking visuals where possible. Our efforts have lead us to win\u00a0<strong>Best 3D Graphics</strong>\u00a0in the\u00a0<strong>Intel Level Up Contest</strong>\u00a0of 2017. We will continue to uphold these standards if not lifting them up even higher.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Four full fledged chapters that concludes the main game's narrative.</li><li>An engaging story enthralled by a captivating mystery.</li><li>Explore multiple spacecraft, Outposts, Stations and more as a salvage &amp; rescue operative.</li><li>A small but diverse cast of characters brought to life by incredible voice talents.</li><li>A range of light environmental puzzles and a touch of stealth.</li><li>Exploration mixed with narrative driven gameplay.</li><li>SRO side missions</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:33:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74b/74bb866a3dad2672201965b3cb918442.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joure"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
