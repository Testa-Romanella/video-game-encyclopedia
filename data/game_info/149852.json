Cannon cards do the greatest damage, but cannons take long to load and you'll be able to complete more attacks by tossing hand mortars, throwing dirks, or firing flintlock pistols.</p><p>Summon a lost pirate from the depths of Davy Jones' Locker or even persuade an enemy pirate to join your crew! Roll doubles in the heat of battle and fate will smile down upon this lowly lot and uncover treasure! No pirate can resist treasure \u2013 especially if it contains voodoo that helps them fight!</p><p>Once you destroy the pirate enemy, you've won! Or have you? The Pirate Ghost gives one last chance and can be a formidable opponent!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d9/6d9379175cc04d337d6a044dd2f7ca98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["SlideWave"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
