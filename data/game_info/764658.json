This game currently has 10 levels, and is on version 0.2. There are 4 obstacle types which consist of, a Trampoline, A speed boost pad, an anti boost pad and an ordinary wall obstacle that will give you a game over on impact.\u00a0I will most likely stop development on version 1.0 or I will continue to update it but keep the updates to bug fixes and tweaks. No major updates after 1.0.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>A + D = left and right.</p>\n\n<p>I've been working in the Unity game engine for quite some time but I've only just got back into developing so I decided to follow a game development tutorial that was created by Brackeys.
