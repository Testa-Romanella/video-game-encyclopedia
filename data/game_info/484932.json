{"id": 484932, "slug": "craft-in-abyss", "name": "Craft In Abyss", "name_original": "Craft In Abyss", "description": "Craft in Abyss allows players to design their own mechanical fortress, gather resources and continuously strengthen the fortress facilities within a sci-fi world. It is a rogue-lite base building game at heart.<br/><br/>The player will need to keep upgrading and expanding the fortress to strengthen themselves during their journey to gather more companions and fight enemies for resources.<h3>Core Gameplay 1: Facilities</h3><br/>In order to construct additional facilities on the fortress, the player will first have to construct a baseplate, which naturally must be connected to the fortress itself. Do note that more baseplates aren\u2019t always better, since additional baseplates increase the size of the fortress, making it easier for enemies to land their attacks as it will be more difficult to dodge the projectiles.<br/><br/>After designing the shape of the moving fortress, the players will then be able to construct facilities on them, then set off to battle.<br/><br/><h3>Core Gameplay 2: Battles</h3><br/>During battles, the players will control the moving fortress, and utilize the rotating baseplates as well as the auto-defence facilities to defeat enemies.<br/>After defeating enemies, the player will game resources, which can be used to strengthen the fortress.<br/><br/><h3>Core Gameplay 3: Skills</h3><br/>After every battle, the player will be able to randomly gain a digital totem, which will come with skills, from the ruins. The player must make good use of the digital totem\u2019s strengths in order to achieve victory.<br/><br/>For example, \u201c+25% damage from main cannon. Main cannon now causes recoil.\u201d A skill like this would allow the main cannon to be used for dodging attacks as well as actually damaging enemies.<br/><br/>The most interesting part of this game is that the players will gain skills randomly, meaning that they won\u2019t be able to actually permanently stick with a layout, and will have to adapt their playstyle according to the skills they receive, thereby providing them with different experiences.<br/><br/><h3>Plot Introduction</h3><br/>\u201cAlex was born and raised in the Underwater Ruins, a sealed megastructure submerged deep beneath the ocean. As a genius engineer, she pilots her battleship alone in search for an exit at the top of the ruins in hopes of finding a solution to the threat of her home disappearing. Yet, what she came across was the mechanical assault from the labyrinth itself\u2026:<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T20:12:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/482/482cc08aa00a35cba3c22b2c60a832bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["firepillar2"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["firepillar2"], "esrb_rating": null}
