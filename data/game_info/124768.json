Something is not right however, as the colonists have been unfrozen too early, and the ship was not meant to sustain as many humans at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Expand its capacity, provide for the people on the ship, make sure they stay happy and sane.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Start up the factories that produce the what you need. Scavenge old resource stashes,\u00a0and ultimately repair the engine malfunction, in order to\u00a0complete your journey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ship has limited space, and it will run out, unless expansion is carefully managed. Plan your moves carefully, and good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>This is our entry for Ludum Dare 42, hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Naimo - Programming, game design<br/></p>\n<p>Mardikas - Programming, game design</p>\n<p>Shadowhaxz0r - 3D\u00a0modelling, misc art</p>\n<p>Dan - texturing, UI,\u00a0misc art</p>\n<p>Morr - idea guy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9e/b9edfc7a1a97ac2a2d4a8b5efe06fd89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["danmakesgame"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
