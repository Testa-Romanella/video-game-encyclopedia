{"id": 373241, "slug": "reordered", "name": "REORDERED", "name_original": "REORDERED", "description": "<p>REORDERED is a puzzle game inspired by the concept of out-of-order delivery in computer networking where the player must reorder the letters of a message sent from an antenna to another\u00a0to\u00a0form\u00a0another\u00a0word.</p>\r\nRun the game\r\n<p>If you own PICO-8, you can run the cartridge ending with .p8.png (or the source code ending with .p8) directly with the pico8 executable.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, just download the binary executable for your PC platform, and run it.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Mouse click on Togglable element (green, small eye icon in the center) to toggle it</p>\n<p>Mouse click on Restart icon to restart level</p>\n<p>Keyboard press X/V/M to start emitting letters</p>\n<p>(Debug) Press Arrow Left/Right to go to previous/next level<br/></p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>To reorder letters, the player must mess up the travel time of some letters by interacting with the environment.<br/></p>\n<p>A given word is decomposed in letters that are sent at regular intervals from an emitting antenna. A letter travels in straight line until it reaches an element that affects its trajectory. The player can enable and disable those elements in order to guide the letters into a certain direction.</p>\n<p>Letters eventually arrive on a receiving antenna to compound a word again. Some trajectories being longer than others, letters are effectively reordered by the timely toggling of interactive elements, causing a new word to be created.</p>\r\nContent\r\n<p>The game consists of 4 levels defined by:</p>\n<ul><li>a tilemap containing elements that affect the letters\u2019 motion, some fixed and some that can be toggled</li><li>an initial word sent</li><li>a goal word that the player must recompose by reordering the letters</li></ul>\r\nSpecial tiles\r\n<p>Arrow: changes the direction of a traveling letter. Has a togglable variant.<br/></p>\n<p>Mirror: reflects direction of a traveling letter. Has a togglable variant.<br/></p>\n<p>Emitter: shaped as an antenna, it sends the original word, letter by letter</p>\n<p>Receiver: shaped as a circle (parabola seen from above), it receives the final word, letter by letter.<br/></p>\r\nContext\r\n<p>I made this game for the Global Game Jam 2018 on theme <em>Transmission</em>. As all the jam sites around me were already full, I took part in the event unofficially and the game is not registered on the GGJ website. I also wanted to start making games with PICO-8 (which uses Lua) so I thought it was a good opportunity to try the fantasy console.</p>Video<p>Since the game is very short, I would not recommend watching the walkthrough before playing. I've still made a video for promotional purpose, and also in case:</p><p>- you don't understand the controls and want to see how to play (only watch the first levels)<br/></p><p>- you have finished the game and want to check some alternative solutions<br/></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T07:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc8/bc8356fbb34f327ce3ba3e52f41bb990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["komehara"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
