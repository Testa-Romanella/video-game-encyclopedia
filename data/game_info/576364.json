{"id": 576364, "slug": "swing-miss", "name": "Swing & Miss", "name_original": "Swing & Miss", "description": "<p>Swing &amp; Miss is an adult visual novel, or eroge. It is a mostly linear story centered around themes such as swinging, netorare (or netorase), moral degeneration, and female domination. It contains a lengthy story and beautiful artwork to illustrate the characters and (erotic) event scenes.<br />\nThe story centers around the protagonist (you) and your wife Fiona. The two of you have been married for over a decade and get along perfectly. You know you&#39;re blessed to have a wife like Fiona, but you can&#39;t help but wish you had a more active sex life with her...<br />\nMeanwhile your new co-worker Davis is struggling with a similar issue: although frequency is not their problem, him and his new wife Kyleigh both want to take the lead in the bedroom. Davis comes to you with the obvious solution: if the two of you just swap wives, there&#39;s two perfect sexual matches instead of two mismatches...<br />\nThe characters the story focuses on are your wife Fiona, your co-worker Davis, and his wife Kyleigh. You will read most of the story from the protagonist&#39;s (the player can decide his name) perspective, but later in the game there&#39;s plenty of scenes from Fiona&#39;s perspective as well. At the start of the game you can decide whether you want to read the scenes from your wife&#39;s perspective as well, or would rather fully immerse yourself into the protagonist and read his scenes only.<br />\nFiona is a woman in her mid-thirties and the protagonist&#39;s wife. She was raised conservatively and taught not to talk about things like sex. She&#39;s kind and an amazing cook.<br />\nAs the story progresses she will open up about sex and be less embarrassed about the subject or the initiation of act itself. The question is until what point this is still a positive development...<br />\nKyleigh is the protagonist&#39;s co-worker&#39;s newlywed wife and the protagonist&#39;s partner in the swapping arrangement. She&#39;s assertive and easy-going, and works in fashion.<br />\nShe&#39;s very open sexually and seems to know no shame. She&#39;s dominant by nature, a trait which emerges more and more as the protagonist spends more time with her in the bedroom...<br />\nDavis is the protagonist&#39;s co-worker and his subordinate. He&#39;s young and permanently cheerful.<br />\nHe loves his wife very much, but is also very interested in the protagonist&#39;s wife. He appears to have the best intentions at first, but may have ulterior motives...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-06T15:17:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a2c/a2c1f163e083c3031951dea53934a09f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Infidelisoft"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Infidelisoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
