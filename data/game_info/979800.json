But there are some problems with that.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>First of all, \"FROG\" is a bit of a quirky guy.<br/><br/>FROG, a jumping ax master, has a body that can only jump.<br/>If you press the left/right buttons, you go down that direction and attack,<br/>At this time, if you have no enemies, You hit the floor and jump forward.<br/>However, there is a limit to climbing too steep a terrain, so be careful.<br/>This alone can solve everything from moving/attacking/avoiding.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Next, the background is in the middle of the sea.<br/><br/>Of course, frogs hate seawater so much that it is very dangerous.<br/>Some seafood that live in the sea there are very deadly to frogs.<br/>Sea pigeons are especially dangerous, so it's better to deal with them before you wake up.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Lastly, there is a HEAD GIRl flying around who has to break the head.<br/><br/>So the FROG goes after him in a lot of trouble, but the HEAD GIRl runs away easily.<br/>I think it's probably flying around using bubble gum, but I don't know the exact principle.<br/>It may seem cowardly, but she has to understand this because she only has a head.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The bottom line is to fight hard and catch a HEAD GIRl who will bring WOLWOLSOON.<br/>But then it looks too hard, so let me give you a tip.<br/><br/><br/>With his long practice, the FROG learned \"PANG JUMP\" to jump anywhere.<br/>It can also avoid attacks from seafood and jump on water or foam.<br/>And you can climb steep terrain that is difficult to climb.<br/>Pang jump is difficult because you have to press your foot just before it hits the target<br/>But if you learn this well, you can split the HEAD GIRl at once and get WOLWOLSOON.<br/><br/>Then shall we go split the head?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T06:51:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a42/a42952479d7e5979c975cdea9cba6fe1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["norazuma"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["norazuma"], "esrb_rating": null}
