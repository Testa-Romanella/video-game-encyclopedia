Adventurers sometimes kill your imps!</p>\n\n<p>This was made in just under 3 hours in one sitting for the Friday Night Game jam #2020-35</p>\n<p>This is my first 3 hour game jam, not really happy with the result, but it was fun to try. If I do another one of these i'm going to focus on trying to come up with something more unique instead of spending all my time\u00a0making basic tower defence mechanics that barely work haha.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a73/a73c953f9551ae1df9d4f022300bcb11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ASaunders"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
