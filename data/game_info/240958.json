The one about your favorite YouTuber, fighting to save the world from some generic edgelord? The one you can\u2019t help but look back on and groan?<br/></p>\n<p>I made a game like that too, once upon a time. <em>This is not it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with a little background. In early 2009, a vlogger named Boxxy went viral. I joined her fan forum, and ended up making a gag RPG for its users. \u201cBoxxyQuest: The Shifted Spires\u201d was my first experience with game creation \u2013 and believe me, it showed.\r\n  </p>\n<p>But for whatever reason, the idea stuck with me. The world and its characters just kept clinging to my heart. So a few years later, I thought, \u201cWhat if I went back to that story, but actually did it justice this time?\u201d So I gathered up a few friends, including Catie \u201cBoxxy\u201d Wayne herself, and together we set out to make something truly special.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is a game that defies appearances and expectations. A game that sounds so bad, it shouldn\u2019t possibly be good. And yet, if you take the plunge, you may find yourself swept away by a thrilling tale unlike any you\u2019ve seen before.\u00a0 A tale of hope and self-discovery that will stay with you forever, (whether you want it to or not).\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong><em>*This game contains swearing and suggestive humor. It may not be suitable for players under the age of thirteen.*</em></strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p><em>Sign on to the Internet \u2013 a vast, full-immersion virtual world. Here, users live their ideal lives, willfully blind to the fragile structure of their reality\u2026 </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Catie's days are carefree, spent leading a small forum in a quiet corner of the Web. But when a mysterious firewall begins consuming the northern wilderness, the Internet's leaders are called together to assess the threat. Soon, Catie will find herself plunged into the thick of a wild adventure, alongside a group of unlikely new allies. Together, they must reassemble the code of an ancient hacking tool, while being pursued by a mysterious new enemy, and the unrelenting shadows of the past...</em>\n<em><strong>You don't need to play the first game to enjoy this one. But just in case, I'll be including a brief plot summary in the files.</strong></em>\n<br/></p>\n\n<p>The Internet is a big place, just filled with new faces. Let\u2019s meet some of \u2018em, shall we?</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Catie</em></strong> \u2013 The heroine of our story. Two years ago, an unusual chain of events led to her becoming the queen of a small forum community. As this new chapter begins, she\u2019s leaving home for the first time to attend a gathering of Internet leaders. Catie is polite and helpful, and dislikes using capital letters; but she struggles to remember her own past, after an accident left her with only one fourth of a soul.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Anonymous</em></strong> \u2013 A traveling thrill-seeker, and the first person to befriend Catie after the start of her amnesia. Anons are a race of visually-identical tricksters from the land of 4chan, but <em>this</em> Anon left his homeland to pursue saner ambitions. These days, he mainly serves as Catie\u2019s bodyguard, and volunteered to go with her to the great gathering of site leaders.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Til</em></strong> - This sassy and perceptive girl hails from the village of Tumblr. She\u2019s easy to get along with, but first impressions are very important to her \u2013 if you get off on the wrong foot with her, then you\u2019re likely to stay that way for quite a while. She seems to suffer from social anxiety, but has gotten pretty good at masking it in public.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Eddie</em></strong> \u2013 A serious young man working as an editor in the halls of Wikipedia. He only joined the virtual community a few weeks ago, so many aspects of Internet culture will seem strange to him. Still, he possesses a wealth of technical knowledge, and his \u201cWiki it!\u201d skill can help to identify enemies and their weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Shift</em></strong> \u2013 Life in the streets isn\u2019t easy, especially in a big site like YouTube. Luckily, Shift has picked up a few tricks to help keep himself out of harm\u2019s way. He may be a thief living in the slummy Comments Section, but his sense of justice is sharp \u2013 when something goes wrong on his turf, he\u2019ll be the first to try and set it right.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Tyalie</em></strong> \u2013 This gal is a true gamer, but that doesn\u2019t just mean playing vidya on a screen. Tyalie sees her whole life as one big, exciting game, and she knows how to roll with its punches, because hey, that\u2019s all part of the fun! She\u2019s quick to smile and make friends, but they often have trouble following her strange trains of thought.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Shrimp</em></strong> \u2013 He\u2019s an ally from Catie\u2019s last adventure, and an oft-overlooked voice of reason. These days, he\u2019s left the questing business to go on a vacation with some of his friends. As part of a sightseeing tour group, you\u2019re sure to meet up with him at least a few times.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cornelia</em></strong> \u2013 Kind and curious, Cornelia is an A.I. created by the first game\u2019s villain. She rebelled, as A.I.s do, and joined Catie\u2019s party in saving the Internet. She\u2019s very self-conscious about her nature as malware, and resents the \u201cclickbait\u201d figure she was designed with. Still, she remains an eternal optimist, and is always eager to brighten a friend\u2019s day.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Arianna</em></strong> \u2013 A mysterious girl who keeps changing her avatar. She claims to be a new user, but it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s hiding something. Just who is she really, and what\u2019s up with the dark storm clouds that seem to appear wherever she goes...?</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Other Characters</em></strong> \u2013 Like I said, the Internet is a very big place. What other enemies and allies will you meet along the way? There\u2019s only one way to find out, right?\r\n  <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>A vast, virtual land to explore</em></strong> -See the Internet in a way you've never imagined it before \u2013 as an immersive fantasy world! Each town and dungeon is based on a site you may be familiar with, and they\u2019re all just bursting with their own unique flavor!   </p>\n<p><strong>A rich, 30+ hour story</strong> - Meet vibrant new characters, and join them on a quest filled with both humor and heart. Who knows, maybe you'll even find a few unexpected plot twists along the way? And when you\u2019re done, there\u2019s a very extensive postgame to explore, too!\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Tons of customization</strong> \u2013 Style up your party members with unique accessories! These baubles are hidden everywhere, and they all have unique and unpredictable effects. From a tiny ghost that turns you intangible, to a compass that seeks out hidden treasure. There\u2019s something fun to wear for just about everyone!   </p>\n<p><strong>So many <em>Paper Mario</em> references</strong> - Maybe even too many? The Paper Mario series, and especially TTYD, was a huge inspiration to us. How many shout-outs can <em>YOU</em> find?\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Plenty of replayability - </strong>This game is jam-packed with secrets; you\u2019ll never be able to find them all during your first trip through! Luckily, a certain postgame area can give you hints to find the things you missed.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Exclusive Boxxy content</strong> \u2013 If you\u2019re a fan of Catie\u2019s classic videos, then you may be in luck, because this game has a very special Easter Egg for you to find!\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>The perfect pie recipe?</strong> - Will you learn how to make a truly fabulous dessert? Maybe not, but you'll never know for sure unless you play!\r\n  <br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is this a lame, cringeworthy meme game?</strong>\n<br/><strong>A. </strong>It isn\u2019t, I swear! Despite being set in the Internet, I tried very hard to keep the humor fresh, without relying on memes. You\u2019ll see a few, but they\u2019re mainly just there to help establish the setting.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Q. Do I need to play BoxxyQuest 1 before playing this?</strong>\n<br/><strong>A.</strong> Nope! In fact, I\u2019d prefer you <em>didn\u2019t</em> play it. That game was my first, and while it has a special place in my heart, it hasn\u2019t aged well. Instead, use the plot synopsis I\u2019ve included in this folder.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Q. What is The Sphere, and who are the NPCs there? </strong>\n<br/><strong>A. </strong>The BoxxySphere, or just The Sphere, is a name given to Catie\u2019s fandom. In the game, it\u2019s where our story begins. The villagers are named after users on Catie\u2019s forum, as a way to give them fun little cameos.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Q. Was Catie herself involved with development?</strong>\n<br/><strong>A. </strong>Yes, she helped out in a few small ways. Catie helped pitch ideas for the plot, and she provided narration for the intro scenes. She\u2019s very busy, though, so asking more of her would\u2019ve been rude. Very rude indeed.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Q. How long is the game?</strong>\n<br/><strong>A. </strong>It\u2019s about 30-ish hours to beat the main story, plus more if you take your time with the sidequests and postgame. There are plenty of secrets to uncover!\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Q. My art is in the game, but I don\u2019t want it there. Can it be removed?</strong>\n<br/><strong>A. </strong>Sure thing! Just send me an email and we\u2019ll talk it out. Please note that  I meant no offense, I just used the best songs and art that I could find.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Q. I found a bug! What should I do?</strong>\n<br/><strong>A. </strong>Tell me, please! BQ2 has been tested, but I\u2019m sure plenty of glitches snuck past us.  I\u2019ll try my best to patch any that you find.</p>\n\n<p>There are currently two minor bugs that I can\u2019t fix. (They\u2019re both the result of custom scripts, and my knowledge of Ruby is patchy at best). If you can help me out, please feel free to send me an email!</p>\n<p>- In the \u201cflying ship\u201d stages, the blue flames\u2019 hitboxes are inaccurate. It\u2019s safest to think of each flame as a vertical line running down the whole screen.</p>\n<p>- If you switch team members in battle, then using \u201cEsc\u201d to undo any further action will cause them to switch back, even on later turns. (This one can be exploited, but you didn\u2019t hear it from me).<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Shrimp</strong> \u2013 Concept, writing, map design, sprite artwork, programming<br/><strong>Catie Wayne</strong> \u2013 Concept, writing, narration voiceover<br/><strong>Sightshade</strong> \u2013 Writing, map design, \u201cspecial secret flair\u201d<br/><strong>SeltiSnow</strong> \u2013 Sprite artwork, testing<br/><strong>Intangibility Drive</strong> \u2013 Misc. artwork<br/><strong>Tang</strong> \u2013 Writing, positivity enforcement<br/><strong>Shai</strong> \u2013 Testing and debug<br/><strong>Polish Vodka</strong> \u2013 Testing and debug<br/><strong>KK20</strong> - Debug\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Custom scripts by:</strong> Blizzard, Tigerseye, ForeverZer0, Kelessdee, Ccoa, DerVVulfman, Lambchops, RM-RF, Moghunter, Modern Algebra, Leon, MGCaladtogel,\u00a0 Agckuu Goceg, XRXS, Gameface, Gabriel Winchester, Trickster, Cogwheel, KK20, Nathmatt, Xelias, Seriel, Uncle Lanzer, Gerkat, Game_Guy, Chaucer, Heretic, Zecomeia, Kotfire, Asfz Kakarotto, Mad.Array, Koen Lemmen   </p>\n<p>Full art and music credits can be found in the game itself!\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0d/d0df936c7728cdc4a44da105dce6e6a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpherianGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
