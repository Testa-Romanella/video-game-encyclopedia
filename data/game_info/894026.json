While an arkanoid clone, the plot, characters and dialogue are all wierd and strange and surreal and cringy. There is certainly some enjoyment that can be garnered from that, but I am not especially proud of it today! I wish I could say this game came from a teenager's imagination, but I had already turned 20 when it was made!\r\n</p>\n<p>Since you are not the embarrassed author, you might happen to enjoy it far more. A lot of random furry characters have been pulled from various places and used in the game, and while I did get permission from all their owners, they did not sign any kind of terms and conditions about what I was allowed to do with them, nor did they provide me any details about who the characters are, so unfortunately, most of the borrowed characters in this game are completely misportrayed compared to their canon appearances; not that that will have much significance to a stranger who is not familiar with danish furry communities of the late 2010's. (which I bet are most of the people who will ever find themselves on this page.)</p>\n<p>This \"Enhancement\" edition fixes a few bugs and adds a much clearer font, as the 1.0 version's font was nearly unreadable! However, the storyline, mechanics, etc. are exactly the same.</p>\n<p>It uses mouse controls. I also recommend turning on the autosave feature immediately.</p>\n<p>The cover art was drawn by Sinnocturnal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T11:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/6775f32b29103d11616cc4a8cf1c8cf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Spring Spring"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
