There are 10 levels to complete. Touching a die will add a random modifier to the player. These modifiers will change your speed, jump height or size. You can only have one modifier at a time. You will need to use the dice to your advantage.</p>\n<p><em>Please Note: There are a few glitches but that is to be expected when making a game in 48 hours.</em></p>\n\r\nKeyboard Controls\r\n<p><strong>Player 1:</strong>\n</p>\r\nMove Left: Left Arrow<br/>\r\nMove Right: Right Arrow<br/>\r\nJump: Up Arrow\r\n<p><strong>Player 2:</strong>\n</p>\r\n2 Player mode is broken and I didn't have time to fix it.<br/>(Player 2 is controlled via a gamepad)<br/>The screen will split into 2\r\n<p><strong>Restart:\u00a0</strong>Space Key</p>\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>Created by Daniel Lee\r\n</p>\n<p>Developed for the\u00a0\"GMTK 2022\" game jam</p>\n<p>Theme: Roll of The Dice (16/Jul - 18/Jul)</p>\n<p>Developed with Unity for my second game jam.
