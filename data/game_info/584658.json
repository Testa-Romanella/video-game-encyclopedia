This is our submission for the 77th Mini Jam. If I'm being honest it plays terribly right now, but we will <strong>fix</strong> this in a future update <strong>coming very soon</strong>. The reason for the rushed game is complicated. Long story short, two people left and two people came in to fill in their place on the last day. Anyway, here's a VERY rough draft of the game with a very bad chart to go with it that broke during building :(<br/><br/>NOTE: very jank, credits button doesn't work yet either. stay tuned im too tired cya tommorow.<br/><br/>4/6/21 (More Than a Sapling Update):<br/>Hey all, I'm back after a while. Took a break for a day then hopped back on the project. The game's UI has been <strong>significantly improved\u00a0</strong><strong>and the chart for the song has been kinda fixed.\u00a0</strong>Don't worry, I'm working on finishing the chart as soon as possible so all of you can play. Thanks to everyone who's stuck with us through the rough launch!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T05:17:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fa/9fa6df9a4f2c6d6ae06f040a1f3e7dfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["colorplease"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
