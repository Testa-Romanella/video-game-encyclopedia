Escape the inferno with one of multiple escape pods. It seems to be an impossible task, but you will leave the planet or die trying.</p>\n<p><strong>-- Gameplay --</strong></p>\n<p>You will die... a lot!</p>\n<p>Evac is a vertical endless runner where you navigate an escape pod between different platforms using short burst of the ships thruster. Every burst\u00a0drains energy from the ships battery.<br/>Get your escape pod as far as possible without falling of the screens or running out of energy. Standing on a platform for to long or crashing into an EMP-Mine will also drain your energy quickly. Collecting power-cells will refill your batteries and help you escape the inferno or at least reach a good position the leaderboard of all dead captains.</p>\n<p><strong>-- Upgrades --</strong></p>\n<p>You earn credits with every run that you do. Increase the amount of credits by travel further and collect more cells.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spend your credits on upgrades to improve your pod and be able to reach better ranks in the\u00a0leaderboard of dead captains.</p>\n<p><strong>-- Controls --</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Jump: Left mouse /\u00a0Space</li><li>Charge Jump:\u00a0Hold Left mouse /\u00a0Space</li><li>Move/Roll:\u00a0A /\u00a0D or Left /\u00a0Right (works also in mid-air)</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>This is work in progress.
