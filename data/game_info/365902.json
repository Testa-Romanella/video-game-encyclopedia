As such, the program will freeze for a few seconds as it generates the texture. Please wait for it to load.</p><p>-note, on chrome it seems to take nearly 20 seconds to generate the graphic, but on firefox it was only like 4 seconds. I've added a texture size slider to help reduce the default computation times.</p>\n<p>The \"sphere\"\u00a0is actually a rounded cube. I don't understand sphere UV mapping, and didn't enjoy the crunch at the poles. Projecting the texture onto a cube means that all of the texture is slightly scrombled, instead of a bit of it being massively scrombled.</p>\n<p>The noise texture projected onto the \"sphere\" is a cube cut out of the combined 3D noise map.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys lets you move the camera around the world. The \"enter\" key\u00a0stops/starts the autospin.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T09:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3cab4fa7ce8feb724ba7281f5d368557.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["notapplicable"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
