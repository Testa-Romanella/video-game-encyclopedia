At your disposal is the very simple mechanic of sticking to walls and ceilings, no complex control schemes or wonky physics, so how hard can it be?<br/><br/>Whilst the only way forward is up, the way up isn't always obvious. The level contains multiple routes, and for those technically gifted players you will likely be able to find skips around obstacles entirely. Be careful however, because once you fall and are unable to find your footing on the platforms below you, the only way back up is the very same path you came...<br/><br/>But it's simple really, just jump and stick it.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li> Tight and satisfying controls, Stick to walls and ceilings by dashing<br/></li><li> Hard to master, whilst sticking to surfaces might seem simple, there's a hidden mechanic to it that will allow you to find new paths.<br/></li><li> A massive level, many many hours to beat it, if you're even able to.<br/></li><li> Non-linear level, there's almost always more than one way up, which one will suit you?
