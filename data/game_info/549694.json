You used to serve on ship Kingfisher and you went through many wild\u00a0adventures. But life of the sailor is dangerous one. That's why you've\u00a0decided to go for the one last adventure to make a fortune. Unfortunately, the Kingfisher was sunk. Before captain went down with his ship, he told you about secret treasure. This might be you lucky chance. Grab the shovel and start to dig!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD / Arrows - Sailor and Boat movement</p>\n<p>Q - Enter / Leave boat</p>\n<p>E - Pick items</p>\n<p>Space - Dig</p>\n<p><strong>Development</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The story around this Trijam entry is also bit wild. For this weekend, I was preparing myself for other game jam, the Global Game Jam. Long story short, I've underestimated team work and time frame and I've ended up with no entry to deliver. Since I've screwed up so horribly, I've decided to atleast deliver another small game for Trijam. Funny enough, this game idea kinda fits both themes: Trijam: Islands and GGJ:\u00a0Lost and Found. Although it's weird game, I enjoyed it and I hoped you will enjoy it as well. I'm looking forward to play your entries.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T02:49:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/655/6552e6bfd5e445268f8f71940e8c3667.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wandering_GameDev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
