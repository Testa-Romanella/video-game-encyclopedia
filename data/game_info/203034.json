Look at a planet to target it, and hold click to get pulled in by it's gravity. Didn't have time for any win or fail states, so just have fun swinging around!</p><p>Look around with mouse. While looking directly at a planet, hold left mouse button to latch on and gravitate towards it. You can look away while attached to a planet; I'd recommend attaching to planets you're flying along side to get a good orbit.</p><p>Hold space bar to adjust sensitivity (there's a slider to the right of the text) and switch inversion of camera controls.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4e/b4ef9d12668aa43ccf5ba166f7a837f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FiniteZombie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
