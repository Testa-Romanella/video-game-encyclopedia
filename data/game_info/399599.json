And to a dragon, that means treasure! Search underground mazes and solve elaborate puzzles in your quest for gems, and see if you can hoard enough to impress the other dragons!</p>\n<p>A classic puzzle challenge, featuring over a hundred levels and many different objects including treasure chests, replicators, floating balloons, fire beams, thieving elves, conveyor belts, gravity switches, and many more! Between all these traps, the levels require a good mixture of reflex action and thoughtful planning; and the varied mechanics keep things interesting to solve.</p>\n<p>The puzzles are fair: no luck-based puzzles, no searching for walls you can walk through, and all time limits are optional. Finally, a powerful level editor lets you make your own levels and share them with your fellow dragons!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T02:48:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0a1e84c8d05f3f3cf102120a76249e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crystal Shard"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
