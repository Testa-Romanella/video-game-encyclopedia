To this end, each player has an individual and distinct voice-activated shooting style, some more suited to a particular enemy than others. The game encourages the players to understand how deploying their shooting style (or 'voice') effectively assists in overcoming a common enemy, but also how inappropriate use of their shooting style (or 'voice') can cause the situation to get worse and the enemy to become stronger.</p><p>The goal is to work with the other players to effectively develop a collaborative shooting strategy that best overcomes the enemy.</p><p>As the ambigram in out title screen suggests, noise and quiet are two sides of the same coin, but each can have very different impacts on a situation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/411/4112b4ce7671bb527c7e905cd3ba0d07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ij_lewis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
