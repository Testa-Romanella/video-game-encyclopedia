If you are in the UK and are age 10-18, please consider checking out this initiative!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nominated for the BAFTA YGD Game Making Award, this game used to be available via\u00a0the official website\u00a0but the download has since broken.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Illuminate is a platform game where you can't see the level and where you need to go. You must navigate each of the levels and reach the door at the end of each level. But if the level is shrouded in darkness, how will you be able to see where you are going?</em></p>\n<p>This game was made in 2016 by a 14-year-old me. I am currently uploading my older projects for use on my portfolio.</p>\r\nWarning:\r\n<p><em>\"Lightning\"</em>\u00a0mode may not be good for those who are sensitive to\u00a0<em>flashing lights and epilepsy</em>. I tried to make it as smooth and not as disorienting as possible, but I still advise caution<em>\u00a0(probably because I am over-worrying, but please stay safe, everyone)</em>. The third tutorial level shows this off, so if it is uncomfortable to play, please avoid those sections.</p>\r\nMusic credits:\r\n<ul><li>Unity - Light Mix Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Unity (120 bpm) (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Unity (140\u00a0bpm) Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Unity (160\u00a0bpm) Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T04:21:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39d77a21ec5a887d510808ba8f4f3b4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harry"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
