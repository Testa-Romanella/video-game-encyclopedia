{"id": 153758, "slug": "sopwith-itch", "name": "Sopwith (itch)", "name_original": "Sopwith (itch)", "description": "<p>Sopwith is a side scrolling shoot'em up created by David L. Clark of BMB Compuscience in 1984. It was originally written to run on the IBM PC under DOS but there was also a port made near the time of its creation for the Atari 520ST. The game involves piloting a Sopwith biplane, attempting to bomb enemy buildings while avoiding fire from enemy planes and various other obstacles.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (they are crappy setup but let me test without taking hand off of keyboard for tests in Unity)</strong><br/>W / S: Pitch of airplane (how you make it do loops)<br/>A / D: Throttle<br/>Space: Machine gun<br/>F: Bombs<br/>E: Roll<br/>R: Reset orientation back to neutral. Also costs 25 points to do this, so earn some points first.<br/>G: Reset game</p>\n<p>This version has some modifications over my old 'infinite runner' version. This is more true to the original game in that it has a limited level. It also allows the aircraft to roll for going the opposite direction on start.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c9c3fc62bb32a8ee61fc038dcbc15fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Salty Sea Dogs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
