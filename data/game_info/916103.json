{"id": 916103, "slug": "a-little-journey-phyrex", "name": "A Little Journey (Phyrex)", "name_original": "A Little Journey (Phyrex)", "description": "<p>This game is an adaptation of the Ray Bradbury short story A Little Journey, published in 1951. The original story is very brief, only about 2,500 words, so I took some liberties filling in details and expanding the story a bit. The result is that any individual playthrough should still be paced about the same as the original, and take about as long, but there's room to explore other perspectives and slightly alter events to influence the ending.</p><p>Hope you have fun! If you decide to play through multiple times, don't refresh the page. You'll be circled back around and a few things might be different your second time through.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T13:52:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67b/67b62c534c249593be470e5f24d512fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phyrex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
