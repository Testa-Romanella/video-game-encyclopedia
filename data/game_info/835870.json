I wanted to make a simple project that used all the different basic mechanics of a game engine, such as collision, UI, audio, particles, audio, etc. The game also utilises low-resolution rendering, hopefully adding to the 'arcadey' feel.</p>\n<p>The game is by no means an original idea. It is just an asteroid-clone. I was not thinking about originality, instead just wanted to practice using a new game development tool. I added a few little things such as a laser sight and a ship trail, but nothing drastic.</p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<p>Fly around and dodge asteroids. Shoot them to break them apart.</p>\n<p>'W' to move forwards. 'S' to brake. 'A' &amp; 'D' to rotate.</p>\n<p>'Click' or 'Space' to shoot.</p>\n<p>The colour of the players bullets and the colour of the ships trail can be changed in the options.</p>\n<p>You rotate faster when moving forwards. You can rotate slower, if stationary, by holding shift.</p>\n<p>The player gun has a cooldown, of which the display can be toggled in the options.</p>\n<p>The laser sight can also be toggled in the options, or the colour can be changed.</p>\n<p>The game gradually gets more difficult, with asteroids spawning quicker.</p>\n<p>The difficulty bar and timer can be toggled in settings.</p>\n<p>While you can get away with staying still in the early game, you must move around to dodge asteroids in the later game.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Programming, Art, SFX, &amp; Music - Me</p>\n<p>SFX made using bfxr by increpare</p>\n<p>Music made using BoscaCeoil by Terry Cavanagh</p>\n<p>'Game Over' SFX - \"Game Over Arcade\" by myfox14 on freesound.org</p>\n<p>Game Font - \"Pixelmix Font\" by Andrew Tyler on fontspace.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:39:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/7039dd13ec50bb855c0f936c9fc25d55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Zombee0804"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
