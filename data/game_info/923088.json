At first, the dimensional shifts between both worlds were fascinating slow transitions, where the two living species could see and learn about each other. As it became more frequent, both came to realize that one dimension would inevitably be absorbed by the other. To survive, one must eliminate any vital energy from the rival dimension.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Netherverse, Humans and Nethers face each other in a 6-minutes quick deathmatch. One team starts as the Hunters and must takedown the opposing team members as many times as possible while they run away.
