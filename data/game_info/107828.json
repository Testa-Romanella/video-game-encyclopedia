She drew most of the pictures over the course of the week and told me what they were (FACES, NOTES, MIRRORS, SNOWMEN). When I asked what the game was about, she said it was about \"how we are a band\" and her only request was to do the music and sound. We worked together on some pictures - I used red, yellow, and blue for everything I made. She scored the game in one take using a Casiotone MT-68 keyboard; I made some small cuts and added some events to match her sound effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4c/a4c0d09553e77a1dc71625bd743d5f7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KYLE REIMERGARTIN"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
