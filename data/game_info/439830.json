Experience Tev's advendture, as he sneaks into the Wizard's Maze to steal the legendary Jewl of Triviality.</em></p>\n<p><em>Different to most platformers, Tev doesn't use a weapon. Instead, Tev found a Necklace on entering the maze, that allows him to turn the rooms he's in.</em></p>\n<p><em>Help Tev make his way through the maze and steal as many treasures as you can.</em></p>\n<p><em>But be careful, the Wizard set up traps all over the maze...</em></p>\n<p><strong>I have uploaded a first demo of \"the Wizard's Maze\".\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please let me know what you think of the game in general, the concept, the art, the controls, the music in the comments. I'm thankful for every feedback that helps me make a better game and to learn a lot along the way.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is an entry for the \"No Excuse Game Jam\" and the first time I've ever tried my hand on creating a game - or programming in general for that matter.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The game is by no means finished</strong> but I wanted to get a version out there to see what people think.</p>\n<p>The level is just different layout experiments at the moment. It should be beatable but I think right now it's pretty damn hard (please don't hate me).</p>\n<p>Also: I have no way of testing the Mac\u00a0OSX version, so if something's wrong just let me know.</p>\n<p>The music and sprites are still under development. Feedback on both is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>I've also implemented Joypad input to control the character.\u00a0 Unfortunately I haven't figured out how to navigate the menu using a Joycon, so at the moment you still need your Mouse to click the menu options.\u00a0</p><p><strong>The Joypad mapping is as follows:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>D-Pad left / right: Move left / right</li><li>X-Box A (Nintendo B): Jump</li><li>Left and right shoulder button (L1, R1): Rotate the room by 90\u00b0 left / right</li><li>Start: Open Menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>For Keyboard control:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>left / right arrow: Move left / right</li><li>Space:\u00a0Jump</li><li>\"E\" / \"R\": Rotate the room by 90\u00b0 left / right</li><li>Escape: Open Menu</li></ul>\n<p>I created the game using Godot. The sprites are drawn in Aseprite and the music composed in Bosca Ceoil. The font is called Silkscreen (License).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:57:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a29ad091daa53c3c1aeb026617293f6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["forstjes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
