Use movement and physics to your advantage, outwit your enemy from every angle, you'll never look at a shooter the same way again.<h3>TRUE FREEDOM</h3>Movement in Midair is an art. It's a flow. It's a learned, practiced skill that when you know it\u2026 you just feel it. Using your jetpack and frictionless boots, launch high-speed airborne assaults, expertly dodge enemy fire, and soar from hilltop to hilltop. Free yourself from the ground or become a quick frag for your opponent. The jetpack draws from your armor\u2019s energy pool, so strategically manage your use of the jetpack and weapons to ensure your battle advantage. Depending on the situation, adjust your jetpack from pushing you upward to giving more maneuvering power. Veteran players know how to manage their jets and energy by instinct.<h3>TEAMWORK IS CRITICAL</h3>A team without coordination is like a shooter without jetpacks. In Midair it's critical that you coordinate your assaults for maximum effect. Take down their flag defenses one by one to expose their flag for a quick grab. But remember, you'll need to keep your flag home too. Enemies who have spent hours studying the terrain and perfecting their movement will race in, grab your flag, and get out -- and FAST. With the right team and friends you can depend on, this will be a breeze.<br/><br/><br/>Get ready for a new experience in a shooter with a lot to offer. Suit up. Jets on. Fly free. We'll see you in Midair: Community Edition.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T12:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd4/cd4e65641aabd9e51d12fc661af06fcd.jpg", "website": "https://midair.gg", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Midair Community", "Archetype"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Archetype"], "esrb_rating": null}
