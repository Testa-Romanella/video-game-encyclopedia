Bend the laws of physics to your whims, or just punch things until they do what you want. You can be creative, you can be unhinged, or you can challenge yourself to find the optimal solution!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Pick the right tool for the job</h3>Keep it simple with bounce pads, get ready for ultraviolence with a punching glove hooked up to a spring, slap a few industrial fans in there or just make gravity go up and a bit to the side, and more! Every challenge is a blank canvas!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Lava, portals, black holes, oh my!</h3>There will be plenty of obstacles that keep you from victory, so improvise, adapt, and overcome. Perhaps, if you are clever enough, you can even use them to your advantage...<br/><br/><br/><h3>A huge spread of challenges to overcome... or create</h3>From calm forests to decrepit post-apocalypses, there are 80+ puzzles to solve! You can also create and share your own custom levels, and play levels made by others!<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T09:30:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4c/d4cfa643b07d4bc1391fda71290ca328.jpg", "website": "https://www.tuonele.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tuonele"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Tuonele"], "esrb_rating": null}
