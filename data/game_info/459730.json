What Touki was not expecting was to converge paths with Saya, his childhood friend from a few years ago, who he hadn\u2019t talked to since a certain incident.</p>\n<p>To make matters more complicated, a mysterious transfer student arrives shortly after. She seems to loathe him immediately and Touki feels that he has met her somewhere before.</p>\n<p>Within the chaos of the present and the mystery of the past that is chasing him, there is uncertainty in the air as he forges a path towards his future and his desire to connect with others.</p>\n<p><strong>Characters</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kusunose Saya: </strong>Touki's childhood friend. They attend the same school and are both second-year students, however, Saya is in a different class. As with him, she moved from the countryside and is now in Tokyo. She acts on her emotions and likes to do things at her own pace.</p>\n<p><strong>Komari Ayumi:\u00a0</strong>Ayumi is Touki\u2019s senpai and the student council president of Ainoshima Gakuen. Gentle and good at taking care of others, she is the perfect onee-san. Perhaps it is because of her maternal instincts, that she will often accept people's requests for advice. Being very popular among the students, she has both male and female supporters.</p>\n<p><strong>Yamabuki Kuon: </strong>Kuon is in her first year in high school and is Touki\u2019s kouhai. A cute and lively underclassman, she honestly expresses what she feels. She loves and admires Ayumi, to the point where she follows her around at every opportunity that arises. Kuon is pretty silly and weird at times and happens to love cute things. During her free time, she helps out at her mother's caf\u00e9.\r\n</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<ul><li>Total Play Time: 25-30 hours</li><li>Branching story arcs and multiple endings depending on your choices.</li><li>Unexpected and surprising plot points that will keep you reading until the very end.</li><li>Unique characters</li><li>40 - 50 CG art with High-quality artwork</li><li>CG Gallery | Music Gallery</li><li>Camera Mode</li></ul>\n<p><strong>SUPPORT US:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Even if you can't support us, you could contribute by helping us spread the word!
