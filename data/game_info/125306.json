For that, you need to survive as much as you can. Of course you'll need to feast on some souls.

The hellhounds especially didn't forget about the deal and they are itching to taste some bone.</p>\n<p>WebGL version:\u00a0https://developer.cloud.unity3...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6c/f6cf035efd14b78682fa702142f36f84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameJamMegaTeam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
