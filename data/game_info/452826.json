They also give opportunity to some good students hiring them as interns. Their goal is to achieve the knowledge of manipulating <strong>'wormholes'</strong> and <strong>'portals'</strong> between distant spaces. Also they love rockets, jet-engines and shuttles. They're more like a \u201cSpace\" company which invests a lot on new technologies.<br/></p>\n<p>There he is... Our intern who work and learn about quantum physics and other boring stuff... No ops I'm sorry. Anyway... Here at <strong>Gravity Industries</strong> our dear <strong>JetBoy </strong>got the luck of working at the same Lab section as <strong>Layla</strong>, which is his true love.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Layla is working at the lab with some high tech stuff and one of her experiments is a gravitational portal which our dear JetBoy is involved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When JetBoy appeared in the lab (<em>breaking something and making some awkward face ahh...</em>) his lovely girl Layla was working on that very hard (<em>I mean boring... ya now</em>) experiment. She is a genius! Different from our JetBoy...</p>\n<p>Continuing to breaking some stuff and being awkward, JetBoy (<em>sorry about that too...</em>) his lovely girl just figured out <strong>how to open the portal!</strong> How awesome is that? But she still don't know how to make it stable. So they need to reach other places <strong>phisically </strong>through a new <strong>Jet-pack</strong> which are still in development. Also they need to use an intern as volunteer to make the \"test\" <em>(That's the part when everything become interesting).</em></p>\n<p>Everybody look and point to our poor (<em>and clumsy btw</em>) JetBoy. But (<em>of course</em>) he doesn't want to use the Jet-pack... So JetBoy <strong>'W A N T E D'</strong> to be the volunteer and started the test.</p>\n<p>After a few hours <strong>he returned to the lab and couldn't find Layla! (OMG)</strong> Instead he just saw a portal closing and a strange creature in a place seeming like the <strong>MOON</strong>...</p>\n<p>Now our (<em>ungainly, gawky, unwieldy and blundering</em>) JetBoy don't know how to open the portal to go and save her... So he decided to reach the moon by using the Jet-pack!</p>\n<p>And he said: <em>\"I need to save her... Let's go!\"</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Tell us your feedback.</strong></em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:59:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/426f75578c6df49e779791fa4626dd1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["UU Soft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
