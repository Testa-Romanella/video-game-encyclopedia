The game contains 40 levels and is available on Windows, OSX and Linux. <br/><br/>Every level starts with the player character standing on the start tile. The start tile is perfectly safe-- No, trust me. It's safe. Once you leave the start tile, you have a limited time to reach the treasure before the level crushes you. To complicate things, each level will include a number of obstacles to waste your time and possibly kill you. You can make your own levels!FEATURES<br/><ul><li>40 challenging levels.</li></ul><ul><li>Blood and gore can be disabled.</li></ul><ul><li>Full gamepad support.</li></ul><ul><li>A full-featured level editor.</li></ul><ul><li>Custom levels support.</li></ul><ul><li>Supported languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Portuguese</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:47:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/037/037d5dfd14cd12d9d8dc9334a258059b.jpg", "website": "http://www.infinitrap.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 162}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shadebob Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shadebob Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
