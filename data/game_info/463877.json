This game\u00a0features a sword that can control your limited field of view to help you see the world around you, find orbs and of course, fight enemies.<br/></p>\n<p>This year's game jam theme was Out of Control and my game gets out of control in 2 main aspects. First, in this game the your field of view is limited to a small radius\u00a0around the sword in your hand. As the sword moves so does your view, and by tossing it out front you can see more of the environment. Subsequently, the enemy spawning quickly goes out of control as the rate at which they spawn can become very overwhelming.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing my game!\r\n</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Look around with your mouse.</p>\n<p>Use WASD or arrow keys to move.</p>\n<p>Left click to use your sword, and right click to throw out your sword like a boomerang.</p>\n<p>Your enemies are the bouncy balls. Use your sword to destroy them.</p>\n<p>Collect orbs to refill your health.</p>\n<p>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH6oMavk9a7g2Bt-8TTAttw/</p>\n<p>Discord: ZoeyZoella #4601</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4eb196874fd1013b12911fc17cbf1f31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zoey Zoella"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
