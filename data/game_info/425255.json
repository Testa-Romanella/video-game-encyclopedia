You can run it using either HyperCard proper or the HyperCard viewer in Mini vMac.</p>Playing the game without an emulator<p>At the moment, you can't. However, after the jam, I might make either a video or a web-based version using the assets I produced. This story is relevant to other games and stories that I'm developing, so <em>Fragments </em>is likely to make an appearance in non-HyperCard format sooner or later.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:09:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50b/50ba235c0052b55b8b678f4b398ea587.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amorphous"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
