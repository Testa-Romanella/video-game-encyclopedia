{"id": 610110, "slug": "quarantined-rbtrman", "name": "Quarantined (RBTRMan)", "name_original": "Quarantined (RBTRMan)", "description": "<p>Quarantined is a visual novel life simulator, with the purpose of spreading awareness on how a quarantine can affect the wellbeing of individuals and practices that can be utilized to combat these stressors. In Quarantined, players take control of Jenre, an introverted college student whose daily routines have been disrupted by the sudden announcement of an ECQ in Metro Manila. This plunges him into a new reality, where misinformation, demotivation, and isolation reign. As the pandemic continues and the uncertainty of it all begins to consume him, Jenre must find a way to cope with his \u201cNew Normal '' and rekindle the connections that he had lost before the pandemic began. Players will do various activities, such as chores, conversations, and work to maintain Jenre\u2019s wellbeing, while within the confines of the home. The game is by no means finished, however, this demo showcases the foundational concepts that we would want to implement. Ideally, we would want minigames to accompany each activity as well as lengthen the story to be more impactful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T11:05:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/896/896f7e11c23fff7a7542f180f69d7dc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RBTRMan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
