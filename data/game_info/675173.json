We wanted to focus on developing a game where the battles were simulated, but you would be responsible for managing your fellows (soldiers) between battles and deciding on strategic formations for battles.</p>\n<p>The project was really ambitious for a 3 day game jam, and so sadly the game is still not very well balanced or fully complete. However, you are still able to enjoy the current content, including:</p>\n<ul><li>Name and manage a fellowship of soldiers, who are set on bringing an end to an unbalanced king's rule</li><li>Generation of fellows with randomised faces and features, along with names submitted by the community<br/>\n</li><li>Manage the vital statistics of fellows, avoiding statistics drop too low and leading them to an early grave</li><li>Decide where your fellowship should rest and perform out of combat activities</li><li>Micromanage which fellows perform activities; such as hunting, healing allies and resting between battles</li><li>Decide which weapon each fellow uses in combat (sword, mace, polearm or bow) based on their individual characteristics</li><li>Allocate fellows to strategic blocks, which are given specific tactics for battle.</li><li>Decide on a battle formation for your fellowship's strategic blocks</li><li>Watch simulated battles with context specific commentary (tribute to Football Manager)</li><li>Visit villages to recruit new fellows to your fellowship</li><li>Do battle against the mad King's armies to grow in reputation</li><li>Take on the mad King at his castle to bring back stability to the lands\u00a0</li><li>Explore a hexagonal game board with vibrantly illustrated game art<br/>\n</li><li>3 original, fantastic, sounds tracks made for the game</li></ul>\n<p>There are still many bugs and balancing issues, but are really pleased with how far we got with a rather ambitiously scoped jam game. <br/><br/>Some notes to keep in mind the following bugs while\u00a0playing the game in its current state:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Please don't click buttons multiple times too fast</li><li>Try and close popups in the order of how recently they popped up, if possible</li><li>The gold mechanic wasn't fully implemented</li><li>You can still eat even if your food supply isn't high enough (fixed in 1.0.3)</li><li>ALT + F4 to quit</li></ul>\n<p>We patched in a fix that would break the game if you clicked on either Fellowship Overview or Battle Management buttons during a battle, and stopped you from being able to attack enemies regardless of range as it made the game mechanics confusing.<br/><br/>Created for LD49 - Unstable by BrainoidGames, HonestDanGames and\u00a0ElysiaGriffin.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T07:55:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bbaa16655d1df2a99c37be29d51dfd99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HonestDan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
