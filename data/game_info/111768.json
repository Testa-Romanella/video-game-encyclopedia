Place either your left or right palm closely over a basketball to pick it up. To throw the ball, thrust your palm away from you. The harder you throw, the faster the ball will go. The moment your hand slows down, the ball will release. Snapping your wrist at the end of your thrust will also release the ball and provide some spin.</p><p>Keep in mind the interaction zone of the Leap Motion. Short, straight thrusts in front of the Leap Motion controller produce the best results.</p><p>\r\n\tMaking a straight shot is 1 point, while bouncing the ball off of the side walls to make a shot is 2 points. Check out the video attached to this page to see a demonstration. </p><p>\r\n\tHave fun and feedback is welcome!</p>SFX Credits:A few audio clips in the game come from these sources:<ul><li>soundbible.com</li><li>freesfx.co.uk</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28d81a482f1f3235802f89d576f79d60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mikedurn"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
