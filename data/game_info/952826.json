Humanity has used up almost all its resources. The ozone layer is collapsing, plants are dying and the planet is cooling. Mankind is looking for a new home. Mars is the prime target, scientists have discovered water, which means life is possible. Hoping to create a habitable environment, humans have sent robotic cultivators there. The main mission is to green Mars and create a suitable atmosphere. But alas, the landing didn't go according to plan, the spacecraft exploded as soon as it approached Mars. Only one robot remains intact and resources are scattered all over the planet. But the problems don't end there. Communications are down. Commands from Earth are no longer being received. But there is no deviation from the plan. The cultivators begin their work.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPurpose: To create a habitable environment for humans; to re-establish communication with the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n\r\nWASD - character control\r\n\r\nQ - crafting menu\r\n\r\nE - skip dialogues\r\n\r\nB - activate construction mode/throw the item out of your hand\r\n\r\nLMB on item in inventory - place item in your hand for construction\u00a0\r\n\r\nLMB on construction cell - place item out of hand\r\n\r\nRMB on item in construction cell - remove item from cell\r\n\r\nLMB close to a building - to repair a building\r\nLMB close to bug - to destroy it\r\nWe worked on the game:\u00a0\r\n\u00a0Artist:\r\n\u00a0https://dryom.itch.io\u00a0\r\n\u00a0Programmers:\r\n\u00a0https://ho1low.itch.io\r\nhttps://emelme.itch.io/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T10:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46de9269c35f44afffbc28d27063ee03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Hollow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
