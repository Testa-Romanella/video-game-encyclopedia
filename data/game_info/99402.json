It hasn't been the case for Rakiyah and her dwindling relationship. She loves her boyfriend from the very bottom of her heart, but his job has separated them for far to long. Fond memories aren't enough to keep her warm at night, especially with temptation so close by. Will Rakiyah choose to stick to her relationship to the end or break it off once and for all?</p>\n<p><strong>D</strong><strong>eveloper's Notes: </strong></p>\n<p>Sweethearts is a Valentine's inspired visual novel. I wanted to experiment with a more mature romance story-line than what I usually found on lemmasoft. I also wanted to finish this story before Valentine's day, which gave me less than 14 days to complete it. I found that I work better on time constraints, so I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish. I eventually updated the artwork and added a new watercolor texture to the backgrounds. The art style is a little inconsistent, but I'm evolving with every project I complete, and this one by far might be my prettiest game yet.
