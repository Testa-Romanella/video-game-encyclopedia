{"id": 54997, "slug": "colossal-cave-adventure", "name": "Colossal Cave Adventure", "name_original": "Colossal Cave Adventure", "description": "<p>Colossal Cave Adventure (also known as ADVENT, Colossal Cave, or Adventure) is a text adventure game, developed originally in 1976, by Will Crowther for the PDP-10 mainframe. The game was expanded upon in 1977, with help from Don Woods, and other programmers created variations on the game and ports to other systems in the following years.<br />\nIn the game, the player controls a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be filled with wealth. Players earn predetermined points for acquiring treasure and escaping the cave alive, with the goal to earn the maximum number of points offered. The concept bore out from Crowther&#39;s background as a caving enthusiast, with the game&#39;s cave structured loosely around the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky.<br />\nColossal Cave Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction and, as the first text adventure game, is considered the precursor for the adventure game genre. Colossal Cave Adventure also contributed towards the role playing and roguelike genres.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1976-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T11:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/421/421c6da4384f2c98dc3da40e662c8316.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 13, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 6, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Willie Crowther", "Wolfgang Strobl", "Don Woods", "William Crowther"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Wolfgang Strobl"], "esrb_rating": null}
