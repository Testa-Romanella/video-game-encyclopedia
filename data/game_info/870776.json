People with sensitivity please be wary of the Cyberdemon's trap.</p>\r\nThe Magus Interna\r\n<p>This little Cyberdemon is a helpful friend! They were willing enough to hold my Spellbook for me. No idea where they came from, they don't say too much. But I'm glad they are here to present my grimoire.<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nThe Spell Book\r\n<p>The Spell book holds a lot of secrets. It also holds back other Cyberdemons and AI entities. In fact, 98% of this Grimoire was made by artificial intelligence. I ran stable diffusion natively with a lot of fun prompts. I also used novelai.net to get a lot of the articles &amp; stories. I did this project for a Zine show.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nOther Elements\r\n<p> The pages randomly select when you click on the book. I did this so it felt more like the physical versions of the zine. All of the zines had random pages selected so everyone that got one had a different book. Not only did that make them feel more personal but it encourages people to talk to others in order to find all the pages and compare info.<br/><br/>I did leave some pages out of this digital version. Those pages were Sigil pages where people could draw their own sigils. Maybe if I make this one more interactive I'll add them back, but blank boxes just didn't seem fun to put in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T11:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fa2df1723bb5a699787916dee62bc2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BTL games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
