A whole lot of smooches.</p>\n<p>Smooch League is very simply fencing with kissing instead of swords. Your goal is to beat your opponent by scoring enough kisses to win. You will have to get in close and kiss your opponent without letting them kiss you first, as whoever initiates the kiss will earn the point for it. Good luck, and happy smooching!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc72993bc0db094633e6212e706b043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ali K"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
