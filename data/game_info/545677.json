I learn much from make this game. I get more inspired from brackeys and another developer game to make this game.</p>\n<p>Sorry, i don't know how to make devlog, but i have list what i learn in this game:</p>\n<ol><li>Make Enemy have distance from another same enemy with script call static List&lt;Rigidbody&gt;. in that case enemy or Prefabs enemy can not overlap with another enemy with same script.</li><li>Make story for my game with animation. Out one by one setting use animation.</li><li>make ultimate for my player can out shoot auto with rotation and instantiate bullet in 4 place different.</li><li>Make UI health above enemy head. To make this i make canvas UI and place that child in enemy and change render mode from overlay to world space and move that UI to above enemy head</li></ol>\n<p>One problem i not yet learn from make this game is make background parallax for 2D top-down-shooter. I still learn how make this parallax for top-down-shooter.
