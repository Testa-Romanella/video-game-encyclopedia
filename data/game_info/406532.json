{"id": 406532, "slug": "the-art-house-vr", "name": "the art house VR", "name_original": "the art house VR", "description": "<p><strong><em>the art house VR</em></strong> a virtual art space dedicated to curating and supporting online artists. This is a VR project I'm making with support of the Oculus Launch Pad program.</p>\n<p>This is just a demo of the space, featuring art from @mushbuh, @online_frog, and @mintdecot. There's a mix of paintings, sculptures, music, videos and fashion.</p>\n<p>I'm also prototyping social features like leaving Art Reactions on art (kinda like twitter likes or facebook reactions), as well as artist support features such as an\u00a0IAP called ArtCoins that's used\u00a0for donations and fun activities with proceeds going towards artists. There's also an email list feature where you can request more info about certain exhibits or artists in the VR space and you'll get an IRL email about it!</p>\n<p>As this project is still in development and primarily targeting Oculus,\u00a0<strong><em>the art house VR</em></strong> is available on the Oculus Store in an alpha release channel for testing purposes. If you would like to be part of alpha/beta testing for this project, feel free to message me or email hello@thearthousevr.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:51:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ba/9badbfe302976d8bc6ca96687ebe15a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamsf"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
