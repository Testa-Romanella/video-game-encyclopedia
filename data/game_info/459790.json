When you start playing the level, two ways seems like a stealth game, but when you get to the guns package the game turns into a shooter. That is how i have integrated the game jam\u00a0theme\u00a0\u00a0(\"two\") into the game</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>a/w/s/d -&gt; Movement</li><li>Mouse click -&gt; shoot/attack</li><li>1 / 2 -&gt; change weapons</li><li>Esc -&gt; go back to the menu</li></ul>\n<p>Story: the world has been dominated by robots, you are a member of the resistance. Your mission is to steal guns from a robot military base;</p>\n\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>When you start the game you have no way of fighting the robots, so you should use stealth to your advantange.<br/>During this fase you can pick up ammunition or health, which will be very useful later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The guns are inside a box like this.</p>\n\n<p>Once you get to the box all the robots in the base will know your position, so be ready to fight. Now that you have picked up the box you can use the guns inside (a pistol and a knife) to fight the robots. Your mission now is to get to the place where you started.</p>\n<p>The key of the game is the balance between the danger of picking up ammo or health when you are in stealth and the danger of fighting with less ammo or health</p>\n\n<p>This is my first Game Jam so I am a begginer.<br/></p>\n<p>Assets used in this game:</p>\n<ul><li>Box:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/box-2</li><li>Action music:\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/action-music/9</li><li>Stealth music:\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/funny-music/21</li><li>Ammo pickup sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/zivs/sounds/433771/</li><li>Health pickup sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/KeshaFilm/sounds/471834/</li><li>Pistol sound: https://freesound.org/people/michorvath/sounds/427592/</li><li>Shotgun sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/michorvath/sounds/427595/</li><li>Ammo pack: http://pixelartmaker.com/art/1ae0e10a611b08b</li><li>Some particles: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/cartoon-fx-free-109565</li><li>Character animations:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/animated-top-down-survivor-player</li><li>IA and part of the camera are based(although heavily\u00a0 modified) in this:\u00a0https://codeartist.mx/hotline-miami/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/017/01751b2203aed39d78a6a3d49af9dce3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["marclandes"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
