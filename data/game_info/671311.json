It was held from August, 13 to 15, 2021 and took place at the Pr\u00fcfeninger Schlossgarten \u2013 a really nice location.</p>\n<p>All started on Friday afternoon (theme announcement) and ended Sunday  afternoon after project presentations. The given theme was \u201cbeat.me\u201d  (as a beat festival was happening there on Saturday as well).\r\n    </p>\n<p>For \"Sleeper-Beat\", miko93 teamed up with talented 2D artist Daria,  and they decieded to follow one of Daria's ideas and make a small \u201csearch  &amp; click\u201d game. There, one needs to find sleeping Regensburg  inhabitants within a certain time and wake them up by \u201cbeating\u201d  (clicking, that is). Daria did all the cute graphics, while miko93 stuck to  programming. They used Unity 2021 and a screen format of 1136\u00d7640,  suitable for mobile (although exported to WebGL only).\r\n    The jam was set up as a hybrid event. One could participate on site,  remote or mixed. For this project, the team met on Friday and Sunday, working  from/at home on Saturday.</p><p>The idea could be developed further, maybe by introducing a city map with different locations to be visited/played and rising difficulty levels (shorter time and more \u201cdifficult\u201d pictures).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T04:58:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ac/8acb0ed6f6360372821717e7d91f60ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["miko93"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
