Your buds might need a little help, so pull them around with your bungee arms\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and use them to navigate and open up new paths.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong><br/>Win each level by getting the required number of buds into the goal (indicated by the remaining number on the flag).\u00a0 Blue buds are too scared to venture off on their own, so you'll have to bungee them to you and drag them along to the goal.\u00a0 Blue buds will automatically bungee to other blue buds when\u00a0 attached to you, creating a chain of buds. This opens up tons of opportunities, but be careful as there are many hazards and obstacles that will stand between you and that sacred soil!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>WASD - Move<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Mouse - Target buds\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Left Click - Grab a bud w/ bungee<br/>Right Click - Release your buds<br/>Shift + WASD - Move buds around player<br/>R - Reset level if in unwinnable state</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/><em><strong>SzechuanSteve</strong> - Game Design, Programming, Art &amp; Sound</em><br/><em><strong>Tim Przybylinski</strong> -\u00a0Music</em><br/><br/><em>***This game and all assets were created in under 48 hours during GMTK 2021 Jam***</em><br/><br/><strong>Developer's Note</strong>: Really happy with what I was able to pull together in only 48 hours. I would have liked to showcase more of my puzzle and mechanic ideas for the buds, but level design took a lot longer than anticipated.\u00a0 \u00a0Some things I wanted to implement, but was unable to due to time constraints: Buds pushing blocks, buds pulling levers , buds grabbing keys, and a boss battle where you have to move buds around yourself to avoid them getting hit while trying to hit a sequence of switches.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:21:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe6e1a88ccf34399ccfa5b6ba145405e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SzechuanSteve", "Da4RealDeal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
