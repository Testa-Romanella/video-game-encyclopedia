Your objective is to survive for 48 hours to prove Mars is habitable. Be careful though, anything can and will go wrong.</p><p>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>To\u00a0survive 48 hours you need too eat many potatoes, which you can harvest on top-left farm. But before you eat it, you need to bake it, and Mars environment temperature should help you. Of course you can bring only one potato.\u00a0Next you have \u00a0physical endurance which you can recharge by sleeping on your bed.<br/>And it's not all. Mars really doesn't like humans, so it often destroy your machines which you bought on aliexpress last summer. So you need to repair them as quickly as possible or something will not grow, will not work etc., you know?<br/>And do not forget. Just 48 hours and you can fly home. Good luck.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Programming: \u0160imon Svoboda<br/>Music, Sounds and UI: Oleg Petruny<br/>Graphics: Denys Boyko, Krist\u00fdna Harvanov\u00e1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T07:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/075/07590ef02259f7d7575f71dd49b7c966.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["apesticka", "Gig4but", "doc.doctor", "harvanok"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
