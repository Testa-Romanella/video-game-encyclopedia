{"id": 943059, "slug": "uroras-music-box", "name": "@urora's music box", "name_original": "@urora's music box", "description": "<p>Aurora is a Rhythim-based rogue-like where the main track is procedurally generated. The game was made in one week for the 7DRL Challenge 2023. The game was done by one person [me :) ], and it's mostly a rhythm game with some rogue-like elements, some meta progression focused on a single character, some procedural generation, etc. In the game, you control your character with WASD, W moves you up, S moves you down, D makes a melee attack, and A puts down a mine. Mines are activated by pressing A again. Furthermore, you can hit your mine with a melee attack to send it forward. Here it's a list of some enemies you might encounter:</p>\n<ul><li>E: a Regular Bandit;</li><li>Z: a Zombie, is really slow;</li><li>#: a Brute, similar to a zombie, but stronger;</li><li>R: an indestructible piece of the environment (rock);</li><li>B: a Bat that shoots projectiles;</li><li>F: a Flying Harpy also shoots projectiles and can dodge some attacks;</li><li>G: a Ghost Armor that is immune to physical attacks;</li><li>S: a Spell Devour, a swift creature immune to magic damage.</li></ul>\n<p>Killing these enemies will reward you with experience. Level-ups are automatic, and they increase the damage of both of your attacks.</p>\n<p>I initially overscored the game, so the finished product is not what I was hoping for, but I think it's a fun game, and I will probably keep working on it. I kindly accept any feedback and advices for moving on with this product.</p>\n<p>Ty :)</p>\n\n<p>[NOTE: I recommend you play the downloadable version]<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T21:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15c/15c17afb3fe24a84e3ed9d546fc2be68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Wyvex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
