The player can move one piece per turn, and the player may only move a piece to a particular place if there is a path (linked set of vertical and horizontal empty cells) between the current position of the piece and the desired destination. The goal is to remove pieces by forming lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of at least five pieces of the same colour (four in the early levels). If the player does manage to form a line of at least four/five pieces of the same colour, the pieces in those lines are removed, and he gains one turn, i.e. he can move another piece. If not, three new pieces are added, and the game continues until the board is full. <br/><br/>Pieces are moved by selecting a piece and dragging it to an empty square on the board. Alternatively, you can tap to select a piece and then tap on the target board square. Tap again on a selected piece to unselect.<br/><br/>There is an 'undo' button if you make a bad move and should you wish, you can even undo all the way back to the start of the game!<br/><br/>ARCADE MODE<br/><br/>This mode has special pieces and power ups that will help you complete the game:<br/><br/>SPECIAL PIECES<br/><br/>\u2606 Timed Piece<br/>The Timed Piece has a counter that counts down each time the player takes a turn.
