Earthlings are in trouble. They need to push back and take the fight back to them, to the alien home-world. A stealth super-weapon developed at Area 51 has been proven to deliver on the promise. What is that weapon?  BINGO!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYes, a classic game of BINGO! Play One, Two, or Three BINGO cards! Flick the ball at the matching number on the card to daub. Toss a ball away from the card to discard. Connect a full line of daubs in a row, diagonal, or a column to make a BINGO and get a new card!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow can BINGO! defeat aliens, you ask? It would be too complicated to explain here, but it is awe-inspiring. Aliens don't like losing, and especially when playing BINGO!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach BINGO! gets earthlings closer to the goal of defeating aliens. Each card is a ticket to success. Make your way to the alien council.
