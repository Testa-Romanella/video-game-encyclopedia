Vendors are also scattered so you can upgrade your weapons and purchase extra ammunition.</p>\n<p>If Woofgang's health gets too low, he can enter Wolf Out Mode. In Wolf Out Mode, you can only use punches, but they deal immense damage.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/>Controls:</p>\n<p>[WASD] Move<br/>[Space] Jump / [A/D] + [Space] Wall Jump<br/>[Right Click] Aim / [Left Click] Shoot<br/>[Q] Wolf Out<br/>[H] Heal<br/>[S] + [Space] Descend from Platform<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/>Credits:</p>\n<p>Game Design: Stavros Spyridonos<br/>Level Design &amp; Programming: Nicolas Joukowski<br/>Lead Programmer: Aimilios Seimenis<br/>---<br/>Assets Used:<br/></p>\n<p>---Graphics---<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/crosshairs-plus-139902<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/mighty-heroes-rogue-2d-fanta...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/eu-sci-fi-textures-s...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sprite-muzzle-flashe...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/toon-bear-sprites-with-anima...</p>\n<p>https://unsplash.com/photos/rhRlzHJcv5w</p>\n<p>---Plugins---<br/>http://dotween.demigiant.com/<br/>Cinemachine</p>\n<p>---Sounds---<br/>http://pmsfx.com/<br/>http://sonniss.com/<br/>http://freesound.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:17:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b876e7e1a2eaf57632c81522a21c1241.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u00c6milius", "Nikolas Joukowski"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
