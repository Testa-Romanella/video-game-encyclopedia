It is an incredibly short story where you choose your own outcomes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have difficulties reading certain fonts or text on coloured backgrounds please look at the screenshots to ensure you will be able to play this game. There are no settings to enlarge the font or to turn on auditory help, sorry.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is the first in a series of Tiny-Games.\u00a0They are fully playable short experiences, designed by me to improve my skills in a few selected\u00a0 areas of game creation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game's focus: Text choices, scriptable objects, creating dynamic backgrounds. I think I achieved what I\u00a0was going for. I need much more practice in some areas but I am happy with the result of this. I scoped well and only went over my projected finish by a few days.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game was fully created by Kitten of Walrusware</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T05:05:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1e/d1e1f9f7dabae560f364104ae5248cea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Walrusware"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
