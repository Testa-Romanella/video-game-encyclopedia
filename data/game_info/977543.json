Your choices determine the nature of the beast and its physical make up. Her fate is in your hands. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nInspired by transgressive horror like The Babadook and The Lighthouse and taking narrative cues from story-driven classics like Disco Elysium,  Descent of the Hunted explores coping with trauma in our modern world of isolation and electronic pacifiers. How little one must do to appear to be managing. How anonymous our suffering. In such an environment, does it really matter if the monsters are outside our minds or within?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCONTENT NOTES: The horror content is unnerving but not gory or startling and a play through of a single route takes about an hour and a half. There are three routes and four endings to explore, plus achievements for different play styles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-26T07:31:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88a/88a48e5290131fc51635735d21546e03.jpg", "website": "https://calamitybaygames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calamity Bay Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Calamity Bay Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
