The game is a conversation with your \"Inner Light\", and talks about how to see the good in your life (regardless of the darkness!). </p>\n<p>A Light in the Darkness was made in 2 days, and it's just something \r\nthat I felt I wanted to make this weekend. It\u2019s my first time writing \r\nsomething like this, and it\u2019s very, very simple, but I hope someone \r\nfinds it at least a little bit uplifting. And, of course, I wish \r\neveryone a fantastic 2018! =D</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Created and written by Joshua Hallaran.</p>\n<p>Developed in RPG Maker MV, which is the property of Enterbrain and Degica. </p>\n<p>Assets sourced from Opengameart.org:</p>\n<p>Another August - Music from The Cynic Project / cynicmusic.com / pixelsphere.org</p>\n<p>Sparkles Animation - \u00a9 2005-2013 Julien Jorge <julien.jorge@stuff-o-matic.com></julien.jorge@stuff-o-matic.com></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89d/89d8c9fa856a7ed57bb8522031bd028a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CriticalGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
