In this purgatory of\r\ncapitalism's inextricable excesses and failings there is a dream of a\r\nkind of vanished commons--a place we once browsed together before\r\nSchumpeter's gale drove us\r\ninto our homes and deeper into ourselves.</p>\n<p>The cathedral carcass of a dead whale\r\nthat fed your town for decades. You stroll the promenade huffing\r\nfumes and recalling oilier times.</p>\n<p>An eternal Sunday afternoon in Fall.\r\nOutisde it's cold, but here under the skylight it's\r\nwarm and pretzel scented, and you can pretend you don't have school in the morning.</p>\n<p>You can go deeper into the feeling or\r\nyou can try to flee from it, but you will always be where you are.</p>\n<p>The soundtrack for this experience was\r\ncreated by Dani Lee Pearce: danileepearce.bandcamp.com</p>\n<p>This project was produced for the\r\nexhibition Dire Jank at apexart organized by Porpentine Charity\r\nHeartscape:</p>\n<p>https://apexart.org/exhibitions/heartscape.php</p>\n<p>Some technical support was provided by\r\nJeremy Rotzstain, and Seanna Musgrave. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T06:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/26944f912e8a81e762a8cac1cc3ba446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tabitha Nikolai"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
