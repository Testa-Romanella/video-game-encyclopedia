Smith Games<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWelcome to Archaeology! <br/>\r\n\tHere are the details of playing the game. <br/>\r\n\tFirst select a surveyor to find good locations for treasure. If treasure is found nearby, the ground will be highlighted with a certain color: <br/>\r\n\tWhite - no treasure near <br/>\r\n\tBlue - little treasure <br/>\r\n\tGreen - moderate treasure <br/>\r\n\tYellow/Red - lots of treasure <br/>\r\n\tOnce you find a good location for treasure, assign an excavator to that area. If the excavator successfully digs up treasure, it will be shown in the world. Then assign an appraiser, who will determine the value of the treasure and add it to your total money. <br/>\r\n\tRepeat until you've found all of the treasure, but you have only until 7pm before the game is over. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tResources <br/>\r\n\tSurveyor (Tripod Icon) - Finds the best spots to dig <br/>\r\n\tExcavator (Shovel Icon) - Digs for treasure <br/>\r\n\tAppraiser (Magnifying Glass Icon) - Determines how much discovered treasure is worth <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tControls <br/>\r\n\tLeft Mouse Click - Press buttons / Place objects <br/>\r\n\tRight Mouse Drag - Move camera view <br/>\r\n\tMouse Wheel - Zoom In/Out\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Subscribe on YouTube | Follow on Twitter | Like on Facebook</p>\n<p>Time Lapse Development<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c28/c28cf0fcddf510ffb2ecc287a7b57238.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Levi D.
