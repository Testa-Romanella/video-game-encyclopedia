After witnessing a luminous object falling into the mountains during a fireworks ceremony, they are transported to the Digital World, where they meet their Digimon partners. They are joined by classmates Hiroyuki (\u30d2\u30ed\u30e6\u30ad), a curious troublemaker, and Asuka (\u30a2\u30b9\u30ab), a caring, older-sister type, along with Hiroyuki&#39;s second-grade younger sister Yui (\u30e6\u30a4) and her friend, a first-grader named Takuto (\u30bf\u30af\u30c8).
