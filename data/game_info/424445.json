This Island\u2019s tradition involves every child to partake in the Island Trials when they reach 14 years of age.</p>\n<p>Completing the Trials makes the child the new leader of the village. The current village leader is getting old and frail and needs a successor, will you be able to complete the Island Trials?</p>\n<p>Island Trials was created as part of one of my University modules. The brief stated that I needed to create a 3rd person 3D RPG that played for at least 5 minutes. The main island where the first part of the game takes place is meant as a tutorial level with a mini quest to take an item to someone and a small jumping puzzle to get into the dungeon itself. This teaches the player the basic movements in the game before getting into the bulk of the gameplay.</p>\n<p>In the dungeon I wanted four different mechanics, or ways for the player to play. These are represented by each trial: Fire, Strength, Combat and Gauntlet. They each brought a different way to play which ensured the player didn't get bored doing the same thing.</p>\n<p>I created a lot of the 3D models myself however I used textures from the Unity asset store. I was going for a stylised approach for this game, hence why the water is a solid blue and the other textures are cartoon-y.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T03:57:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c63/c630f4ad9f13e46ce62cab185d0b3af8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abi Sanders"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
