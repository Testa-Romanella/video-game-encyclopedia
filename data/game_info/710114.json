This project involved a maze where the player must avoid 5 enemies. Over the course of the semester, I learned how to code the enemies\u2019 AI for movement and for one of them, to find the player. Another feature that I implemented from the lessons was for one of the enemies to be able to trace the path it will take to find the player.</p>\n<p>I chose this project because it covered most of the new stuff that I learned from the class.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The lessons that I learned from working on this project helped me realize just how much I didn\u2019t know about coding. After working many hours on it and getting help on it, I concluded that I wanted to work more in the design space of game development rather than the coding part. If I did want to go more in-depth with coding my own projects, I now feel I have a better skill set to do so. I could see myself using this knowledge in making a more refined 2D maze game (something like PAC-MAN) and/or another kind of 2D game where I could have the enemy chase the player.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Click I,\u00a0J, K, L, and O to spawn different enemies after the maze has been spawned in.\r\n</p>\n<p>Click P to spawn the maze and the player.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move and avoid enemies in the maze.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:28:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e7782e40227f42e7ef955ec5171b78eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DanielG23"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
