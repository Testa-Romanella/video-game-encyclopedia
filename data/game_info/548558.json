Hope you will enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>You are an archeologist who is exploring an ancient,\u00a0abandoned tower and looking for the prized artifact inside it. Once you find it, though, the technology of the tower gets activated\u00a0 and a powerful force is released, destroying anything that comes in its path!</p>\n<p>You must escape the tower before it swallows and defeats you and makes you history!</p>\n<p>What's worse? The force is constantly and slowly increasing in speed, so you must spend less time in the level in order to have a more greater chance of escaping the tower! But be reminded to be\u00a0careful of spikes and bullets...</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Left Arrow Key / A: Move left</p>\n<p>Right Arrow Key / D: Move right</p>\n<p>Space Bar/ Up Arrow Key / W: Jump (You can double jump! And as long as you touch the floor, you can always double jump, even if you are off the floor.)</p>\n\r\n\r\nThis game uses Godot Engine, available under the following license:\r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2020 Juan Linietsky, Ariel Manzur.
