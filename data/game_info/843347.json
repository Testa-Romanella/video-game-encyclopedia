It's dark, and the only source of light that illuminates the grass arround you comes from yourself. But you realize that it is also dimming, and slowly, as the loneliness increases, the less you see. With what you can identify of your surroundings, you realize a certain familiarity with the forest that surrounds you. Do you know this place? You feel like you belong here... But why is it so dark? And then you can hear it. Very quietly... a whisper. And you understand it, it is calling you! After wandering through the complete darkness, you can see. A small point of light in the distance. No, a light like yours! And now you can hear another Wisp calling you more clearly. You are not alone! But your equals are not the only ones who can feel your presence... Join them, and together, light up the forest and dispel the darkness. Save your home and bring it back to the light! You-O-Wisp, your light is not alone!<br/><br/>Made by:<br/>Athinis Crettos - Game Designer (Instagram: @Crettos)<br/>Mariana Amianti - Level Designer, Artist (Instagram:\u00a0@mariana.amianti)<br/>Rene Bertoni - Programmer (Twitch:\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/ninety_play)<br/>Thiago Lima - Programmer (Instagram: @thiago0023)<br/>Vitor Carnevalli - Level Designer, Sound Designer(Instagram:\u00a0@carnevallifotografia)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T11:41:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da9e89d23e7b329297f11a6aa972d08c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thiago0023"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
