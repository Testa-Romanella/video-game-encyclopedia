All there is left to do is spend this money, which is your goal. There are many ways to waste your wealth, you can burn your money, give it as a tip, make poor investments, gamble it, buy NFTs with it, or donate it.\u00a0 Upgrades for these money-wasting methods will appear periodically, and make it even easier to deplete your wealth. Upgrades on the left upgrade the amount of money items cost, while upgrades on the right make items recharge quicker.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T07:27:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8f/d8fd7d09b7cba5113e5346fbe97bead3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lzimm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
