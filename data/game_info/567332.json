Navigate carefully, as those asteroids still full of deadly contraptions and old defensive systems that see you as a viable target. Also, never forget that space ships are not equipped with breaks!</p>\n<p>This game is a result of an improvised game jam I devised for myself. Plan was to take a year and see how far it gets me. And while I could not finish as much as I wanted, I find that I've done enough. The game contains three rather spacious levels, a boss boss battle, couple of guns. Also producing sound effects for it was a real journey. Turns out making those not annoying is an art.</p>\n<p>In the conclusion I would like to point out that I still consider this game more of a prototype. I had planned much more: more guns, more enemies, more levels. I couldn't finish everything I had in mind, but that's how life works. I still got valuable experience. I hope I can utilize that experience for my future projects and make something bigger and better.</p>\n<p>Please, enjoy the game.<br/>\u00a0 <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T09:09:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46ff492b7db28146e2a6001b0f844826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ledocool"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
