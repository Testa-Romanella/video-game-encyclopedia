But watch out if you are moving in specific directions you could trigger chaotic special events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is Space Drive In?</strong></p>\n<p>The idea and development were part of Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2. The theme of this jam was \"Let there be chaos\" and here we are. The goal was clear - seven days to create a chaotic game.</p>\n<p>Space Drive In tries to bring some of this\u00a0chaos in an already stressful\u00a0job as a chef at a space ship.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is Space Drive In?</strong></p>\n<p>To play Space Drive In you just need to download and unzip the file and start the 'Space Drive In.exe'. The controls are pretty basic. You can move your character with <strong>WASD</strong>, keyarrows or your controller. To interact with the machines you need to press the interaction button (E).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are four different recipes and several machines. Here are some <strong>tips</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>The freezer can be used from two sides. One gives you ice the other one gives you frozen fries</li><li>To put some ketchup on your fries you need to walk over the red field with some fries in your hand</li><li>in the upper left corner and the lower right are two teleporter. But watch out you can trigger a special event which deactivates the teleporters</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Who is Space Drive In?</strong></p>\n<p>The core development are six guys.
