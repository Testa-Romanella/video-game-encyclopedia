I have taken a look at the collider issues and found that while the dead animals are not able to hurt you.. the colliders on the ones still alive are so large they stick through the dead ones as they push towards you. This is what was causing the damage from nowhere. (also the cow had an attack size almost as large as its whole body)</p>\n<p>All damage collides have been reduced in size<br/>Also note the side rails the player cannot move through now affect the animals as well, so the \"Herding\" mechanic now works as I originally intended.\u00a0<br/>UI enlarged slightly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music\u00a0</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>\"In a Heartbeat\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/338/338636928ee8616a1c5606d9f5211420.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Master Krepta"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
