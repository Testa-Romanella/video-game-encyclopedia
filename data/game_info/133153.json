Steve please defeat their Leader!</p>\n<p><strong>~AUTHOR NOTES~</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The Lore folks! truthfully this is a fangame for Steven as you noticed theres that golden circle on every one of these games, this is because all of them are part of a crew called \"Yo Videogames\" Steve here has even recently followed me on Twitter, so this game is for him and his fans, i hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>~Update V1.2 \u00a0as of May/25/2017~</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Xbox360 Controller compatible, but JoyToKey is recommended if you are using any other controller or joypad\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) if an enemy hits you while your near any of the stages walls or ceiling, there is a high chance you will get stuck inside of it, get stuck just standing, \u00a0or just float away into space, if this happens please press \"ENTER\" to get pulled out</p>\n<p>2) Special Moves dont come out? this is because the game is reading your inputs, if you press to many buttons or directions it wont recognize the special command, if you jump it deletes all recorded inputs, once you land try again.<br/></p>\n<p>thats all of the bugs I'm personally aware of, keep in mind this is just the beginning more updates and expansions will be made, I hope i made something enjoyable, any donations will probably be used to donate it back to Steve and to support my family, \u00a0you dont need to Donate, a feedback or any comments would be appreciated, take care and have fun playing, Latz!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>~CREDITS~</strong></p>\n<p>Music was Downloaded from \"downloads.khinsider\" website, all credit goes to the original composers and Capcom.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c81/c81f78c1aaaea6bf726e8f46c2cc1e1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroSerpentGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
