One button games are usually very action packed and about executing one action, but I wanted to make a slower game with multiple verbs. I came up with a very simple UI system to track input. While I was thinking of contexts to use it in, I was listening to a song called Bug Collector, by Haley Heynderickx. So, I decided to make the game a simplified of the game I had imagined in my head. I decided to put the player inside to enhance the melancholy feeling. I think this is also one of my more successful prototypes, it invokes a feeling and the one button waiting slows the feeling of the game down to a pace that is almost meditative and not too slow. If I were to continue to work on this game I would bring it into another engine and continue to build on the systems I have outlined. This was the last prototype I made and my last takeaway is that it\u2019s okay to make your games slow and without some larger stated goal.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T03:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/353ac378261d2ce9c67ad72d3b4155e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John Wanamaker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
