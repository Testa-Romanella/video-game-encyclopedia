What if your whole past was rooted deep into a disturbing mystery?</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>The Night After is a visual novel point and click adventure game set in a fictional world where monster exist.\u00a0This is a\u00a0short demo of a game\u00a0that I am working on and it showcase the overall gameplay of how the whole game is going to be.</p>\n<p>This game has horror and mystery element into it and mostly, I am excited about making the puzzles in the game. I really love puzzles and it has been a dream to make a game like this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is \"The Night After\" about?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>We follow a regular\u00a0brother and sister who's living their life happily, doing their Universities and pursuing their careers. One day, both of their parents died mysteriously and without a trace. They said it was a car accident, but they never got to see their bodies.\u00a0Their life changed after that.</p>\n<p>One year after their parents death, they\u00a0received a mysterious package related to their parents. They received the package from an unknown source and now they have to go to figure out what is going on and the mystery surrounding their parents death.</p>\n<p>Follow them as they venture into a strange land that doesn't exist in any map. A land where everything doesn't make any sense.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of characters in this game and I am always excited writing these characters. The player can choose between two characters, Jake Voss and Sally Voss. Jake and Sally are brother and sister.</p>\n<p><strong>JAKE VOSS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SALLY VOSS</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are more characters in the game but I don't want to spoil it to you guys. So I only put the main characters here. These are the characters that you can pick in the game. Currently I am focusing on Jake's story, so Sally's story is not done yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CURRENT CONTENT</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Point-and-click Puzzles</strong></p>\n<p>There will be a lot of puzzles in the game. This is a point-and-click game, player will have to solve a lot of puzzles to escape from certain situations or figure out what to do next. Player needs to finish these puzzles in order for the story to continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Character Interaction</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Player can also interact with characters that are in the player's party. You can interact with them at certain scenes and if you want the full experience, make sure to talk with all of them if you want.\u00a0Characters can sometime hint on puzzles or add more information about the story.</p>\n<p><strong>UPCOMING CONTENT</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Romance</strong></p>\n<p>There's also going to be romance in this game, but the romance system is not in this demo yet. I just planted the seed of what's to come in the upcoming game.\u00a0Who said\u00a0the you can't make a relationship despite being in a strange land?</p>\n<p><strong>Map Exploration</strong></p>\n<p>There's also going to be exploration in this game. I won't spoil anything but I am excited working on this feature. This game is going to be pretty big and long.</p>\n<p>===========================================================</p>\n\n<p><strong>WRITING AND PROGRAMMING:</strong></p>\n<p>This game is fully written and programmed by me. I am working in this game alone, but I would like to have some small team members that can help me making this game. I don't have any budget at the moment so I am working with what I have.</p>\n<p><strong>ARTS:</strong></p>\n<p>The arts in the games are various.
