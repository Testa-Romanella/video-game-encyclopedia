Speed through the mazes to collect the dots, find the optimal path, and avoid the swarms of spectres.<br/><br/>In Fluid: Special Edition, you guide Streak (a speedy black fish) through 40 levels filled with dots, obstacles, and powerups.  Each dot you collect spawns a spectre that tries to chase you down, while the powerups give an upperhand temporarily, either with a speed boost, a vortex that attracts spectres, or spectre-bursting spikes.<br/><br/>* Finish the levels as fast you can and you&amp;#39;re rewarded with up to 5 stars.  <br/><br/>* 5-star times aren&amp;#39;t initially shown, but getting a 4-star or higher time will reveal that level&amp;#39;s 5-star time.<br/><br/>* Levels are unlocked in groups of 5, with each group requiring a minimum amount of stars.<br/><br/>* Every 5th level is a bonus level (with no spectres), while every 4th group has Turbo Levels, which speed up Streak&amp;#39;s speed even more.<br/><br/>* Each group has its own Game Center leaderboard, along with a star total leaderboard.<br/><br/>* In addition, there are 12 Game Center-enabled achievements to help track your progress and further reward solid gameplay.<br/><br/>* Use the amazingly smooth and accurate virtual controls or an iOS7-compatible game controller.<br/><br/>More press reviews:<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Overall, this app is utterly flawless. From the graphics to the gameplay to the premise, everything about Fluid SE is just as lovely as it is entertaining.&amp;quot; - AppAdvice", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T01:54:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c6/9c603b5ea7eb1cde9ae3ce04c87c7a24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Radiangames"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Luke Schneider"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
