All other requirements<br/>and depedencies are packaged with the application. Most modern versions of Windows prompt to install<br/>.Net 2.0 on running the application if it's missing, but if you're running an older OS and are <br/>confused this information could be important to you.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to know how we made this fan game, we used pure C#, OpenTK (a C# OpenGL wrapper),\u00a0 OpenAL, Spine, Gimp, Anime Studio and a LOT of time and effort for two people.</p>\n<p>So with that information, you know it *should* work under mono/linux, but it hasn't been tested. I use no native bindings/apis, but I'm not sure where it'd read the save files from on linux. Maybe I'll try it out eventually.</p>\n<p>Features ~<br/>All 66 UNDERTALE items implemented.<br/>All 6 attack types implemented.<br/>At least one fight, and maybe some hidden stuff, who can say?<br/>Continue the story using your old save file!</p>\n<p>New Features ~<br/>Supports Gamejolt's Achievement API!<br/>Voice Acting!<br/>Won't eat your cereal!</p>\n<p>And finally some creditz:</p>\n<p>Voice Actor Credits (Determination Dubbed):<br/>---<br/>Justice</p>\n<p>Voiced By: KarmaVA (Carly Lloyd)</p>\n<p>Twitter: <br/>http://www.twitter.com/karmavoiceact<br/>Youtube: <br/>https://www.youtube.com/karmava</p>\n<p>---<br/>Integrity</p>\n<p>Voiced By: Stone Stephens<br/>Tumblr: <br/>http://DarknessStone.tumblr.com<br/>Youtube: <br/>https://www.youtube.com/user/DarkStoneCommentary</p>\n<p>---<br/>Patience / Perseverance</p>\n<p>Voiced By: DeluNelu<br/>Tumblr: <br/>http://Delunelu.tumblr.com</p>\n<p>---<br/>Bravery</p>\n<p>Somewhat Voiced By: AlwaysNoah<br/>Youtube: <br/>https://www.youtube.com/c/AlwaysNoah<br/>Twitch: <br/>https://www.twitch.tv/always_noah_</p>\n<p>---<br/>DJ Napstablook</p>\n<p>Voiced By: osnapitzchris<br/>Youtube: <br/>https://www.youtube.com/user/meluvsoshawott<br/>Soundcloud: <br/>https://soundcloud.com/osnapitzchriss</p>\n<p>---<br/>Asgore</p>\n<p>Voiced By: HBMike<br/>Tumblr: <br/>http://hb-mike.tumblr.com<br/>Twitter: <br/>http://www.twitter.com/mrhallowbastion</p>\n<p>---<br/>Frisk / Kindness</p>\n<p>Voiced by: Kenkoy<br/>Behind the voice actors: <br/>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/members/Kenkoy/casting-call/auditions/<br/>Twitter: <br/>http://www.twitter.com/KenkoiPhish</p>\n<p>---<br/>Chara</p>\n<p>Voiced by: Xandi Alexander<br/>Youtube: <br/>https://www.youtube.com/c/XandiAlexander<br/>Twitter: <br/>http://www.twitter.com/XandiAlexandria</p>\n<p>---<br/>Madam Sharky</p>\n<p>Voiced by: Madam Sharky</p>\n<p>Youtube: <br/>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbl-w_QPNXkIuPxMqkAdTJw<br/>Twitter: <br/>https://twitter.com/MadamSharky</p>\n<p>Song Credits (SPOILERS!!!):<br/>---</p>\n<p>(Chara theme)<br/>Cannibal - Waterflame</p>\n<p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd-JK8UWe7c<br/></p>\n<p>(???)<br/>Ill-Crowned Queen - Deerboy<br/>www.youtube.com/watch?v=46q0aN9yMXg<br/>https://soundcloud.com/deerboymusic/ill-crowned-queen</p>\n<p>End Credits (DT: Dubbed):<br/>Once Upon A Remix (Holder Remix)</p>\n<p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztCcJhJS8Q8<br/></p>\n<p>(Lock out screen)<br/>TEM SHOP - GameChops:</p>\n<p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu8A8uWAJaA<br/></p>\n<p>(original end credits)<br/>\"Megalovania\" - Adriana Figueroa</p>\n<p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2Eru52dsus</p>\n<p>Original Piano Track By:<br/>http://youtube.com/ChrystalChameleon</p>\n<p>(opening theme)<br/>Once upon a time (Orchestral Arranged) - AkagitsuneYuki (music):<br/></p>\n<p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGX8SRuQ8U0</p>\n<p>(???)<br/>Dogsong Remix - Mykal Williams<br/>https://soundcloud.com/mykalwilliams/undertale-dogsong-remix<br/></p>\n<p>(DJ Napstablook)<br/>Ghost Fight Remix - Kamex</p>\n<p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXJWj-0fUqI<br/></p>\n<p>(Madam Sharky)<br/>Exploring in the Music - L.

You guys' feedback and support has made this<br/>project far better than it would have otherwise have been.<br/>I wouldn't have got this far without you.</p>\n<p>Ryou - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1EhpvVFsai57cs9esqNlAQ<br/>Your video () inspired me<br/>to make this mod in the first place, and so without that video, this<br/>would never have existed. Even though we've never spoken.<br/>Maybe some day? :)</p>\n<p>Extra Special Thanks:<br/>---<br/>To our cat Gizmo, who tried so very very hard to help with both <br/>the programming, and the artwork.</p>\n<p>Special Thank You:<br/>---<br/>Madam Sharky<br/>We both love you.<br/>Keep doing what you're doing.<br/>If you're reading this, go tell Madam we love her, and sub to her channel.<br/>Thanks :)<br/>http://tinyurl.com/madamsharky</p>\n<p>Alpha Testers<br/>---<br/>Russ from the Etika Sponz community.<br/>Colleen, and Salback (Rob again!)<br/>as well as the people from /r/UNDERTALE who<br/>ran tests for me and provided useful feedback,<br/>such as btsilence, Phobon, and IhavenonameSDA.</p>\n<p>Love joo UNDERTALE communityz<br/>Stay the undertrash we know and love&lt;3</p>\n<p>~ Danny &amp; Kat</p>\n<p>P.P.S.</p>\n<p>Extra Special Note:</p>\n<p>Please don't steal from Toby.</p>\n<p>Go give him more money.<br/>Seriously, I mean it.<br/>Stop reading and go buy some merch or something:<br/>http://www.fangamer.com/collections/undertale</p>\n<p>Additionally, I know someone will pull all of our pictures,<br/>and work from this mod. We want you to know we are totally ok with<br/>you doing that. We are happy for you to use our images and work <br/>from this project in any way that makes you happy.</p>\n<p>However, if/when someone eventually does get to extracting the assets:</p>\n<p>PLEASE DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE TOBY FOX('s?, es? s'?), OR ANY YOUTUBER/MUSICIAN'S CONTENT.</p>\n<p>We're fine with you taking anything made by us, but we'd really prefer it if you went and grabbed the music and images from their original source if you want them.</p>\n<p>We want to send more traffic to those awesome people, not take away from them.</p>\n<p>If you do use any images created by us, cyonica would really like it if you credited <br/>her for it, she did work really hard to create these! :)</p>\n<p>Additionally, due to content included in Determination that was not created by us, please do not re-upload the Determination package onto websites/pages that include advertisements. Determination should not be monetized.</p>\n<p>Final final note:<br/>If you need to reset the game to defaults the file you're looking for is file666 (Encore) or File777 (Dubbed), <br/>%LOCALAPPDATA%/UNDERTALE</p>\n<p>Oh, and feel free to make youtube videos of this mod.<br/>And link me to them. I want to see your reactions,<br/>So that I know how to make things better.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I make no promises about additional content in the future.<br/>I really want to make my own games, but if there is enough demand,<br/>and I'm feeling determined enough? Who knows. Anything is possible.<br/>I mean, the only way this project could ever come to be is because I<br/>really love UNDERTALE, the community and everything it represents.</p>\n<p>Stay Determined.</p>\n<p>#Undertale<br/>#RPG<br/>#Bullet<br/>#Hell<br/>#JRPG<br/>#Fangame<br/>#Bullethell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-02T09:05:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cac/cac421aff73b8f03708aa27593750ffa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.17, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["geek2games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
