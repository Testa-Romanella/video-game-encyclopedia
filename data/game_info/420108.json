{"id": 420108, "slug": "disconnect-draketrought", "name": "Disconnect (draketrought)", "name_original": "Disconnect (draketrought)", "description": "https://github.com/EnoughSensei/disconnect<p>A game based on connect-4 which you can sabotage your opponents. Currently supports up to 12 players.\u00a0</p>\r\nInstalling:\r\n<p>Download the latest release. You can play on LAN without any setup. If you want to play with your friends on the internet, you must forward your Port 6007 and give them your IP. I understand that not everyone is comfortable with giving their IP, but I can't afford any server at the moment, so you must be the \"server\" for your friends. However, no one outside of your LAN can connect you if they don't have your IP.</p>\r\nRules:\r\nTurns:\r\n<p>This is a turn based game. If it is your turn, then you must select a column (by clicking left mouse button or space)\u00a0and place a piece at the bottom-most space that is empty. Before you place the piece, you may also use (by clicking right mouse button)\u00a0your chosen \"power\" (that is, if you have any uses left). You can hold TAB any time to view the scores of your opponents, as well as their powers and remaining power uses.\u00a0After placing the piece, it becomes the next person's turn.</p>\r\nScoring:\r\n<p>Your score is calculated by number of \"connections\" your pieces form. A \"connection\" is when 4 of your pieces, make a continuous line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). In the original Connect Four game, the game ends when one of the players score a point. But in this game, the game continues until all of the board is filled and at the end, the player with the highest score wins.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nPowers:\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0None: You can start without powers</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Rewind: When it is your turn, you can rewind all of the actions after your last turn and your last turn.</li></ul>\r\nAssets:\r\n<p>Background is from https://opengameart.org/content/tile by Jordan Irwin</p>\n<p>Checker piece is from https://opengameart.org/content/checkers by Andi Peredri</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T02:37:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bccf27ff1ef115b2f6692e88578e8a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["draketrought"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
