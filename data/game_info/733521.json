The prompt table will slowly guide you through weeks of fights, interactions, and opportunities to get your imagination and creativity cooking.</p>\n<p>I was heavily inspired by\u00a0The Immortal Iron Fist run by David Aja, Matt Fraction, and Ed Brubaker. If you haven't checked out their brilliant run on that comic, please do so, it's absolute genius and fun. Their second storyline, <em>The Seven Capital Cities of Heaven</em> is perfection, and will help you unleash the underground gonzo side of your brain that will make this game even more fun!</p>\n<p>To play this game, you only need a d20, a d6, and the way and will to write out an awesome adventure.</p>\n<p>This game was created using the\u00a0Second Guess System by Gamenomicon\u00a0- which is utterly brilliant in construction - and inspired by their\u00a0Hard Case\u00a0game - a brilliant single page of construction and genre.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you like this, please check out my other single page solo journaling rpgs:</p>\n<ul><li>Welcome To Faraday\u00a0- a suburban horror story</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T06:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34e/34e56a8655e78623631244c5d893f356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ryanklindsay"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
