Run, jump, slide, grab, and toss your way through 6 bite-sized areas as you search for a mysterious\u00a0meteorite that fell nearby!</p>\n<p>This is my first published video\u00a0game, and a project near and dear to my heart.\u00a0Although I wrote the music, code, and pixelled art for\u00a0the actual game by myself, that does not mean I could have done it alone! In particular, I would like to extend special\u00a0thanks to\u00a0@osmoru, whose adorable\u00a0artwork formed the basis of the cartridge label design, and @kitorchid, who made the\u00a0incredible cover\u00a0art for the soundtrack. In addition to those commissions, I also received wonderful artwork of Sybil\u00a0from @MarziManed and @_pexl, who are both very cool artists that you should check out as well! And of course, I would like to thank all testers and of course my friends, without y'all none of this would have been possible. And thank YOU for playing!!!</p>\n<p>If you have any thoughts, found a bug, or just wanna say hi, you can comment below, or message me on twitter\u00a0@sol_foxie!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T06:10:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/898/8980d081e042f3880985ab9ee09b59ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["sol"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
