That being said, this game only showcases 15% of the RUUF's full potential, limiting to basics, such as dialogues, movement an interctions (100% includes weapons, much more functionalities, further optimizations,\u00a0\u00a0multiple AI, and some errors you might encounter here are already fixed there). On a further note, the next game will have some historical relationship to this game. Code was made 100% by me, and house too, however, soundtrack, smaller assets such as furniture and other similar things were not made by me (credits in the game)</p>\n<p>I do want to thank John Wolf for the oportunity in any case</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69c/69cf8205313af9e9db64699c155094ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShrimpTraveller"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
