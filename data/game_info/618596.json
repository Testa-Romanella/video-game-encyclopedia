Grab it. Change its orbit such that it will burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Let it go. Accelerate before you burn up yourself. Try to destroy as much debris as possible.</p>\n<p>Navigating space in low orbit is extremely difficult, so being able to remove even one piece of debris is already quite an accomplishment.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left click: Capture the mouse cursor so you can move the camera with your mouse.
