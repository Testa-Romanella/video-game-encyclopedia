You create life and livestock, predator and prey and then attempt to balance the equation of coexistence.\u00a0<br/><br/>(Note that we have elements of humor implemented in the game, it was never meant to harass or hurt any individual's feelings, they're merely there as comic relief)<br/><br/>Gameplay: The basic idea of the game is to balance the population of carnivores with that of\u00a0herbivores.\u00a0The Playfield is supposedly divided into 2 regions - the right is a jungle, apt for carnivores such as lions and wolves, while the left is a grassland, fit for herbivores such as gazelles, cows and sheep. You as God can create an undefined amount of either of these. Herbivores are free to produce, for their food resource is abundant, while to produce carnivores you must rely on a 'Food' based currency. Now how can one truly be God if they can't access the other side of the coin that is life? Yes, clicking on an animal would instantly kill them, POOF!</p>\n<p>The main interaction between the aforementioned 2 regions is when a random carnivore would cross over to the grasslands in search for food (note that herbivores don't cross over to the other side for they already have a steady resource of fodder). The hungry carnivore (the embodiment of gluttony that it is) kills any herbivore it comes in contact with. That said, carnivores generally have a short lifespan.</p>\n<p>In general, just remember that the number of carnivores should neither go dangerously low, for it would cause overgrazing, nor should it shoot up way up, as that would cause global extinction of their only food.</p>\n\n<p>Origin: You Rule was created as an entry to a game jam held in my college back in\u00a02018. The theme was 'Conservation of Wildlife'. We were a team of 4 doing tasks ranging from art to programming, music to vfx!\u00a0We came across this post on a website on GTA V that depicted a simple concept of 'Play God'. That coupled with wildlife encouraged us to go this way for the project. The idea that we wanted to convey was that not every life is meant to be saved, that overpopulation of any one species or type of animal could potentially doom them all! The concept had the original theme in it but as a bonus we were also able to\u00a0bring something that contrasts it into the limelight\u00a0as well and that was something that really appealed to us.</p>\n\n<p>Future Plans:</p>\n<ul><li>Since its inception, we have wanted to implement the last of the trinity - omnivores! Humans are probably the only member that would be featured (although crows and/or bears would be interesting). The gameplay would immensely be affected by such a race's interaction with itself (evolution, civilization and technology, I'm looking at you) so we thought we'd bench it for the moment.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>There was an initiative to include Wrath - an arsenal of 'card up your sleeve' moves such as Flood, Cyclone, Plague, Meteor Showers\u00a0and the infamous Purple Grimmace's Snap - within the jam build itself but we already had loads\u00a0of logical blocks to deal with because of our limited knowledge of the engine.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T03:35:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db4/db4ad375a73a12e8607eb64b5e12f24a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Haemo Goblin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
