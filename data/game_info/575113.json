The game idea is to make sandwich by combining bread toppings based on your customer. Every correct order you get 100 points and move to next stage. Every right topping you get 25 points. First you have 10 seconds and going forward on the stages the time will be lower! You have 3 tries and you lose one try if you make wrong sandwich or time goes to 0.
