It\u2019s a story of a person with a cognitive disorder, who is trying to recollect the elusive past \u2013 before the disease takes over and everything will fade away.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHow would you feel, if you couldn\u2019t recognise your life, your loved ones and even yourself? Could you find a light in the dark maze of human consciousness? Could you remember the story?\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nINNOVATIVE PUZZLES THAT ARE THE STORY\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nEach level sparks a little memory of the person\u2019s life. It\u2019s a two-part puzzle: a visual image of the memory and a telescopic text, that reveals itself with every step. You start with fragmented pieces of the picture attached to dashed lines. Dragging them like strings, you move parts of the image to restore it. In turn telescopic text reacts to your every step \u2013 the closer you are to the solution, the more text unfolds. And if you're not moving in the right direction, the story piece too can drift away from the truth. You are indeed remembering \u2013 adding details to the memory and forming a clear picture.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nRELAXING AND ATMOSPHERIC\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe game has a delightful relaxing flow with atmospheric music and haptic feedback - all this helps you to dive into this compelling story even more. No scores, no timers, no \"game over\".\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS STORY\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nG30 is about memory and consciousness \u2013 and what they mean for a human being. There are people around who are losing their ability to remember \u2013 some kinds of mental diseases do that to a person. G30 shows how they see the world, how they feel about the past they can\u2019t remember and the reality they can\u2019t recognize.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAWARDS\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe \u201cMost Innovative Game\u201d award at both Casual Connect USA and Casual Connect Kyiv, \u201cBest Mobile Game\u201d and \u201cCritics' Choice\u201d at GTP Indie Cup, \u201cGDC Special Award\u201d and \u201cAmazon Special Award\u201d at Get IT Conference.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:00:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/19d/19de1fe4d98060d901ecc738bb63940e.jpg", "website": "http://g30game.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
