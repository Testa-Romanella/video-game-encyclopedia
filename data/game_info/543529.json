Rock, Paper, Scissor Island is a simple RPG, yet can be unpredictable and enjoyable. You are a Chicken that's mission is to restore peace to RPS Island by fighting your way through the many monsters that lark in order to find the most powerful element in the game. FIRE.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You must move through the game with a max health of only 100, so try and find some items that can help you keep your health up. The AI is random and unpredictable and gets harder as you move forward. Beating the game once doesn't mean you will the second time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you guys enjoy. This is my first attempt at making an RPG and I look forward to exploring the field further. If the game seems enjoyable I will continue to make it better.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:34:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48a/48a859f1a0929ef5a23e41cbdadc7a8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["NewGameDev1"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
