The case should be solved by referring to the data related to the suspect's superpower.<br/>Fortunately, it's not just the criminal who can use superpowers. All of my colleagues in Mana's case are Staffers. <br/>(Except for the new Notrick!) <br/>Senior investigators use superpowers to investigate cases and document the results. <br/>Statements that can tell the lie, field photos that tell us when the trace was made, and investigation records that contain part of the past! <br/>Find the contradiction between the various clues! <br/><br/>The more you solve the mystery, the closer you get to the bottom of the case!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T03:11:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1c/a1c317988aa851e3aaa6ceef4fcc9157.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Tetrapod"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Team Tetrapod"], "esrb_rating": null}
