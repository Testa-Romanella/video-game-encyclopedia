Failure of metaphor through mechanics and disintegrations of <br/>readings will reveal the game's narrative. I want to build a play within a play, but not a game <br/>within a game, and then make choice an uncertain and scary thing as outcomes are <br/>unpredictable and possibly brutal. The game play is simple. The player has to move animals <br/>around a zoo by placing food into the cages. If the animal likes the food in the cage next to it <br/>more than the food it has, it will move. <br/><br/>-Overview <br/>Zookeeper has a multi-layered narrative. The first layer, and the real world events, are that a long-distance spaceship freighter has failed to put the proper procedure in place to prevent AI corruption, leaving a young, premature AI in charge of a spaceship after the old AI malfunctions and is deleted. The spaceship crew wakes from cryo-sleep and finds themselves on a crash course that will last five days unless it is prevented. The crew has many disagreements and many prohibitions are lost as the crew hurtle towards certain death. <br/>In the game's world AI's are developed like humans with simulated childhoods and schooling and it is at the age of 20 that the AI is allowed to run a ship, and then they will do this for 1000 years before needing to be decommissioned. <br/>In the story the young AI at the age of seven is put in charge of every aspect of an interstellar spaceship and in charge of managing the crew and their relationships. This is presented to the seven year-old AI by means of a simulation that was designed to teach the basics of management. This simulation is called Zookeeper. The ship's dead AI has attempted to map the real world and simulate the referent whole within the massively oversimplified Zookeeper. This is the player's game environment and where the player will experience the story and will attempt to change <br/>The game's central experiment is to create a mechanical metaphor that the player is forced to interact with instead of interacting with a real world system. Forcing the player to try and understand the metaphor, read what is implied through the game's mechanics and to try and apply this to a real world situation. The aim of this is to make the player become uncomfortable with their actions, as misunderstanding of the metaphor can have bad diegetic consequences, and force the player to interact with an apparent, uncanny metaphor, that only presents itself as half real. <br/><br/>-How The Reveal Works <br/>The game should feel fragmented. Seeming to have many different styles and elements, but with no consistent through line. There are many points in the game where the truth behind the game is revealed, but it is probable that the player will dismiss these as just more nonsense. For example the camera panning up to reveal the exploding ship, data logs in the information screen. <br/>At whatever point the player realises the true narrative behind the game is not significant to the design, so long as the player keeps playing or replays the game. As the game's goal is not to reveal a hidden plot, but instead asks the player to interact through a laboured mechanical metaphor. Immediately figuring out in the introduction the game's story will simply result in more time where the player is attempting to understand the metaphor. And a much later revelation will result in the player thinking back to game play actions and considering what they were within the metaphor. With this design there is no single point of reveal, instead a mess of reveal and metaphor throughout the course of the game. <br/><br/>-Art Style <br/>The art of the game is supposed to look like a broken PC interface, something from a bad kid's edutainment game. The art is mainly comprised of clipart looking images, either montaged together or presented in their entirety. The in-universe explanation for this is that there is no new art being produced on the ship and the old AI has grabbed images that fit together and presented them to the young AI as the game's graphics: not painting or drawing anything original, but using a computer to attempt to replicate the real world ship through the clipart found in the ship's memory banks. <br/>Along with being a piece of narrative within the game the art is also supposed to tell the player some of the world story. Showing technical difficulties, glitches, failures of finding the right clipart, art flashing in and out, changing shape and distorting. This is supposed to show the changes in power on the ship. The failure of the AI to find the right images, of switching images in and out, and giving a sense of constructedness and falseness to the gameplay. <br/>As many of the pieces of art for the game will need to be changed and iterated upon multiple times, having more and more glitch versions and alternate versions, files should be saved as source files, easily editable. There should also be multiple variations of the source files kept and also mistakes and odd glitches made in files should also be kept, in case they are interesting. Computer-based glitches and bad edutainment games should all be used as sources of inspiration when creating the art assets, along with the standard clip art found on Windows XP machines. <br/><br/>-is it a ARG a creepy game or a clone? <br/>I believe that if I make Brechtian choices in design, manipulate artifice and the fourth wall I could make a game that challenges the player to think not escape: not for social change but for narrative understanding. I don't want to <br/>create a game that is escapist that allows the player to simply play passively. Zoo Keeper should demand thoughtfulness which, as in Brecht, does not imply disengagement and boredom. The play experience should be compelling through the concepts presented and questions asked of the player</p><p>Zoo Keeper is an educational game about running a zoo you have to move the animals
