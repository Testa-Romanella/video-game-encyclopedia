These players gets equally divided into two, three or four teams.<br/>Each team has separate color chips. There can be maximum of four players in single team and maximum of four teams in this game.<br/><br/>Each card is pictured twice on the game board, and Jacks (while necessary for game strategy) do not appear on the board.<br/><br/>The player chooses a card from their hand, and places a chip on one of the corresponding spaces of the game board (Example: they choose Ace of Diamonds from their hand and place a chip on the Ace of Diamonds on the board). Jacks have special powers. Two-Eyed Jacks can represent any card and may be used to place a chip on any open space on the board. One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent's token from a space. Players may use the Two-Eyed Jacks to complete a row or block an opponent, and One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent's advantage. One-Eyed Jacks cannot be used to remove a marker chip that is already part of a completed sequence; once a sequence is achieved by a player or team, it stands.<br/><br/>Once player has played his/her turn, player gets a new card from the deck.<br/><br/>A player may place chips on either of the appropriate card spaces as long as it is not already covered by an opponent's marker chip.<br/><br/>If a player possesses a card which does not have an open space on the game board, the card is considered \"dead\" and may be exchanged for a new card. When it is their turn, they place the dead on card on the discard pile, announce they are turning in a dead card, and take a replacement (one card per turn). Then they proceed to play their normal turn.<br/><br/>In this game, there are multiple boosters which makes the game more interesting.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T05:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a782d760b1634d0f91712ed4d8b4846.jpg", "website": "https://amunistech.in/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Amunis Technologies LLP"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Amunis Technologies LLP"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
