In our current demo, it is targeted at New York middle school students who have to take their Regent exams. However, the current game model makes it easy to adapt to other subjects from the elementary to collegiate level. Not just a set of flash cards, the game takes players for a comedic and enjoyable story as they study for their tests in whatever subjects they may be.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: We don't own any of the assets.
