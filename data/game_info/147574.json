You can play it with your keyboard or on your mobile with touch/gyro. Your job is to extinguish all flames in the level. Well, before you can do this you need a fire-extinguisher. :)</p><p>The game is decided for my 5 years old daughter, because she is really a big fan of the firefighters. \"Krause\" is the name of a firefighter of her first children's book of the fire-department. I'm a big fan of \"Nikki &amp; the robots\" and this brought up the idea for this game. If you want, you can see this like a small tribute to Nikki. :)</p><p>I had much fun to create this game and I know that 3 levels are really not enough. There are still some ideas of moving platforms or deadly smoke in buildings ... any ideas??<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to get some feedback from you. How you or maybe your children like this game? I you have any questions I will answer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57c/57c2aff28b192f7b796c3e84596a029f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pixelactivity"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
