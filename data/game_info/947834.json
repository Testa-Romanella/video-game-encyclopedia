This game asks players to construct short story poems using only the words randomly generated by this project website. These words,\u00a0identified by\u00a0Berger (1967) and Hipskind and Nerbonne (1970)\u00a0as among the most common spoken in conversation during their respective fieldwork, are often considered extraneous in Western models of data transcription. Yet such words can\u00a0be meaningful when considered in the conditions of their speech, whose delivery helps shape how their content comes to be understood. As such, it is our hope that this game will be not just entertaining for its players, but also\u00a0instructive for their conversations and indeed their future research practices.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T13:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cfa47b39e541f38acd64235aee710ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["josephis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
