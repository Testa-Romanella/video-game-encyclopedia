Create a custom character and choose from several different classes to delve deep into the mysteries of what evil lurks below. Dig down and explore the randomly generated levels, find random items, and combat deadly monsters to get the answers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThough this game looks similar to other games in the genre, it plays very differently. It is a true RPG, with many stats and character classes. It is very reminiscent of other games made by David Brevik such as Diablo, Diablo II, Hellgate: London and Marvel Heroes. With six character classes to choose from, randomly generated levels, random stats on items, secret areas, bosses, a survival talent tree and three different play modes, it delivers on a very different and unique gaming experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T02:25:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8e/f8e90da1bb8ace6306724db9ad555d13.jpg", "website": "http://www.itlurksbelow.com", "rating": 2.33, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 85, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Graybeard Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Graybeard Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
