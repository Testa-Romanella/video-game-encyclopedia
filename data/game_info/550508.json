There's been some new changes, a shift of management, some bodies moving in and out, but that's all a bit above your paygrade anyway.<br/></p>\n<p>Your job is just to find a few objects around the warehouse and place them on the conveyor belt - simple as anything really, definitely only worth minimum wage.<br/>Remember, it's a night shift, and for the sake of saving money, we've switched to new energy saving lighting fixtures, so you might need a torch! Just do your thing, and you'll get your paycheck eventually.<br/>Oh, also we've had a tiny issue with the warehouse robots, they've had a bit of an uprising and will probably try to kill you, which would cause a bit of a mess to clean up, so don't get yourself killed unless you absolutely have to.</p>\n<p>Your paycheck is on the line here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d9/7d91f4517cf5888b5cefb48ad9ac2d47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["olihewi", "JPBarroso", "Startrix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
