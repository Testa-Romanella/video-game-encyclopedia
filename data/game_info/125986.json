{"id": 125986, "slug": "town-guin36", "name": "Town (guin36)", "name_original": "Town (guin36)", "description": "<p>This game was created for my first Ludum Dare (the file is named ludumdare2 because I messed up the first project lol). The theme was \"Shapeshift\". I did not know the rules and was too excited to read up on them early on, so please forgive the use of unlicensed sprites. It will also definitely have bugs. Let me know about them.</p><p>The characters are named after some members of the Game Development Club at the University of Maryland College Park. Selection was prioritized by who went to Unity class, who went to our meetup for Ludum Dare, and who went to club meetings. All personalities in the game have little to nothing to do with actual namesakes's personalities.</p><p>It's a short game with no saving, so play through to the end in one sitting, please. The gameplay is simple, talk to all the townsfolk, go to sleep, then repeat for the next day. Alt+f4 if you need to exit.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Evan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd56fc718cbe907db349cd584bd8a90f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["guin36"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
