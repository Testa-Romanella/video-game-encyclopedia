Before the first game consoles and computers appeared, children all over the world spent hours or even days behind slot machines, planting tons of trivia. Therefore, for those who are nostalgic for those times, we created this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour character is a pixel man. You need to take him through the labyrinth to the finish line to advance to the next level. But in the labyrinth on the floor there can be traps of different colors, hitting on which the character fails and will have to start the level first.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn order to bypass the traps, you need to collect cubes of the same colors as the traps. The cube paints your character in its color and you can safely pass through a similar color trap. But at some levels, the color may automatically change with time, so be careful. For even easier passing of the game at each level there are clues.<br/>\r\nHave a good game)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n-achievements;<br/>\r\n-convenient management;<br/>\r\n- graphics in the style of retro-slot machines);<br/>\r\n-music in the style of retro-slot machines)<br/>\r\n-interesting gameplay;<br/>\r\n- unforgettable adventures;<br/>\r\n- availability in 2 languages;", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-31T04:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/902/90213975ea7394fe0fc95678741a0f33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 331, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GiBar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ILLUMICORP"], "esrb_rating": null}
