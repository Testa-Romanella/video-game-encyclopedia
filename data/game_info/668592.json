You need to keep the ship upright and moving fairly slowly to land on a pad. Once you've rescue everyone, escape beyond the top of the map.</p>\n<p>Keys are A/D to rotate, W to thrust, and Enter to shoot. The red lights on the ship turn green when it's safe to land. Gun turrets have a pretty good aim, so don't stay in one place if you're getting shot at! People left to rescue are shown in the top right corner.</p>\n<p>This was actually my first effort for 'One\u00a0game a month', but I didn't have nearly enough time to work on it, and I'm not really happy with it.</p>\n<p>You have to control a ship through a cave system, trying not to crash or get shot, and rescuing people as you go. It's quite difficult to control, as you have to keep pointing up to thrust, or you'll fall and hit the ground.</p>\n<p>I decided not to continue with the one game a month challenge, as my circumstances at the time meant I couldn't afford to devote enough time to make it worthwhile, and I didn't want to make something that I really wanted to develop further, but couldn't because the month was over, so this ended up being my only submission.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T07:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a16/a16a87f99fded21ee1a9895a100ea8fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alianna Flynn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
