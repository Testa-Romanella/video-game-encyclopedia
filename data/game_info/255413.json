{"id": 255413, "slug": "dungeon-dash-junsookim", "name": "Dungeon Dash (JunsooKim)", "name_original": "Dungeon Dash (JunsooKim)", "description": "<p>Dungeon Dash is an exciting competitive 2 player maze building/solving game with great retro graphics. It was built for Connecticut College's unique touchscreen visualization wall specifically utilizing it's touchscreen capabilities. However, any PC platform with multi-touch should be able to run this game. The game is split into two phases, the first involves the two players creating a dungeon for the other player to race through, and the second phase is actually racing through said dungeon. The twist is that players will have to find their way out of their own dungeon after completing their opponent's dungeon, allowing for a unique way of implementing player balance and ensuring that players will be able to beat the game.\u00a0<br/><br/>Song and sound effect credits to their original copyright owners. Graphics and code were entirely created from scratch.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70b/70b11c0f61e20006c349c21b626aa556.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JunsooKim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
