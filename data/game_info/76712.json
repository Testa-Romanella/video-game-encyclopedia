{"id": 76712, "slug": "exit-path", "name": "Exit Path", "name_original": "Exit Path", "description": "This is a really funny and challenging game. That you have to control two runners start at from different points at the same time. Both runners will react to your actions synchronously, but the exits and the paths are different. You have to make them get to the exit at the same time. As the more you levels you complete, the more difficult it becomes. <br/>At the beginning you have 10 lives and 2 armors, the lives will automatically recover every 5 minutes at the first. As the more lives you lost, it will take longer to recover, so please think before you move. <br/>Enjoy it !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T22:32:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e65918766ca5ca53ec7bfa6379392fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ZHANG HUIMEI"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["ZHANG HUIMEI"], "esrb_rating": null}
