Unfortunately the power has been varying drastically so you must turn on other bulbs when the power is high to keep the emergency bulb from overloading. Be careful. If you spread the power too thinly the emergency bulb will turn off! Mind the time.\u00a0Each level lasts for 24 hours: 12AM - 12PM.</p><p>NOTE:</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this game has no sound due to a build error.
