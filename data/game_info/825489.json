{"id": 825489, "slug": "shield-frequency", "name": "Shield Frequency", "name_original": "Shield Frequency", "description": "<p><strong>Shield Frequency</strong></p>\n<p>Defend the shield generator from the invaders by matching their shield frequency (color) with the color of your missiles to destroy them. Select the color of your missile by combining the Red, Green and Blue values to make the invaders color (don\u2019t worry, there is a helpful little chart to help you with the key combinations).\u00a0</p>\n<p>For example, HOLD down the Red key (A) and Green key (S) to make Yellow, target cannon with the mouse and press the left-mouse-button to fire a missle.\r\n</p>\n<p>WARNING : If you miss or the color does not match the invader, then the missile will bounce off the target and possibly hit your own shield generator causing yourself damage. So take care and make every shot count\r\n</p>\n<p>The game was created for the 2022 \u201cMini Jam 111 : Colors\u201d game jam and was created in Unity in 72 hours by me (a solo developer) and is the first game I have ever submitted for a game Jam. All the images were created, from scratch,\u00a0using Inkscape.\u00a0Please let me know what you think. It was great to push myself and learn more about Unity 2D development.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The theme of the Jam was \"Colours\", which is where the idea of mixing Red, Green and Blue values together to make different colored bullets in order to destroy the invaders.\r\n</p>\n<p>The limitation was \u201cYou Are Your Own Enemy\u201d, which was really tricky to work into the game, but, that\u2019s where I got the idea that if your missiles don\u2019t match then they bounce off and can cause your own shield generator damage if they hit it.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T05:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00d/00d8de3036375a63d55383c3ee1b4b6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Home Planet Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
