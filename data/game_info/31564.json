The game is marked for its pure focus on speed, with speeds breaking mach 3 depending on the players skill.  At these speeds the graphics and audio blur and distort, and have been compared with the psychedelic vortex sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Ballistics supports multiplayer gameplay for up to eight players across a LAN or internet.</p>\n<p>The player can detach the speeder from the track and navigate down the center in order to avoid track obstacles and to acquire the power-ups exclusively located there. Players must try to follow the outside of each curve, as hitting the inside of a curve at speed could lead to an involuntary detachment, leading to a loss of control and seconds dropped in securing reattachment.</p>\n<p>&quot;Needs a sequel using Unreal Engine 4\ufeff&quot;</p>", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2001-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T11:08:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e51/e51bed8ffc09f30987b5e8798d2ede03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["GRIN"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Xicat Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
