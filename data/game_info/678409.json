If there are problems with either platform, be sure to tell me and I will see if I can fix them soon!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Android</strong><br/></p>\n<p> This prototype was originally developed for Oculus Quest stand-alone, but I am currently transitioning to a free speech recognition solution. That's why at the moment, only the Windows version is available. A stand-alone version for Quest 1 &amp; 2 will be uploaded soon, pinky swear!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T08:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/408c3a5ae8d83e976e78f99352c778c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Mejda"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
