Go forth, guerilla gardener, and diversify!\"\r\n<p>Guerilla G\u00e4rtnern (Guerilla Gardening) was developed as part of the <br/>ITFS Creating*Diversity Game Jam. <br/>Working in the team were Oliver Meyer, Sophie Kalinowsky and Isabelle Bastian.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game your playing field is your neighbors front yard and there is but one goal: Plant as many colorful plants as you can before time runs out and your neighbor discovers what you are doing!<br/></p>\r\nEach time you go to plant something the game will hand you a random color plant. Try to organize them or sow chaos, whatever you think is most beautiful!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>For an added challenge try these extra rules!\r\n<p>1. Don't put plants of the same colour on adjacent fields. Two red flowers should not be touching on any side of the hex-grid they are planted on!<br/>2. Try planting circles out of all six plant colours! No doubles in a circle and no touching the same colour on any of the sides!<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\n\"What does gardening have to do with creating diversity?\"\r\n<p>There's six different looking and coloured plants in our game and (not so) coincidentally there's six dimensions of diversity you can define!<br/>(In case you wanted to know, these are defined as gender, sexual orientation, age, ethnic origin &amp; nationality, religion &amp; worldview and disability.)<br/>Of course it goes deeper than that, but we saw an opportunity to spread \"good vibes\" and deliver on a metaphor. Just like the monotonous front yards that players can turn into colorful gardens, diversity makes our real world more beautiful!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T05:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/282/28278fba95383bd1d9771157eafb8b52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aeonys"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
