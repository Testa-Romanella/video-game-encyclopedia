The catch is, every time the player starts to draw, everything except their own line will disappear. To succeeds one needs both an excellent memory and a steady hand. The player can, and is advised to stop at few points during a level, to\u00a0see the obstacles again.\u00a0\u00a0Until they start drawing the next line that is. How few stop can you take to beat a level?</p>\n<p>The game has 8 levels of varying difficulty. The game is controlled with a mouse. Please see the in-game tutorial for instructions on how to play.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/>lrdazrl</p>\n<p>Sound effect were created using DrPetter's sfxr tool (https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game was made for 2 Jams:<br/></p>\n<p>Mini Jam 77:\u00a0CourageTime:\u00a0April 2nd 2021 at 8:00 AM to April 5th 2021 at 7:00 AM<br/>Theme:\u00a0Courage<br/>Limitation:\u00a0Game cannot take place on earth</p>\n<p>1-Bit Jam<br/>Time:\u00a0April 3rd 2021 at 1:00 AM to April 5th 2021 at 1:00 AM<br/>Limitation:\u00a01-Bit (only Black and White pixels)<br/>(secondary) theme:\u00a0One button<br/></p>\n<p>As a result this game was made between April 3rd 2021 at 1:00 AM and April 5th 2021 at 1:00 AM.
