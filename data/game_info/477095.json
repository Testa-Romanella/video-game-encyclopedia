You can also collect more points to go even faster.</p>\n\n\r\nInformation\r\n<p>You have 2 speedometers: Your MoveSpeed counter, and your WallSpeed counter. The WallSpeed Counter is what speed you'll go at next when you start dashing, allowing you to \"store\" speed by wallrunning.</p>\n<p>Your MoveSpeed is the current speed you are going at. This speed will be transferred to WallSpeed if you wallrun.</p>\r\nImportant Mechanics\r\n<ul><li>Doing a walljump will slightly hinder your speed, preventing players from building speed via walljumps.</li><li>Some enemies respawn, and all enemies grant 2x points, but you lose 2x points if you get hit, to balance gameplay.</li></ul>\r\nPizza Time\r\n<p>During Pizza Time, gameplay changes to make the player much faster.</p>\n<p>You accelerate 1.25x as fast, walljump speed hinderance is slightly less worse,\u00a0\u00a0the timer is frozen to 1:01, and instead of losing 5 points per second, you gain 5.</p>\n<p>This mod is clearly not serious, and is just made for fun. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T06:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ed/3ed7c6897d17466341c0660a93a664cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Applemunch Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
