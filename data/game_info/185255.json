We did this under the umbrella of \"Kaka Productions\".\u00a0The theme was \"Hope\" and we created a game about a girl who was trying to overcome depression.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is a puzzle\u00a0platformer. Hope, our main character, had two different states of mind, that also dictated the extent of her abilities. When \"hope\"\u00a0is activated, our character Hope can jump higher, she can see new paths that she didn't see in her hopeless state.</p>\n<p>The game won 3rd place at the jam!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created in Gamemaker. All assets original.
