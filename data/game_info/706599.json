How will you choose to interact? Will you be <strong>ignorant</strong> and defend your <strong>microaggressions</strong> against other\u2019s cultural identities, or will you try to <strong>learn</strong> from your faults and embrace a new world of change?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In My Shoes is an <strong>interactive narrative</strong> created by Team Spacefrogs to create a learning experience on how to <strong>communicate </strong>with others that are different than you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We all have <strong>preconceived biases</strong>.
