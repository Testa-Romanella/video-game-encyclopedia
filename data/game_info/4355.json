The simplicity of the controls is overcompensated by the rich audio/visual experience presented within the game. Player\u2019s responses to a constantly changing environment shall have an impact on both image and audio. This creates an illusion of a player being simultaneously a painter of the current image and a composer of the music heard. In addition to that, each level in Kaleidoscope has a clear defined goal, which opens up doors of an infinite synaesthesia world to the masses. \r\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
