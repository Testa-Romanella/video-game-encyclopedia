{"id": 715577, "slug": "recurse-eternal", "name": "ReCurse: Eternal", "name_original": "ReCurse: Eternal", "description": "ReCurse: Eternal is a virtual reality sword-fighting single-player game that is combat-focused featuring only boss-level characters which will be fought one at a time as the player progresses from one stage to another. IT IS NOT AN OPEN WORLD RPG. The game's progression will work like traditional fighting games such as tower mode or arcade modes where you fight each enemy in a ladder-style progression. The actual combat is inspired by souls-like games that encourage strategic gameplay by punishing rushed and spammy movement and rewarding rhythmic dodging, blocking, parrying, attack patterns.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T02:52:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48cdbc7e64cce60ebb45f21bde813edd.jpg", "website": "https://www.recurseeternal.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceRex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["SpaceLab21"], "esrb_rating": null}
