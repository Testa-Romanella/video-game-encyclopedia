Well, everything, which I think fits the limitation pretty well. I feel this project is at a relatively complete and enjoyable stage, although much could be added to make it better. I'm not sure if I'll ever make a finished version of this, but feel free to give suggestions in case I do :)</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>All music, art, sfx, and concepts are made by me. Uhh thanks to religion for the concepts of heaven and hell I guess???</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T09:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a6/2a65c1192dcde0c2ff686efb26fef4dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["no context needed"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
