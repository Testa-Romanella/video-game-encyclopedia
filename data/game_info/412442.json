However, critical systems are down and the ship is on a collision course with a star! You have to go through the ship and repair core systems to gain access to the control room and save the ship. On top of collecting materials, you must be cautious and watch your oxygen, as all rooms need to have their life support restored individually. The loss of power means that exploring will be difficult due to the darkness, which can also be fixed room by room.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T05:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/322/322d124e20c22a4fe1d72e19c0c6a255.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["crav12345"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
