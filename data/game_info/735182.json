This game subtly brought to light the adverse and unforseen implications of a shifting climate, such as sudden sporatic changes in weather patterns.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>But there are ways to limit the spread of our damage on the environment, some methods which are catching a lot of momentum include upcycling tarnished clothing and the reuse of solid plastics. Limiting the rapid nature that our atmosphere is warming will help fight off a climate where with warmer temperatures, illness and viral transmissions are likely to occur in greater and greater numbers due to increased moisture in the air.</p>\n<p>Nonprofits directly combatting climate change can be found below.</p>\n<p>https://nextgenamerica.org/</p>\n<p>http://climaterealityproject.org/</p>\n<p>https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T05:04:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/582/58256695d8280a84d466c8d0cef4b088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adam Smith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
