If your score is ever exactly 70 or 71 then enemies will stop spawning. If you bypass that score, then the game will carry on without a problem!</em></p><p><strong>What is High Roller?</strong></p>\n<p>High Roller is an endless 2D-platformer-shooter that I made for GMTK Game Jam 2022 (My very first game jam)!</p>\n<p>Gameplay takes place on a single screen as hostile, sentient\u00a0casino chips keep appearing from the top of the screen and make their way down.\u00a0The aim is to defeat as many of the casino chips as possible while also surviving.<br/></p>\n<p>Every time you reach a certain amount of points you'll receive a dice roll. You get to choose whether to roll your own dice, or the enemies dice. The dice roll can result in both buffs and de-buffs for yourself and and the enemy so choose wisely!</p>\n<p>High Roller should support most game controllers, but a keyboard is essential for navigating the game's menus!</p>\n<p><strong>Who am I?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I am Connor Warrington, a recent university graduate in professional writing and game design! I'm currently working on my first full release, and you can follow development for that on my Twitter!</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/AloneGame7</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T17:16:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c0/2c0b530baa3b19e2dc63f0eac7e5fc89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["connor_warrington"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
