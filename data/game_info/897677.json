{"id": 897677, "slug": "sidewhip", "name": "SideWhip", "name_original": "SideWhip", "description": "<p>SideWhip is a short fast-paced competitive game made for the 2 Buttons Jam. The game has two modes, singleplayer and split-screen multiplayer. Player 1 can use the keys A and D to interact, and Player 2 can use the left and right arrow keys. A and Left Arrow are used for controlling movement, when you hold them down your player will move, and when you release the key your player will switch directions. D and Right Arrow are used for attacking. This will only work if you have vines in your inventory, which are collected by simply running into them. There are also random powerups that spawn in the middle of the stage occasionally. Hitting these will reward the player either increased vine spawns, an extra health, or disable the enemy for a brief duration.\u00a0Each player has 5 lives, and the first to defeat their opponent is the winner.</p>\n\n\n<p>Created by Frigid_VTX &amp; Flowoop</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:06:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1f/f1f520697db04e08f9c04987e236f0a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frigid"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
