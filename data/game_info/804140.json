From creating your own Mecha, to creating your own weapons, to other things. Sure, it isn't anything too fancy, but it's something I can call my own. I'm always willing to take feedback. This is just something fun for everyone to do.\u00a0<br/><br/>Of course, later down the line I'll probably update and add some things later on in the years. Let me know. I'm always willing to improve my stuff. :)<br/><br/>(The Cover Image is not mine.
