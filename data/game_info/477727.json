Left mouse pauses the game and right mouse un-pauses is. \"A\" on the keyboard will move the currently controllable ball left and \"D\" will movie it right. as the viruses start to spawn you can kill them by hitting them with the red ball (Anti-Virus) but if one of them touches the blue ball (Personal Data) the game is over. High score is saved and the goal is to get the highest score possible. the game over screen is a blue screen as tho the pc crashed. its meant to do that so don't panic. thanks for trying my game. I started a day late and finished a day early. took me about 24 hours-ish. I did record my screen through the entire run and will be uploading to YouTube after heavy editing.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:08:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/635/6351cbaf817fd1120860c6a0cac8a487.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nateLaw1988"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
