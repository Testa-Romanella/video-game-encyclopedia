In their haste to uncover its secrets and control its power, they reverse engineered their own box by siphoning out the magic and chaos. They created something new; Endora's Box. Rather than unleashing the chaos when opened, the subjects who open Endora's Box are absorbed inside where their souls are doomed to wander in an eternal void, or be corrupted by its power.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u25d8 Amazing bread parties\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\u25d8 Cooking lessons?\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\u25d8 Off the cuff one liners\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\u25d8 Lonely, needy computers\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\u25d8 Who let these ducks in?\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\u25d8 Absolutely no secrets at all...

Scott built Endora's Box in GameMaker Studio, but coded all of its systems from the ground up. His favorite part of working on the game is designing puzzles and the themes for the levels.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n<strong>Nichole Fredley</strong>: The art technician, in fancy speak, who makes the game look its best. She graduated Vanarts in 2012 and is equipped with the knowledge of animation and storytelling. Starting out as a writer at age five, she now enjoys any medium that lets her tell fantastical stories. Endora's Box is the culmination of her love of strange humor, interesting characters, and stories full of mystery and whimsy.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\n\r\nPrice:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe see this version as a short demo of a larger concept we have, so we made it free! However, any money you donate will go to coffee and working towards a complete version of the game. It might also probably pay for therapy for when we try to make a MAC port.\r\n</p>\n\r\n\r\nHow you can help:\r\n\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nWe've been Greenlit on Steam! Our next step is to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund the rest of development. We'll let you know when it drops. In the mean time, go check out our Greenlight page and tell your friends about this cool game you found!\r\n</p>\n\r\n\r\nContact:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tSend us an email at \r\n\tEndorasBoxGame@gmail.com if you enjoyed the game, want to know more about it, or maybe want to help work on it's future versions!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can also follow us on \r\n\tTwitter or Facebook, and keep updated on the game's development.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFeel free to post your experience on our forum, also please paste any error codes you find here.
