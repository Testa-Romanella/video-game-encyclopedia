Having mastered technology allowing them to thrive again, the people now living underground face new challenges from the outside with vicious creatures threatening their lifestyle. But also, and more importantly, from the inside. To what extent can technology really save their humanity? What are the choices and sacrifices one is willing to make to keep his or her lifestyle?<br />\nThose questions form the background of an adventure where you will explore a procedurally generated dungeon trying to survive long enough to bring back the energy required to further your explorations. What initially appears to be a simple quest for energy becomes less clear as the identity of the \u201cvolunteers\u201d exploring the world is questioned, forcing you - the player \u2013 to make choices that you might not have thought of before.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-15T12:47:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/794/794f507b430b4cb1e7f0312935574fb9.jpg", "website": "http://www.endroad.fr", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 210, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ENDROAD"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ENDROAD"], "esrb_rating": null}
