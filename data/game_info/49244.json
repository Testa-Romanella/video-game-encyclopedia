The game has black and white teams, like chess, but each team has different pieces and a different raison d'etre. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe white team has a total of 13 pieces, the most important one being Odin the King, who starts in the centre of the 10x10 board and moves in the same way as a chess King, whereas black has 20 pawns and four other pieces. White wins if Odin can reach one of the corner squares; black wins if it surrounds Odin on all 4 sides. The pawns actually move the same way as chess queens, but pieces are captured by surrounding them on 2 sides (although some special pieces must be surrounded on 3 sides). The specials are chosen from the selection at the start of the game, and have a variety of abilities, some 'borrowed' from chess.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe presentation of this interpretation is similar to Battle Chess, with bold 3D graphics and lots of animation.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbb/cbb8c4dc92ec61075e6aafbe83c99392.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 165, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Imagitec Design", "Imagitec"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Piko Interactive", "Ziggurat Interactive", "GameTek"], "esrb_rating": null}
