The use of vibrant colors and serene landscapes gives the user a pleasant experience.  Once the game is started, the player can select a ball color, change the length of their club, and choose from 4 different soundtracks to accompany their game.  Each hole features a sign on post that keeps track of the player's score.  <br/><br/>If there are enough players interested in the game, more courses will be released and the game will be further developed. <br/><br/>Enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc24de13b296602c23679bbc3e1cc45.jpg", "website": "http://www.lucidlife.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 133, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Isaac Stearns"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Isaac Stearns"], "esrb_rating": null}
