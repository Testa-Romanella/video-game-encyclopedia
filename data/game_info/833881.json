You have a vessel. It\u2019s not much of a vessel -  but it has a mining laser and you\u2019re short of cash.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It seems to be a perfect marriage. You mine rocks. You sell rocks. You mine some more rocks\u2026<br/><br/></p>\n<p>You are a lone hunter. You hunt  asteroids. You pilot your ship around a dense asteroid belt looking for  the sweet motherlode floating ore that will let you retire. Your biggest  challenge is the environment and piloting your vessel in that zero-g  environment. You will begin each journey from the starbase and drift  towards the asteroid field. At the start, you can\u2019t see any asteroids  until you approach them. You\u2019ll need to map each rock before you can  mine it with the mouse button. The more you drift and explore, the more  you\u2019ll see and map. \r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Find the asteroids, mine them, fill your cargo, return to base for profit. Easy.<br/></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Slow burn relaxing game</li><li>Float in zero-g space and make a small living mining rocks</li><li>Sell rocks and upgrade the vessel.
