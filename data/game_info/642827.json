Use \"S\" and \"D\" to move left and right and \"W\" to jump. (Pro tip: Holding a direction and jumping lets you chain wall jumps when in contact with a surface.) Your trusty pistol follows your mouse and shoots on a left click. Don't forget to press space to <strong>slow down time\u00a0</strong>to pull off hard jumps, dodge bullets, or even shoot bullets with your own.</p>\n\n<p>Also, a big thanks to the artists that made the music in this game:</p>\n<p>Main Menu Theme - \"Submersible.mp3\" by\u00a0\u00a0Xylo-Ziko\u00a0</p>\n<p>Level 1 Theme -\u00a0 \"Run\" by\u00a0Andrew Codeman</p>\n<p>Level 2 Theme - \"Untitled\" by Samuel Rose</p>\n<p>Level 3 Theme - \"Neon Lights\" by\u00a0Nirikin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T09:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ca/5cac46b961e6bb67159bf09683a5b263.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NewKid"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
