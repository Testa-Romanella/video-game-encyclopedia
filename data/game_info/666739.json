The jam theme was \"Into the Machine\" which I tried to represent as the player's ship exploring the twisting insides of some unknown machine, but it also inspired me to put a little 'Tron' spin on it visually.</p>\n<p>The game ended up a little different than the original concept but I am really satisfied with the gameplay. Try it out and see what you think. I had hoped to add more varied enemy types and rooms to shoot it out in, more variety in the levels, and more weapons. But it's a Jam and it is what it is. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>The game has been tested on Windows only but Mac and Linux versions are available. Please let me know if you find any issues with these. There has also been little time for optimization so it may not run well on lower end hardware.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:56:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c424d47044fd3508716fc32116b919e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pintail"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
