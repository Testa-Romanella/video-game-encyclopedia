Score is 2-2. All Depends on You.\u201d<br/></p>\n<p>The purpose of the game is to sneak to the opposite goal, among a bunch of opponents. The closer you are, the better are your chances to score. Beware of not getting spotted on the way. Allies may show up and help but remember, you have a limited number of passes. In the worse case, you still can RUN!</p>\n\n<p>This game has been presented to the game jam contest Ludum Dare #41.\u00a0 The imposed topic was \"Combine 2 incompatible genres\". This game is a mix between a classic soccer game and a stealth survival game.</p>\n<p>Enjoy !</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Made by :\u00a0</strong>Julian\u00a0\u00a0<strong>&amp;\u00a0</strong>\u00a0Julien\u00a0\u00a0<strong>&amp;\u00a0</strong>\u00a0Leonaaard</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85b/85bc86e228dff561882f346d48de88aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GamingNight"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
