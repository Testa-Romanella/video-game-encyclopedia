An idea by Daph Blake based on the classic Blitz it tries to keep to that 1983 style.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is simple: using the space bar fire missiles at the icicles above - you must clear ALL ice to win! You can only fire one missile at a time and each time you loop the screen you get one step closer to an icy mess!</p>\n<p>If you do manage to clear the ice and escape you are given the option to go again to get the highest score you can.</p><p>Thanks to Rose Tinted Spectrum for the loading screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:41:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fd178db891c5753c4aeba75038bebc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jim Blimey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
