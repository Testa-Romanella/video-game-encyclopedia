{"id": 861448, "slug": "public-land-hunter", "name": "Public Land Hunter", "name_original": "Public Land Hunter", "description": "Public Land Hunter is a retro hunting simulator that let's you hunt on procedurally generated maps and grow your hunting camp with additional hunters, weapons, animals and perks.<br/><br/><strong>Procedurally Generated Maps</strong><br/>Each map in Public Land Hunter is procedurally generated. You'll find yourself hunting dense fall foliage, breezy summer clearings and sparse winter fields. This provides you with a unique scouting experience for each hunt, requiring analysis of the satellite map and looking for sign on the ground before setting up your ambush.<br/><br/><strong>A True Deer Hunting Experience</strong><br/>With the procedural maps and the realistic deer AI, hunting requires strategy and an understanding of deer patterns, all of which are explained in the games tutorial.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Animal Variety</strong><br/>Hunt rabbits, grouse, ducks, pigs and deer, with the potential for more animals in the future. Each animal has its own patterns and AI. Rabbits roam the fields, grouse need to be driven from the tall grass, ducks are called in, pigs roam the woods at night and deer follow realistic patterns between bedding, water and food in the early and late hours.<br/><br/><strong>Speed Up Time</strong><br/>Public Land Hunter features the ability to fast forward time in order to keep your hunts fast and exciting. While sitting in a treestand or a hunting blind can be relaxing when in the wild, no one wants to sit for hours waiting for a deer when playing a video game. The fast forward mechanic allows you to get right to the action once you're set up for an ambush.<br/><br/><strong>Build Your Hunt Camp</strong><br/>Grow your hunt camp with additional hunters who specialize in different animals and weapons. Complete their tasks to unlock perks and additional hunts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Arcade Mode</strong><br/>Public Land Hunter also features an arcade mode, where players can experience a truly retro experience and go after high scores that will provides even more unlocks.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T06:53:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2cc8029d71507c9a36c9c6f3332c706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toft Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Toft Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
