With the sunlight from outside as the only source of light you must use mirrors to direct it around the level, searching for resources and the path down to the next floor.</p>\n<p>Please consider trying the windows version as it works much better and is experiencing fewer lighting bugs.<br/></p>\n<p>Unity's 2d lighting is still in experimental so there may be some glitches with the beams of light. Salvaging and then replacing a mirror or disperser can often fix the problem. The lighting system is also not well optimized yet so later levels can get quite slow on web.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:16:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/385/385d210b3eea21825c0f3d8948d7e8cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sisyphean Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
