ALIVE!\r\n<p>Greetings creation! It is I, Dr. Frankenstein's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dr. Stu\u00a0 Pendage, MD. If you are reading this, then eureka! The literacy brain implant is working. Also I am dead. But before I died, I poured my blood, sweat, tears, and kidney into creating YOU, my beautiful monstrosity.</p>\n<p>Now, the local villagers probably won't take too kindly to seeing someone as beautiful as you, so if you see a big group of them fetching pitchforks and swords, turn and run the other way. Oh, also your limbs will probably deteriorate over time, so you'll need to do some upkeep- maybe tear off an arm or leg no one's using and slap it in the ol' socket. That's about all you need to worry about: death by an angry mob or the rapid decay of all your limbs. Other than that, I only ask that you go out there and LIVE, my child!</p>\n<p>With love,\r\nDr. Stu Pendage, MD\r\n</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>Move - W, A, S, D<br/>Pick up limb - Left Shift<br/>Attack - Spacebar</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming and Sound Design - Dylan Sundberg<br/>Programming - Erik Sundberg<br/>3D Modeling and Animation - Ryan Sundberg<br/>Music, UI Graphics, and Story - Kris Sundberg</p>\n<p>This game was made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 46.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef7/ef704b852aff47e6c46771882fef5864.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erik Sundberg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
