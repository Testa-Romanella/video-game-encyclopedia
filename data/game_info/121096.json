It was written in a very short space of time for a competition, but I've since added a set of achievements that should provide a decent challenge for anyone wanting to collect the lot.</p><p>Use cursors and the Z key to play, or an Xbox 360 controller.<br/></p><p> Avoid the red enemies, and eat the small green plankton to grow.</p><p> After 5 plankton have been eaten you can enter Rage mode and turn the tables on the enemy for lots of points.</p><p> However the more plankton you eat before Raging the higher the multiplier gets, leading to super high scores.</p><p> Raging clears away most of the growth you gained, but not all - you're always growing...<br/> <br/> The game features a bonus mode called Facemelter. It's the same game but just picks a new random eye-watering colour-scheme from a selection for each phase of the game. If flashing colours do bad things to you then you really want to stay away from this one. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b4/9b4b6d18cf0214cb2902ed9e9dc5c079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BearcatGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
