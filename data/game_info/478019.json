Created for<strong> Brackeys Jam 2020.2: Rewind</strong>. Control three characters (farmer, ninja, samurai) with different move sets and abilities that let you reach different areas, and evade or fight monsters from Japanese folklore, so you can collect the light orbs to rewind the sun!</p>\n<p>Made in 7 days with Unity 2019.4 and Game Creator by gypynkt (Sebastian Graetz), with original music by <em>Tunglith</em>. I started with learning Unity and game dev less than four months ago, so the scope was way too large on this one. I did not manage to fully finish all the mechanics, enemy behavior is not properly developed, there is no health system or fail state at the moment. Also there are no enemies in the later part of the level... and so much more that needs work. A little hint for one area because it's a bit buggy, and I didn't have time to set explanations up in game: <strong><em>The farmer needs to ground-pound onto the trapdoor in front of the castle gate.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>I'm intending to get it fully functional after the jam, so any feedback is appreciated<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>AD to move\u00a0</strong></li><li><strong>Farmer: Space to jump, Space mid-air to ground-pound<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Ninja: Space to jump, Space mid-air to double-jump<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Samurai: Space to attack with katana<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Alt+F4 to quit the game ;)</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T05:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81b/81bc9ef417bf0510599defff8107ed27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gypynkt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
