I call it Clocker. I made it because I figure those Face Masks for the prefabs were pretty scary. Very scary, so basically it's about some spheres with the face mask textures following the player. The most of all face mask texture I thought was so Hideous, was the one with the teeth and the three eyes, Disgusting!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T04:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de1/de1a9d42ec8b22b8310ff988c4cd1ec8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jahsi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
