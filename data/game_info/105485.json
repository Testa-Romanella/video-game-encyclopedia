Not while there's an unbarred window and an inattentive guard. She's going to retrieve her fans, and if she happens across some other valuable items in the process, well, who could blame her for defraying her expenses. It's not stealing ... it's all Entirely Respectable.</em></p><strong>Features</strong><ul>\n<li><strong>Turn-based </strong>- take it one step at a time.
