All rendering done in Unity Engine with High Definition Render Pipeline. The effect is achieved with a custom made raymarching render engine with ray distortions that greatly emulates real world physics. The volumetric accretion disk around the blackhole demonstrates how light rays follows the bent space time and allows the camera to view places inaccessible by normal perspectives.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: <em>F key</em> to toggle control HUD/GUI.<br/></strong><strong>Showcase Video: </strong>Link<br/><br/> <strong>This\u00a0is\u00a0planned\u00a0to\u00a0become\u00a0the\u00a0main menu\u00a0background for video\u00a0game\u00a0REDO.\u00a0More\u00a0information\u00a0about\u00a0REDO\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0found\u00a0here.</strong></p>\n<p>Please join the\u00a0discord server and post a screenshot of the visualization with HUD enabled to help me determine the best graphics settings for this simulation.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T06:55:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a5/4a577e4907899c3e36eea008477ea58a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MMXXXVIII"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
