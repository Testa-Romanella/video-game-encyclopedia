I\u00a0have an overactive imagination and when my anxiety spikes my mind starts firing on all cylinders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0usually have\u00a0 nightmares and this was one of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have tried various ways to get thoughts out of my head and this is the first time that I\u00a0have successfully created some form of art using my mental illness as fuel and as a narrative.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0am not really good at anything. I'm not a great artist or writer but I\u00a0can imagine things so apologies if grammar is incorrect and the lack of images in here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0did create the cover though and \"Worthless\" is not spelt wrong, I\u00a0just didn't realize how close to the edge I\u00a0was.</p>\n<p>On a positive note, I'm proud of myself for even completing this project. There are no images, just text, but I\u00a0haven't completed anything in years so this is a win for me.</p>\n<p>I hope you like it.</p>\n<p>Please give me some feed back if you think this is something I could pursue as I\u00a0am reaching my ropes end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have a patreon account and any donations will go to me being sane.</p>\n<p>There is reference to bodily harm and blood.</p>\n<p>Ryan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T07:50:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae5/ae5849fb703562f164a644735a95ee4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ryan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
