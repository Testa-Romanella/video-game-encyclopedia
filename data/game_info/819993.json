Defeat your enemies using this divine power!</p>\n\n<p>Rules:</p>\n<p>Each turn you have to choose where to move and the power of your attack. The higher the numbers you choose, the faster the scale on the right side of the screen fills up. If enemies kill\u00a0you or the scale fills up before you kill all of them, you lose.
