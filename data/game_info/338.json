We say different.<br/><br/>Nine deeply unique and deeply flawed individuals have been chosen for greatness. Heroic, noble, enlightened... Just 3 of the many words they can\u2019t spell. They will set off on an epic journey that will turn them from zeroes to almost heroes. Or dead people. More likely the latter.<br/><br/>Join these 9 zeroes on a quest to become heroes in an ancient land. Train them to learn battle skills, magical powers and which end of a sword is the business end.<br/><br/>In AaH you\u2019ll find quests, secrets to unlock and there&amp;#39;s lots of clicking to do. Yup, it\u2019s a clicker game.
