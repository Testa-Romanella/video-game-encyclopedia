Welcome to Rogue Wild Tactics\u2019 world.</p>\n<p>RWT is a strategic game in which you compete against another player to become the king of thieves in a world that, otherwise, would live peacefully without your intervention. The map lives automatically, and you must beat your enemy in a one vs. one bloody fight to get the most points you can.</p>\n<p>After every day the game will automatically check how many resources every player has stealed. There are three resources, for each one of these one of the two players will be granted a point. After six days, whoever has the most points wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Commands</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left Click</strong>: interact\r\n  </li><li><strong>Right Click + Drag</strong>: Move across the map\r\n  </li><li><strong>Mouse Wheel:</strong> zoom-in/zoom-out</li><li><strong>F1</strong> and<strong> F2 </strong>will activate and deactivate the HUD and UI in game for a better and clean view</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The flow of the game is divided into <strong>three</strong> phases: <strong>day, dusk and night</strong>.\r\n  </li><li>During the <strong>night</strong> you can buy bandits with <strong>money</strong> (displayed on the upper right part of the screen). \r\n  <ul><li>You can have 4 bandits in you gang\r\n  </li><li>To place the bandit click on a legal tile (bush glows when a bandit is selected)\r\n  </li></ul></li><li>During the <strong>daytime </strong>the bandits will act following their specific behaviours\r\n  </li><li>During the <strong>dusktime </strong>the map will change and the points will be calculated.</li></ul>\n<p>For more infos check the in-game tutorial.\r\n  </p>\n<p>ROGUE, WILD, TACTICS, GO!</p><p><strong>TEAM\u00a0DI SVILUPPO</strong></p><p><strong>Game Designer</strong></p><p>Tommaso Ferrero (Project Manager)<br/>Guido Meo (Lead)<br/>Emanuele Carbonara<br/>Sebastiano Italo Caradonna</p><p><strong>Game Programmer</strong></p><p>Amedeo Cuttica (Lead)<br/>Paolo Brogni<br/>Roberto Macetti<br/>Luca Manuel Orsoni</p><p><strong>Concept Artist</strong></p><p>Francesco Giglio (Lead)<br/>Sara Francofonte<br/></p><p><strong>Game Artist 3D\u00a0</strong></p><p>Matteo Domina (Lead)<br/>Daniele De Giglio<br/>Andrea Hoxha</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T12:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a0401a156cee88bfca6d8021d933155.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Bros Game Academy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
