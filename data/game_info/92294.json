Scan targets to gather intel, and once you've got a clear enough picture, arrest them. Try not to arrest the wrong person, it's expensive to cover up.</p>Controls<p>You have access to the the sophisticated <em>Orthographic Reception Watch and Eliminate mk. II</em> monitoring device. With it, using a simple command interface you can spy monitor and act upon threats.</p>Commands<p> scanScanning is the core method to identify threats. Due to the nature of the act, however, it's somewhat limited. Scanning a person gives you their entire call history and automatically adds them to the tracking list if they are deemed a threat. Otherwise, they'll be added to the ignore list</p><p> track Tracking lets you observe someone without spending our resources! If you suspect someone but don't want to scan them just yet, you can monitor them to see if they call a known suspect, or to turn off existing tracking.</p><p> arrestOnce you're pretty sure about someone, you can arrest them. Make sure it's the right one. You will be able to watch the dispatched officer pursue them and upon arrival, you'll be able to see the results.</p><p>ignore Toggles the ignore flag. Useful for cleaning up the map.<br/><em>Note that scanned targets that are not suspicious will automatically be added to the ignore list.</em></p><p>help Useful in case you forget how to use these commands.</p>Tools/Frameworks/Etc<ul><li>Phaser.io</li><li>alexei/sprintf</li><li>Music by Bensound</li></ul>Links<ul><li>Trello Board (Planning, what's that?)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/938f0117309e698bc681e7a714f3fd0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zambini"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
