Each shape has its own unique shrapnel pattern, which can hit other shapes in a chain reaction and subsequently increase their point values.</p>\n<p>Touching an enemy or a piece of shrapnel will make you lose 1 health point (HP). The game ends when you've lost all your HP. You start with 3 HP and they regenerate automatically as long as you don't take damage. Dashing can help you pass through enemies and shrapnel without taking damage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T02:48:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebe12c42103d9b03918ac84efcbd6992.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["M.S.T.O.P."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
