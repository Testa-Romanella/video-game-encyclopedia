They avoid the thought of graduating through a series of mini-games including starting up an illegal gambling ring and fighting god.</p>\n<p>Initially explored through 3 thematically different prototypes in a Game-A-Week intensive drawing from my own bittersweet experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>High School Was A Breez</strong><strong>e!:</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>A simulation inspired by bored class drawings visualising the drifting detached sensation, emphasised through soft body physics, against overwhelming social and academic expectations. The protagonist was supposed to have an anchor-like mechanic, allowing interaction that will ultimately completely ground them.</p>\n<p><strong>Chemistry:\u00a0</strong>A looping visual novel immortalising my memories of a sun-kissed chemistry class and a sleeping friend. I wanted to explore this relationship through small snippets of this afternoon class and encourage audiences to fill in the gaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Last Lunch:</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>A role-playing game that celebrates the mundane. Find your friends before lunch ends whilst being constantly interrupted by Pokemon-inspired silly random encounters - including a boy you like. Other interactions that were cut include stealthily hiding from your teacher and fighting your way to the front of the canteen line.</p><p>Currently in development\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T19:23:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96d/96d286dc303c5b7d612b0e519d66ed13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Althea Francisco"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
