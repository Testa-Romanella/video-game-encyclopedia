There is no lore; the story does not matter. There is no long-winded campaign. The moment you enter the arena, it is ON.<br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Aggressive combat design </strong>where you take what you need from your enemies. Shoot a robot to get health, or melee it with your buzzsaw to recover ammo.<br/></li><li> <strong>Movement, movement, and more movement</strong>. Run along walls, swing from monkey bars, grapple through the air, launch from jump-pads, and more.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>5 weapons to wield</strong>, each with <strong>special alt-fires</strong>. Discharge your shotgun backwards to fly into the air, fill your assault rifle with more juice to give it more power, or create devastating waves of energy that slice through opponents.<br/></li><li> <strong>Online leaderboards</strong>. Compete with your friends to see who can get the highest score.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Modify each run using a unique <strong>pick-your-poison shop system</strong>, where every purchase changes the rules in absurd ways. Want to upgrade yourself? Gotta buy a few downgrades first.<br/></li><li> An original soundtrack created by the developer himself that floods the soundscape with distorted synthesizers and low-tuned guitars.</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T07:46:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39bb7f2f27c0ab443e13845b904be08f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Gurj"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Gurj"], "esrb_rating": null}
