There is really a lot of work because our gates are open during the day and night. <br/><br/>In our hotel, everyone is welcome: with sunrise we welcome people and with sunset our door opens for vampires. This is for security, because we do not like each other too much ... unfortunately, there are cases when they come to us and tease in inappropriate time what causes the dissatisfaction of the guests. In this case, pick up the garlic or other bogeyman and show culprit his place! <br/><br/>But do not forget your main responsibilities!<br/><br/>You have to prepare the rooms, take out the garbage, take orders, give orders; clean up the table ... you cannot keep up?
