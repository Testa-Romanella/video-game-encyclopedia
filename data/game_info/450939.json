She is mute and without her means to communicate with her strange neighbours gathered in the hallway to find out what's going on, but a mysterious entity offers her a voice.</p>\n<p>Find the janitor. Get a spare key. And get back to safety. With dialogue cards!</p>\n<p>During the Corona quarantine I created a few small game prototypes to experiment with\u00a0story driven games.
