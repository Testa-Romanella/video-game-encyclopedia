It's a serious game about spreading rumors and framing others to get to the one you love.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I had this concept a while back vaguely based off the experimental\u00a0game Gossip (1983) for the Atari. When I heard the theme for Ludum Dare 43 is Sacrifices Must Be Made, I thought I could mix these two concepts together to make this strange game.</p>\n<p>For this project I\u00a0used a custom editor tool that I\u00a0created called the Story Graph. It's a visual scripting tool that allows me to easily make events,\u00a0coroutines, and functions and be able to visually debug my code (instead of throwing a bunch of debug.logs everywhere). I plan to release it on the Unity Asset Store soon!!</p>\n<p>For whatever reason I thought that I could animate everything with co-routines instead of the Timeline or Animation window, so it looks a little janky. While it did save me a lot of time in certain places, it definitely made it harder in others.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ca/2ca4d59535c356995833b2785f9e23eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mattwagar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
