I'd never used Renpy before this project, so a variety of things are rough around the edges, but nevertheless, I'm proud of what I've accomplished in a short time limit and am happy to have had the push to finally attempt a VN of my own!\r\n</p>\n<p>I do have stories in mind for these characters beyond the scope of the game, but I didn' t have a lot of room to detail,\u00a0so\u00a0I tried to work with vague suggestions.
