In this current build, there's only one route to take in the beginning, which takes about a minute to complete (There's really not much at all in this game, I\u00a0spent all my time scripting and drawing lol).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I might turn this into a full game at some point, which multiple routes and character relationships and such, but at the moment this is all I got done. You can quit the application at anytime by pressing \"Esc\".</p>\n<p>This is the most work I've put into a 2D game, both scripting and graphics, so feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:26:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f1/0f1c4f0fe6abf926a6aedd25a693c6e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LAT46"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
