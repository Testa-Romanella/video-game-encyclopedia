This is the result of a few hours over an evening.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your goal is to get through the horde of Ghasts and make your way to the portal to vanquish evil and save the farms! You have a gun, they have magic... let's do this!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Right click to move to the mouse location, hold to keep moving.</p>\n<p>Left click to fire bullets in the direction of the mouse cursor.</p>\n<p>Scroll down to zoom out to see the whole level and Scroll up to zoom back in. Careful though, it may scroll your page. Oops.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Collect Turnip Cats to regain health and avoid being hit by magic fire or toughing the Ghasts.</p>\n<p>There is some janky collision I haven't put the time into sorting out (something for another day) for the water and fences that I wanted. They're more of a hinderance. Phase through them if you like but in the spirit of the game I'd suggest using them as boundaries.</p><p><strong>Assets</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The pickup art was created for me by the\u00a0lovely @spectissa for my Twitch channel. The Ghast, Ghast Fire, Portal and an unused asset were made by me within Construct. All audio effects were created by me with the exception of the music which was created by\u00a0DARK FANTASY STUDIO\u00a0and purchased with a royalty free license.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br/></p>\n<p>While feedback is always appreciated, I know how janky this game is and what needs improved on. As it was just a quick hands on with some game dev software I've never used before to give it a go, I feel it's not too bad for just a few hours of work figuring things out by myself.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>And with that, I hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>~Sarah</p>\n<p>(Sometimes Jolly | TriSarahBoops)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T10:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b306bc6b62128655c46afe61a63fb769.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sarah"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
