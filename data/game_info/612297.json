Most of the work done so far has been establishing the scripting engine which utilizes several resource file formats I've developed over the years for use in a variety of DOS / Pre-Windows 2000 games. There are several screens currently included and a handful of game specific text blurbs and parser commands. Writer's block has seen fit to intervene for the time being, but perhaps once I'm passed it the Aching will become the fleshed out game it deserves to be.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T07:16:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/510/5101c7966d2a608cb46814526ad66e18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheLobdegg"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
