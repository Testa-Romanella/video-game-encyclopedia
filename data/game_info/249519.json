Later he found out that he was gonna clone himself and take over the world! sonic rushed to action avoiding obstacles and more! on the way there, knuckles helped distract eggman to slow him down and now sonic is soo close! Can he make it...? - 2012 Me</p>\n<p>This game may be really bad, and difficult because of its mediocre-ness, but it IS beatable. On the last level, there seems to be no way to beat the stage, HOWEVER... If you stand and do nothing, Sonic will teleport to the end of the level! This was unintentional, but it was a glitch that helped beat the game. So yes, this game is complete. Enjoy this heaping pile of trash everyone!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e1/6e1bc99d07becf397ee7581ec5487379.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroLord120"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
