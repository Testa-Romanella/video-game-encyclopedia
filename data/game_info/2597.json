Each of them has unique abilities and their own inventory. You can also create your own character. You play as a part of the party that needs to destroy the Ring. Besides the story mode, there is a free roam mode where you can explore the open world of the game switching between two characters.</p>\n<p>The game keeps the balance between environmental puzzles based on LEGO mechanics, QTE-fights and exploration. Different actions are more suitable for different characters. The game features multiple collectibles, side quests and unlockable heroes.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2012-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T09:29:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/89a/89a700d3c6a76bd0610ca89ccd20da54.jpg", "website": "http://www.thelordoftherings.lego.com", "rating": 3.53, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 375, "owned": 4416, "beaten": 362, "toplay": 76, "dropped": 194, "playing": 29}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 118, "ratings_count": 589, "suggestions_count": 542, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 593, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "Nintendo DS", "PlayStation 3", "Nintendo 3DS", "Xbox 360", "Wii", "PS Vita", "Android"], "developers": ["Warner Bros.
