You might feel like you are being watched while playing: many scientists are observing your every move.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>In order to succeed you must arrive to the end of each level: when you do so, an orange door will light up. Once you reach the exit, a new test room will wait for you, until you will eventually discover what\u2019s going on in the lab.\r\n</p>\n<p>You will find out that you can stop time at your will. When you use that power, you will be able to beat object, and they will respond to your input and they will move accordingly when you\u2019ll make the time flow again. Beware though: your power comes at a price! When the time flows again, you will be frozen instead and unable to move, until you use your power again. In a nutshell, when time moves you don\u2019t, when you move time doesn\u2019t.\r\n</p>\n<p>You will find different objects inside the test rooms, so you will need to think thoroughly in order to complete the levels.\r\n</p>\n<p>The highest amount of force won\u2019t necessarily be rewarded: aiming your hits will often be the key to solve the puzzles. But often timing is key: stop time when the moment is right to use platforms or to climb on boxes and you will unravel the mystery.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>More information at:\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/polimigamecollective\r\n</p>\n<p>http://www.polimigamecollective.org\r\n</p>\n<p>http://polimi-game-collective.itch.io\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/652/652666d98a940a3a45661dbe9f318bc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
