Tilt your iPhone or iPod (in the manner of grandma after her annual sherry) to catch them in Santa's sack. For each one you catch, you'll score points. Get hit by a falling bauble, however, and it's twelfth night.<br/> <br/>We created Jingle Bells because Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without a little bit of fun. Once you've opened all your presents, finished the Christmas pud and gently tied together your snoozing relatives with tinsel, Jingle Bells will keep the jollity going.<br/> <br/>From the trusted SunCat Software brand, makers of iPubquiz, which made the iTunes top ten in its category, and Crash Zone, the popular New-York driving game iPhone/iPod app, Jingle Bells is a one-player iPhone/iPod app that tests your festive reflexes.<br/> <br/>Just load up your iPod or iPhone, tap the Christmas-present icon, click play and we're off. You are Santa Claus. In front of you is a Christmas tree; in your hands, a large pressie sack. Tilt your iPhone or iPod to catch the pressies. You'll score 100 points for each one. But get hit by a falling bauble and it's game over. Once you've been baubled, you can compete against other players by uploading your score to the global leaderboard.<br/> <br/>Jingle Bells is a delightful slice of festive fun that uses a built-in accelerometer to give it that extra bit of playability. It's also far more entertaining than the Queen's speech. What's more, it's FREE. So what are you waiting for? Download Jingle Bells today.<br/> <br/>And if you're buying someone an iPhone or iPod for Christmas, why not load it up with Jingle Bells and add to the merriment?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/821/821669b053e453eeaedc94a8673c41c0.jpg", "website": "http://www.suncatsoftware.com/apps/6/jingle-bells.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Tom Callaghan"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Tom Callaghan"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
