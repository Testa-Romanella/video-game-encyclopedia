Retrieve it by hitting all gnomes with cake.</p><p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong><br/></p><p>You will see a box on the floor indicating your throwing direction and origin. Press and hold <em>MOUSE1</em> to load up your throw and wait until your target tile is marked. Then, release <em>MOUSE1</em> to throw. Throwing the cakes is tile-based, and you have limited range, so don't waste any precious cakes! On impact, the cakes' explosion will spread to each adjacent tile (kinda like bomberman!). If a Gnome is hesitating to come out of a corner, try scaring him out with your party horn (<em>MOUSE2</em>)</p><p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p><ul><li><strong>W,A,S,D or Arrow Keys</strong> : Move</li><li><strong>MOUSE</strong>: Aim</li><li><strong>press MOUSE1</strong>: Load Cake</li><li><strong>release MOUSE1</strong>: Throw Cake</li><li><strong>MOUSE2</strong>: Use Party Horn</li></ul><p><strong>Java 8</strong> required to play!</p><p><em><strong>Update 0.1.1</strong><br/></em></p><ul><li><em>Fixed issue on Mac and Linux that was caused when the \"Arial\" font was not installed</em></li><li><em>Improved performance of the confetti particle effect</em></li></ul><p><em><strong>Update 0.1.2</strong></em><br/></p><ul><li><em>Fixed an issue with the shadow boxes blocking the \"winning\" spotlight</em></li><li><em>Adjusted the cooldowns of the \"cake-throw\" and \"partyhorn\" ability</em></li><li><em>Implemented the possibility to skip the tutorial text by hitting \"SPACE\"</em></li><li><em>Added the \"partyhorn\" ability to the hud</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/6670b44788db51ca93ed561eb33d48c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["gurkenlabs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
