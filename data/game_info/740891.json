Play through the questions asked to Mr. Broad on the Trash Taste Podcast and see if you can help him find true love. </p>\n\n<p>It's a visual novel so not much to explain. The boys will ask you questions and depending on your answer certain members will gravitate towards you more than others. Once you reach the end, go back to the title and try to get a different ending.</p>\n\n<p>Also this game is basically a giant shitpost and should be treated as such. It's a big joke and in no way represents the real people involved.\u00a0If this offends any of them I'll take it down.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T09:36:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/951/951957aa7f25b4d67c1a3ca85d471f15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["jackrockstar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
