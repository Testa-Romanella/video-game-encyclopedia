Plants are composed of 3 different parts (stem, leaves and flowers). Each part\u00a0 modifies the behavior of a plant. Flowers determine the area that gets affected by pollen, pollen becomes toxic and kills the affected plant unless both plants share the same stem. Leaves give bonus points if neighboring plants share the same leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Members</strong></p>\n<p>43ther - Programmer &amp; Game Designer<br/></p>\n<p>Precious - Artist &amp; Game Designer<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assets Used</strong></p>\n<p>https://www.1001freefonts.com/es/8-bit-operator.font</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mhr5sxeZtQw<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/doorajar/sounds/427074/<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Mattix/sounds/399210/</p>\n<p>https://jonas-tyroller.itch.io/wowie-pack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T05:31:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a2f50a5e39fde321a3bba0ec1c5b14a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["43ther"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
