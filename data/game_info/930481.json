The theme is Makeshift.</strong></p>\n<p>After a long night gaming you find yourself waking in an unknown land, as you try to find your way through the mysterious halls you discover a gigantic beast and it doesn't seem friendly....<br/></p>\n<p>This is based on a game that was originally created in 3 hours for TriJam 203 with the theme Break the Cycle. Realising it fit the boss rush category I decided to continue development and submit it to Boss Rush Jam as the rules stated a game could be submitted to mutliple jams as long as it was created during Boss Rush Jam. TriJam 203 took place during Boss Rush Jam.<br/></p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Move - WASD/Left Stick</p>\n<p>Play the game to find out the additional controls!<br/></p>\n<p>The game supports both keyboard+mouse AND controller.<br/></p>\r\nTROUBLESHOOTING\r\n<p>If you have trouble with controller UI prompts, try closing Steam. I've found sometimes games that haven't been launched through Steam will treat the controller like a mouse which messes with the game's controller detection.</p>\n<p>You can play the original TriJam entry for free on itch.io!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T18:26:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/6935b4069700bf6a0487bd14cd90a772.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Drentsoft Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
