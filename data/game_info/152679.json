From talking sticks to moon-worshipping hares, you'll never know what you'll find in this wacky 2D game!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Version - 0.1.3</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>0.1.3 already? What happened to 0.1.0, 0.1.1, and 0.1.2?</em></p>\n<p>Good question. Through the development of Astro, we had 2 different versions. They weren't so good, so we created a third version. This is the one you see now. (It's a less than average answer, but it's true.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>[We also consider coming up with the ideas as a version, we don't know why either.]</p>\n\n<p>(Note: Game is in such an early state, you might as well give this game a new development state known as \"This isn't even a game yet.\" Everything is subject to change, and this game may or may not be worked on. It depends on how well it goes. Nonetheless, we hope you enjoy it.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/233/233d4d6068fee8d9c5a08c4e93659ce3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["McLyntree"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
