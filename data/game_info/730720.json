In the day mode, time progresses in the span of weeks, and you must spend the money you have collected to increase your reach, unlock new villages, and invest in villages to earn a passive income.</p>\n<p>Sadly I spent too much time on the night mode, and thus did not have time to complete the day mode, thus it is not included in the build, but a screenshot it include to show what it would look like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T08:55:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adf/adff58c39a0f9ccd7c29002289c3bcec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MoJoE"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
