Works also on your mobile, to relive the true feeling of the Tamagotchi. (Could also be perfect in an arcade cabinet with 3 big buttons ala Pop'n Music ^^)</p><p>If you can't bear my incredible SFXs, press \"M\" to mute.</p><p><em>Made by Mysterarts in 1 week for Oujevipo Contest #2 : KIDS</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b6/1b6d260ed511d395a7c8b520f26f4091.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mysterarts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
