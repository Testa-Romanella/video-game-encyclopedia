The aim for each level is to kill all enemies before they kill you, however you only have one shot. You must think carefully about the enemies pathing and movement in order to line them up correctly before you take the shot.</p>\n<p>Enemies use A* pathfinding so they will always take the shortest route. Extra skills can be unlocked along the way, and as well as one shot you also have a 1-use ability which will freeze time for 5 seconds, allowing for a quick escape if you become trapped.</p><p>Once you have killed all of the\u00a0enemies, make your way to the finish platform at the right side of the map to complete the level!</p>\n<p>This was created by myself for the Games Jobs Live Game Parade summer 2021 game jam. The theme was: One time use.</p>\n<p>All music used in One Shot was created by myself within the given week.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:01:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b38/b3895ec4944dbef2cd3ee271e0e0a6e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Lister"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
