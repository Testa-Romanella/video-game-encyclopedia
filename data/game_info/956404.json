Inspired by Quake, Wolfenstein, and games of that style. This is a demo and is currently a work in progress. I'll be updating it here soon with more levels, a new weapon, sensitivity settings, and\u00a0more features! In addition, I'm hoping to add at least a local multiplayer component in the future!</p>\n<p>For now, let me know what you think!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Disclaimers: Level 4 is currently an unedited level, and is simply the same as level 1, as that is my template for the rest of the levels. This is still a demo so some features may not work as expected.</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to \"Sample Text\" for creating the asset I used for this project as my framework!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:24:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea6/ea60e670713057ff21ca0849bb903307.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grahamcracker25"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
