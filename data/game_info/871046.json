If that reaches a full moon, then the man turns into a werewolf and the level restarts. The blocks on the right are draggable, so you can drag them\u00a0 into the level to deflect the laser. On the subject of lasers, if you double click the cannon, the laser will activate. Deflect the laser into all three of the potions to beat the level.</p>\n<p>If you beat the game, you get access to a level selection and a level creator! The level creator isn't very polished right now, but here's how it works anyways -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left and Right-click give menus to blocks and potions, which you can click to place. Be careful, once you place a wall, you can't move it, and the only way to get rid of it is to restart by clicking the menu and going back into the editor.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T13:24:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42f/42f1df1aee5df816601f4f026843ee7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheEPICArt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
