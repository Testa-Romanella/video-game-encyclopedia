Mistakes damage you.\u00a0<br/><br/>You can see remaining enemy health in the battle screen, player remaining health is in the top-left of the screen.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Bringing Level Health (found in the top right) below zero before your Player Health is reduced to zero,\u00a0advances you to the next level. Level health is reduced when enemies are killed, not on damage to the enemy. The Level Health is reduced by the amount of health a fully healthy enemy has.\u00a0</p><p>Be careful around corners!
