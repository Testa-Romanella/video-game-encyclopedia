I was too lazy to add a lot so I just added 5. The game is a bit hard but its perfectly fine! Make sure to watch my videos and Subscribe to my channel. I made this game for 2 days so it might be a bit bad. Thanks for downloading. I forgot to mention that this is based on the tutorial Brackeys's made. Make sure to sub to him too. In the near future I will add a new first person parkour game(FPP). Thanks again!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:31:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a6/8a64207f81707e1cb750910db094c1dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MigzPlayz"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
