So, to generate a blast, just touch any place on the screen. The distance and the angle of the Fart Blast will determine how and where the Captain moves.<br/>there are 60 levels each level you complete will unlock the next level. You can go to the Level Select Screen at any time. From there you can select any unlocked level to retry and improve your Star Poop Rating.<br/>Watch out for the air freshener sprays, toilet rolls, pooping cats, pooping geese, and more. And don\u2019t slip on a pile of poop, unless you can use it to slide in the right direction!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d8/9d8f7b3ca212d11bb583ef7419a52b02.jpg", "website": "http://www.terrymillerassociates.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["John Miller"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["John Miller"], "esrb_rating": null}
