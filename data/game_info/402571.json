It also praises\u00a0the superb artistic talent of Rob McCaig, author of the\u00a0said book\u00b4s illustrations. Thank you chaps for your work\u00a0contributed into making me what I am.</p>\n<p>Grave Digger Ex is a turn-based strategy game where you\u00a0have to escape the sematary unscared. While doing so,\u00a0\u00a0vandalize tombs and disturb the undead as they might still\u00a0be carrying values, but beware of time, find the gate key\u00a0and run before it\u00b4s too late. Your trusty shovel can brake\u00a0tombs, hit the undead and dig holes, use it very wisely.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Play:<br/></strong></p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Notable Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Super tense soundtracks by Gundatsch\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/gundatsch</li><li>Eternal amounts of procedurally generated Semataries</li><li>19 unique red shirt/blue jeans zombies (if the Hulk can,\u00a0\u00a0so can we)</li><li>4 peace of mind restoring potions</li><li>5 infamous treasures to be found</li><li>No hud, life measured by player\u00b4s stress animation</li><li>Ability to dig 6 holes</li><li>Ability to hit zombies and cause chain-bounce-back dominoes</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Joypads:</strong><br/>A - hold to withdraw shovel + directions to dig and hit<br/>B - skip turn<br/>Directions - move<br/><strong>Keyboard:</strong><br/>Z - hold to withdraw shovel + arrows to dig and hit<br/>X - skip turn<br/>Arrows - move<br/>Esc - Return to title / Quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T01:55:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de82c5955dce498f9547c45faba47a4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FUED"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
