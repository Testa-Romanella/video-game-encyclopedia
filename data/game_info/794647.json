However, each time you press a key, its control will change to another key on the keyboard. With both players on the same keyboard, you must reach over your opponent's hands to reach your keys, whilst also trying to block them from reaching theirs. And remember, you don't need to press your own keys.</p>\n<p>A three-person team created this game for a final college project.
