{"id": 602244, "slug": "dragon-ball-z-super-saiya-densetsu", "name": "Dragon Ball Z: Super Saiya Densetsu", "name_original": "Dragon Ball Z: Super Saiya Densetsu", "description": "<p>Super Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/anime series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets.<br />\nThe game follows the rough outline of the Vegeta, Namek, and Frieza Sagas, with various add-ons and edits to make the story fit within the RPG guidelines, such as the inclusion of multi-colored Saibamen and re-colors of Frieza&#39;s henchmen and the Ginyu Force members as common enemies.</p>\n<p>The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters&#39; attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Super Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T20:43:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2f8/2f874999f8be8fd6af42a8eeb22880f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 56, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Tose"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Bandai"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
