You are a blue house cat with a stretchy head. As aliens have invaded, you are our last defense against their hordes. Fight the aliens on earth, under the ocean and in space in this fixed shooter inspired by old arcade classics.<h3>Arcade style</h3><br/>They came from another planet is a risk/reward based, arcade style shoot 'em up where you fight aliens by shooting at them (from your ears). Killing an alien results in falling stars that you collect to level up and get stronger. You can stretch your head to collect more stars, but beware, stretching makes you an easy target for the invading force.<br/><br/>Stars also give you points. Points are useless but fun. You can also get to write your initials on the high score table if you have enough of them, just like in the arcades.<h3>Reckless and rich or safe and poor</h3><br/>I you are hit, your head will split and have to connect before your life meter runs out. Leveling up by catching more stars is crucial in order to survive longer when split. In the end, it's up to you how you like to play. Reckless and rich or safe and poor.<br/><br/>Sometimes the aliens also drops a power up to help you on your journey.<br/><br/>Power ups include:<br/><br/>Speed up<br/><br/>Fire rate up<br/><br/>Double shot<br/><br/>Spread shots<br/><br/>Missiles<br/><br/>and more...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T05:37:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfd/bfdaad19e0900ac534676e4ffd6a51ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lillmagnus", "Magnus Fredriksson"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bortbyting"], "esrb_rating": null}
