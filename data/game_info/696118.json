The most interesting thing about this story is that it gives the user an opportunity to choose what to do next. I feel that the pictures are matching with the passages and the audio and background music. And most of all I\u2019m happy that I was able to add a GIF since I\u2019m a beginner so it was a bit hard for me to add it to my story. After numerous struggles, I was able to move the pictures, the text in the center, and I\u2019m happy that it looks good enough to be presented. There are many other things that I wanted to do to make my story more interesting. The background music is good but I think it could\u2019ve been better because it is essential to a story and gives life to the story. I changed my story, the options many times and even replaced a few pictures. I feel that the story could become better if I could add transparent background images so that they would blend in with the background of that passage. I struggled with the background music because I was not able to play it\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T06:00:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/971/9710243c14d353649a05a1d31c58f649.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["warshiah"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
