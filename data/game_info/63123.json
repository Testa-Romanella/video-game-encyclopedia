Gravia is a first-person action puzzle game centered on the concepts of black holes, and gravity. In Gravia, you have the power to create small black holes in the area around you. These black holes pull in and destroy almost everything in the environment, including yourself. You'll use this power to destroy obstacles, solve physical puzzles, defeat enemies, move massive object, and move yourself at very high speed. You can even bend the path of laser beams.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main game mechanical in Gravia involves the use of the Gravia Glove. This glove fires a small, fast-moving projectile in a straight line away from you. When it hits something, the projectile instantly transforms into a small black hole, pulling in the objects around it. You also have the option of converting the projectile into a black hole in mid flight. In most cases, you also decide when to destroy the black hole, which immediately stops the gravity effect. Careful and controlled use of the Gravia Glove will allow you to move yourself through the world, reaching places you could never reach simply by running and jumping.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBlack holes are extremely dangerous, and it's very easy to kill yourself accidentally or destroy things around you. Much of the challenge of Gravia comes from performed controlled actions with a tool that is anything but subtle. On the other hand, most of the environments in Gravia are designed to be highly destructible, as there's a special joy that comes from watching the world fall apart around you. Most large, destructible objects in Gravia bend and deform as they are drawn into black holes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGameplay typically alternates between challenges that require pure problem solving skills, and those that require speed and timing to proceed. As your mastery of the Gravia Glove increases, you'll develop the skill to move through areas without ever needing to touch the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGravia has a rich, linear storyline that takes place within a high-tech research facility called `Gravia Technologies.`", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/0601ae8c22b680af39d87c7302e8b5f6.jpg", "website": "https://www.graviagame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 330, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dan Goyette"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Self-Published"], "esrb_rating": null}
