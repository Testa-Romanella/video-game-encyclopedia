After the corona pandemic forced me to shelter in place away from my college friends, I missed them very much. I decided to make a short, funny game that takes place at my college. <br/></p>\n<p>Even if you are not one of my college friends, you should still enjoy the game; I hope. Take a chance on me?<br/></p>\n<p>Obviously, as this game is very short, uses default assets, and is not going to win any awards, I have set the pricing to \"$0 or donate\". I only want your two cents, either in the comments or as a donation. :)</p>\n<p>I believe this will be my only RPG Maker game, at least for a while. I am going to explore the Unity engine now and hopefully make something even better!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Ethansito<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T03:12:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/668/668d12c38c79abe2a4cd5c1390d1802b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ethansito"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
