This is an alpha version of the game and may contain bugs and other errors.</p>\n<p>INFO</p>\n<p>SUICIDE MISSION is a third person stealth shooter like the Metal Gear Solid series. The game follows a child soldier, fighting for his country against a foreign invasion.</p>\n<p>There isn't much content right now since the game is in early development. More missions, locations and weapons will be added later. Right now, there is one mission which is playable from start to finish. The point of this alpha is to convey an approximation of what kinds of missions will be in the finished game.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>R - Reload weapon</p>\n<p>C - Tap to crouch, long press to crawl</p>\n<p>V - Change aim view</p>\n<p>SHIFT (HOLD) - Sprint</p>\n<p>LEFT CONTROL (HOLD) - Walk</p>\n<p>1 - Equip Pistol</p>\n<p>2 - Equip Rifle</p>\n<p>RIGHT CLICK - Aim</p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK - Shoot</p>\n<p>TIPS</p>\n<p>AIM FOR THE HEAD to instantly kill enemies. If spotted, kill the enemy before he calls for backup.</p>\n<p>CRAWL EVERYWHERE. Long press C to crawl. Crawling reduces visibility greatly. Crouching helps too but not as much.</p>\n<p>Don't make noise near guards. Hold Left Control to slowly and silently move around. Crouching and crawling are silent. The pistol is suppressed but the rifle isn't.</p>\n<p>Save ammo when possible.</p>\n<p>Bodies can be pushed around and hidden by moving into them.</p>\n<p>During an ALERT phase, backtrack while sprinting. Then crawl behind something.</p>\n<p>Don't go underwater.</p>\n<p>Try to get a high mission ranking. The highest rank is \"S\".</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>Game by Jumping Triangle (JasonAI).</p>\n<p>Music and ambience are from Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 3.
