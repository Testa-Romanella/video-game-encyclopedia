It is also inspired by the gratuitous violence in many modern videogames, which almost never has real consequences. And lastly it is inspired by The Old Man and The Sea by Ernest Hemmingway, one of my favourite books.</p>\n<p>I wanted to see if I could expose the significance of actually killing something, and the consequences of death that videogames rarely try to cover. I wanted to see if I could make the player feel regret for murder. I also wanted to make a game in Scotland because most of the Scottish developers seem to want to make games set in America.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/169/169c76789366be8fe6e92ed376b4e611.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joebain"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
