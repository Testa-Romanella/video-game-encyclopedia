{"id": 500486, "slug": "hoigi", "name": "Hoigi", "name_original": "Hoigi", "description": "<p>Hoigi is a two-player Board Game played on a nine-by-nine board similar to Shogi. Unlike the other similar games, Shogi and Chess, Hoigi incorporates an exciting third dimension to the gameplay allowing the players to make more maneuvers and develop new strategies which require a completely new way of thinking.</p>\n<p>Hoigi introduces a new mechanic called \"tiering\", stacking up to 3 pieces, which provides better mobility options for the units. Tiering produces entities called towers, with a maximum of 3 levels, a tier 1 tower is just a piece on its own, a tier 2 is one piece stacked upon the other and a tier 3 tower are 3 pieces stacked upon each other. Alongside with this mechanic it has a few others that are predominant in Board Games: movement, capture and dropping (placing new pieces).<br/>As in Chess and Shogi, the goal is to trap the King so it cannot escape, but this is preceded by strategic maneuvering of pieces which are meant to control space and strengthen the final attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Important information:\u00a0</strong>In order to unlock more features such as \"Save Replay\", \"Save Formation\", \"Play Online\", or support for different languages we encourage you to try the<strong> Google Play</strong> version which is linked below.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This game has been inspired by the fictional Board Game \"Gungi\" from the manga/anime \"Hunter x Hunter\" written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi, but because the rules are different that makes them two different games.</p>\n<p>Here is a link of the detailed rules for the people who need to translate them in their own language:<br/>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u39hwJCRrQdtU5hAL3NLziOZR9HxvxlktshbX0kehms/edit?usp=sharing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T07:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/952c99211bcdc6a8b9988ad6fb88151a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GahijiTech"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
