There are a variety of puzzles I laid out as an experiment just to see how much potential the idea has.</p>\n<p>Basically, it's a brief experiment!</p>\n<p>Made in about 12 hours.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T23:41:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4da5cebbae4e86d8e0ae1240e18f6b75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt \"Game Dad\" Dyet"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
