Earn money, find souvenirs and buy upgrades for your gondola.</p>\n<p>The idea came from real life trash cleaning with a gondola. The game was made by 2 friends and some help from a musician in <strong>Gamemaker Studio</strong>. It was a summer project and took around 3 months.\u00a0We promise to update the game and bring some new additions to it in the future. An android version should be coming until the end of the year!</p>\n<p>We hope you'll have fun playing\u00a0<strong>Collector Service!</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>If you encounter any bugs or glitches, make sure to let us know!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:29:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caa/caaa75da64b01499ffbc3b7277bec1ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ma31n"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
