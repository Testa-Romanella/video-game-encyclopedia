With your skills and newly granted overreaching privileges, you can access numerous confidential records on essentially anyone. Browse medical records, phone logs, browser histories, and social media to learn everything there is to learn about your suspects.<h3>Background</h3>The game takes place within a fictitious world, quite similar to ours, but with a few key differences. As crime rates are on the rise, a private agency called RE:Solver has sprung up, giving new power in the field of digital forensics. They aid law enforcement around the world by diving in and dissecting the case inch by inch, bringing a fresh set of eyes and vital information to the people in the field.<br/><br/>Nothing will stop a member of RE:Solver to get to the truth. Not rules, not privacy concerns, not ethics.<h3>Gameplay</h3>Use the tools given and dig into every corner of the lives of the suspect. Collect phone records, credit card transcripts, daily habits, and more through the Emerald Network. Browse the game-internal internet for missing people, public records, social media, and more.<br/><br/>Once you have a strong case, you may file them and hope you put the right person behind bars.<h3>Production</h3>This game is based on a series of investigation tabletop roleplaying one-shots written and conducted by Nils Munch during the Covid-19 lockdown. A great thank you to all the players and playtesters taking place in building and polishing up this game.<h3>Creative liberty</h3>While the world seems much like ours, all suspects and the criminal cases you are solving are a complete work of fiction, and any resemblance to any real individuals, living or dead, are purely coincidental. All characters portrayed are generated electronically, and no real people are displayed inside the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T04:25:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c96/c96d82694db0f5a04a12ab5bcce66471.jpg", "website": "https://resolvergames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LizardFactory"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LizardFactory"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
