It\u2019s kind of worn down from all the years, so take good care of it, get cozy in your armchair, play some tunes. Just don\u2019t hit the wrong notes, okay ?</p>\n<p>I've made this game for the Brackeys Jam 2020.2 and it's the first game I've ever created so any and all feedback is greatly appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>First greatly appreciated feedback is that I messed up the WebGL build settings so it has to be played in fullscreen and I have no idea how it will look on other resolutions. Have fun though !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:54:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52beb0ccbecc9a18feef3f61ff4ab6fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HardCodeBoys"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
