It features real people and facts, but the overall story is fictitious.</p><p>The year is 1830 and the Concert of Europe is meeting once again.  At their meeting, the leaders discuss the fact that the Netherlands never really plays much of a roll in their meetings.  This angers the leaders, so they invent Belgium, a country that would rebel and gain independence, thus taking land from the Netherlands.  They call their plot for revenge the Belgium Conspiracy, since the country itself is created by the government as part of the plan.</p><p>This was originally made for AP Euro.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea6/ea63df52a7fd30383b4ededdcb7edfe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steven Miller"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
