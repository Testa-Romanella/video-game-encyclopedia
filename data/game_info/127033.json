The simulations are extremely realistic. A couple of noteable features are shown here:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Water has the property of cohesion.</li><li>Each particle of water is processed individually.</li><li>All objects have, though a very small amount, have gravity, just as they do in real life.</li><li>Fire realistically interacts with gas (oxygen).</li><li>Fire releases a small pressure wave when it burns slowly, giving a realistic explosion simulation.</li><li>Slow motion offers a way to accurately simulate physics of any scale with minimal lag.</li><li>The program is easy to learn and use.</li><li>Tons to do and many things to features to mess around with!</li><li>The camera can be move around freely to get a better view of the area in which you are running the simulation.</li><li>Multiple pre-built simulations are included to get you started and to introduce you to the program.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f82/f82133d9dda56b1e9cda857bd839131a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["V0LT"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
