Then, I\u00a0realized the word Pandemonium was a synonym! I immediately wanted to make a game about a panda, and the theme of balance came to mind. As for where the main time-slowing mechanic came from, the movie Kung Fu Panda 2 was the primary inspiration behind it's execution - where you can catch incoming projectiles and throw them back. I then decided to make the game about conservation, though I wasn't able to include all of the references to the theme that I had hoped.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T23:40:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f59/f592b31c58cf4bad7bb34a8bd78ec0c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GipMedia"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
