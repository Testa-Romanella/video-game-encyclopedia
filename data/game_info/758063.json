Race against time to capture wandering souls and use them to revive all the hidden skulls of each level. Each level has a new challenge - spikes, acid, moving platforms, deadly bats! Run, jump, break blocks to release skulls and get coins. And remember: the Devil is always willing to trade some souls in exchange for more time!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T12:13:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/59714d630e33f9e415c687dc407e602c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["H.Lano Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
