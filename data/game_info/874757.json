I have no data on the last.\u00a0</strong>\r\n&gt; Preface\r\n<p>Hotdogs are quite fine cuisine, ain't they? (yes, say yes)\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game blurs the line between life and death, and heaven and hell. What really is afterlife? Can't it just be a bunch of hotdogs falling out of the sky? It can! I think...\u00a0</p>\r\n&gt; Description\r\n<p>Parkour, watch the replay of the run, manipulate speed of the things in the replay, eat hotdogs. Done.</p>\n<p>Honestly, this is a redemption for my previous game (https://yummypk.itch.io/u-only-get-one-ball) which I couldn't playtest on time until now, and is still technically unplayable past the first few floors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hence, there's no game over in this game! If you pause, you can see your stats, from number of jumps to accuracy, all there! Screenshot if you like, and send them\u00a0to me at discord [\u00a0<strong>Ken-chan#4079\u00a0</strong>]\u00a0if u want\u00a0hehe imma beat yo ass.</p>\r\n&gt; Gameplay\r\n<p>1. Parkour through the course as a runner with double jump. Once you reach the end, your run is saved as a Replay. This Replay plays back whilst you watch from the clouds afar, as a ghost.</p>\n<p>2. During Replays, hotdogs start repetitively slowly falling out of the sky, spawning on predetermined areas (marked by the rotating cubes in the air).\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. The runner in the Replay should be touch these hotdogs to eat them. (weird wording, I blame the world) Eaten hotdogs will never spawn again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. As the ghost watching the Replay, you have the power to manipulate time in two ways:\u00a0</p>\n<p>(a) shoot the hotdogs to speed them up temporarily [effect and duration stacks]; and</p>\n<p>(b) slow down the runner in the Replay by half its speed.</p>\n<p>Use these to perfectly eat the hotdogs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>5. Once the Replay ends and there are still hotdogs remaining on the course, you return back as a runner in (1) to reattempt the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>6. Progress of eaten hotdogs are saved; and you have unlimited attempts and mistakes/falls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>7.\u00a0A level is completed once all hotdogs are gluttonously consumed.</p>\r\n&gt; Credits\r\n<p>- Game Icon: Roblox Hotdog -<br/>https://www.roblox.com/badges/968272941/hotdog-meme<br/></p>\n<p>- Low Poly -<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/products/hot-dog-g06</p>\n<p>- Low Poly Clouds -\u00a0\u00a0<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/products/low-poly-clouds-pack-1</p>\n<p>- Low Poly Water -<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/lowpoly-water-1075...</p>\n<p>- Sci-Fi Handgun -<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/sci-fi-handgun-225160<br/></p>\n<p>- Crosshair -\u00a0<br/>Crosshair icons created by Freepik - Flaticon\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Font: Klender DEMO -\u00a0<br/>https://www.dafont.com/klender.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T07:42:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4ade50c8283dc536093003e70c4ee10c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yummyPK"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
