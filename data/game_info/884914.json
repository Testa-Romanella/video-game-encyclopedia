While rhythm and many other types of games heavily incorporate music and sounds, this is always on an aesthetic level, where the game can be played without sound, based on visual cues or timing.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project was to create a series of prototypes and an accompanying zine that demonstrate our own approach to musical mechanics and to answer the question 'can you create a game that can't be played without sound?'.</p>\n<p>This is a digital version of our in-person exhibition.\u00a0 Please refer to the zine while playing through the games for the best experience.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Our Games:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Midiban:\u00a0 Note Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Push notes around,\u00a0 and try to match a melody. Each note is a block\u00a0 that can only be pushed into a free space. The grid allows the player to change both the note and when the note is played.</p>\n<p><strong>Barrow: Compositional Recognition</strong></p>\n<p>Explore an ancient barrow\u00a0 and connect objects to a skeleton to find its true song. Objects play snippets of music, which alongside a full song, are used to if an object belong to the skeleton.</p>\n<p><strong>Punk Manager: Recognising Changes in Tempo</strong></p>\n<p>Run an unruly punk band that always ends up out of sync. When members get too slow and thirsty, throw them a beer to speed them back up, likewise throw a joint if they are too fast. Try to time your throw through the crowd.</p>\n<p><strong>Synth Wizard: Keyboard Chord Playing</strong></p>\n<p>Using a mystical keyboard (a midi keyboard controller) to banish the bad vibes. Cast Spells by playing chords on a keyboard and get past obstacles by using the correct spell and timing. Listening is used to determine enemy weakness to specific spells.</p>\n\n<p>Created as a final honours project\u00a0for the Digital Arts Department of the University of the Witwatersrand by Juliette Love (music &amp; sound) and Jack Rathbone (game design and programming).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T05:54:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f68/f684260f2794a1826f5bcb92eaef7edd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Juliette Love", "Jack Rathbone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
