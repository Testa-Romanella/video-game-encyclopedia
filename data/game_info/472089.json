You play as Russell, Linda, and Joan \u2014 son, mother, and grandmother \u2014 switching between them to help the family cope with a series of traumatic events. Based on a true story.</p>\n<p><em>Prologue: \u201cFour Months Earlier\u201d</em> is part one of the story.\u00a0Part two, the main Linda &amp; Joan game, is coming in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>[Learn more about this project at lindajoan.com]<br/></p>\n<p>Linda is visiting Russell in Los Angeles, where he now lives. We join them halfway up a hiking trail. You must walk them to the top. Linda is using a stick and is unable to move as quickly as Russell. Keep them within earshot and they\u2019ll chat about Linda\u2019s visit and the past, while trying to find the right time to bring up what\u2019s weighing on their minds.</p>\n<p>There are multiple endings based on the choices you make \u2014 one of which involves Joan, who is at home in Hereford, UK. Play in <strong>Normal Mode</strong> (walk Russell, Linda follows) then try <strong>Challenging Mode</strong> (walk both Russell and Linda).</p>\n<p><em>\u201cFour Months Earlier\u201d</em> is a free, standalone experience. It will take 15 to 20 minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>Featuring original music by Jeremy Warmsley.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2ad77160ea874dfc5be7067dd0cb32b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["False Vacuum Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
