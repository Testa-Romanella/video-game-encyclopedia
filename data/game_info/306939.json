Born with hydrocephalus, a brain condition that calls for the need to install a brain shunt, Marvin deals with physical limitations and unexpected events. Around him, a wide range of characters, real and imagined, aid and challenge him in his journey to publish his first story. Alternating between melancholic and heartwarming moments, On Fighting Shadows wants to make you smile, feel sadness, and become aware of the invisible battles that thousands of people face on a daily basis.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bf/6bff0b8afed3e7fd96cf70c0577c5163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["rleon"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
