Learn new skills at home on your home computing device.</strong></p>\n<p>Groceries are costing more these days. Everyone knows it, so what're you gonna do about it huh? You steal of course!</p>\n<p>Join our main character in his quest to survive and conquer a world where just the cost of living is unattainable. Argue your way out of sticky situations with new tactics, and sneak through your weeks worth of food for an affordable cost.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD: Move and Rotate</li>\n<li>SPACE: Action Button</li>\n<li>E: Open Inventory</li></ul>\n\r\nTheme\r\n<p>As this was a game jam submission, there was a theme. This jams theme was <strong>duality.</strong> If it wasn't obvious, one of the major themes is the classic \"Man vs. Machine.\" The first idea that came to mind for me was the idea of cost vs. affordability, good vs. evil, a slightly lofty idea on duality: a dual economy. Thievery being one of the branches.</p>\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE\r\n<p>The HTML 5 version has a bug where one of the clerks will battle you infinitely on the second level. It\u2019s \u201cClark.\u201d If you\u2019d like to play the game in full in its (still buggy) glory, I HIGHLY recommend the .exe windows version. It\u2019s still buggy but a little less.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T11:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ba/4ba5777293a1f5ec367651b7bf4eca8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["nelsondev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
