The user plays as a kid trying to survive going to school by dodging and defeating hordes of bullies. The game gets harder over time and the goal is to survive as many days as possible using an arsenal of paper airplanes, apples, and soda bottles as weapons.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2019 hosted around the world. I spent 48 hours in a team of 4 members, where I worked as the main programmer, to create this game under the theme \"What home means to you.\" This was my first game jam and I was pleasantly surprised with the game. It turned out very challenging and was fun to replay, although it did have a few bugs remaining.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T05:31:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12b/12be605b724cbcd0be98353ab554a490.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Flamboozle"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
