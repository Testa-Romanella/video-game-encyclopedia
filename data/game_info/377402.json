They're not smart animals. Either way a shepherd would count this way and when they got to 20 they'd make a mark on something, or put a stone somewhere or move their hand on their crook.</p>\n\n<p>Some counting methods are still in use currently, the welsh method listed here is the base-20 counting method, like using \"Score\" instead of 20. Modern welsh doesn't use \"un an ddeg\"\u00a0 (one and ten) in everyday language, instead \"un deg un\" (one ten one). <br/></p>\n<p>There's plenty of modern languages which still count in 20s rather than being decimal, ironically French is known for this with Quatre Vingt et Dix (Four-Twenties and Ten) being 90. <br/></p>\n<p>Also it's totally true that some traditional numbers are kinda funny. Check out \"Borrowdale\" style counting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I assume that \"Dales\" refers to Yorkshire Dales and \"Lakes\" to the Lake District. Also personally I wouldn't doubt Wales has far more ways of counting than just saying one is Welsh but yorkshire has a bunch haha. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T05:29:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f68/f685b932705137397941ea07f8c24d1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maz"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
