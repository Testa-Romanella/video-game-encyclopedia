Want to do that to some lofi hip-hop music? Well, I've made the game for you. So chill out, grab some coffee, and set the game to fullscreen for the best experience! On mobile, there's a white square anchor to aim so you don't have to reach to the top of your screen on a big phone. Have a great rest of your day! :)\r\n\r\nAsset pack:\r\n- Generic RPG pack - https://bakudas.itch.io/generic-rpg-pack\r\nSongs:\r\n- anbuu, Florent Garcia - Hayride https://chll.to/ba57db0f\r\n- Aves - Everyday https://chll.to/c971695c\r\n- Ben Bada Boom, Magnole - Indifference https://chll.to/f1714b6c\r\n- Blue Wednesday, juniorodeo - Find Yourself https://chll.to/eda116ad\r\n- chromonicci - Afterglow https://chll.to/fdcc31db\r\n- dryhope - Zero Point https://chll.to/0c9f6b86\r\n- Emapea - Chilling at Last https://chll.to/e84fb83f\r\n- Evil Needle - Tendre https://chll.to/53fdcf8f\r\n- fantompower - The Birds will Leave Soon https://chll.to/a2ae95d2\r\n- J.Folk - No Worries https://chll.to/7a577747\r\n- Leavv - Downhill https://chll.to/08bf9e1b\r\n- less.people - Beautifully So https://chll.to/f9ecc446\r\n- Mama Aiuto - Power Plant https://chll.to/b602a639\r\n- Masked Man - It'll Always be Alright https://chll.to/c5cc13eb\r\n- Middle School - Dishes https://chll.to/7e7e645b\r\n- Molly McPhaul, Enluv - In Between https://chll.to/f8ca98c8\r\n- Philanthrope, mommy - Shakshuka https://chll.to/d9fdaf2a\r\n- Psalm Trees, Chico Balbin, Kristoffer Eikrem - Whales https://chll.to/a68786ce\r\n- Ruck P - Green Valley Trail https://chll.to/0fe74317\r\n- Screen Jazzmaster, Zmeyev, T.Check - Lush https://chll.to/77cc517e\r\n- Stan Forebee, Inf - Maple Leaves https://chll.to/77c5b7ff\r\n- Teddy Roxpin - Highland Park After Dark https://chll.to/276ba751\r\n- Tesk - makemesee https://chll.to/0524b822\r\n- The Doppelgangaz - Moules Frites https://chll.to/183abeec\r\n- \u00d8DYSSEE, Blumen - Lookaway https://chll.to/00c2f848\r\nAlso, if you have a few dollars to spare or even just coin clunkin around in your car, please consider donating.
