There is a man holding on to the sword who will flop behind it as it moves. Your goal is to defeat the other players by hitting the man holding onto their sword while defending the man holding on to your sword. This game supports both controllers and mouse and keyboard input.<br/><br/>Versus:<br/><ul><li>Fight against your friends or the AI in local multiplayer versus mode. Use stage hazards and power-ups scattered across some of the many stages to get the upper hand in a fight.</li></ul><br/>Co-op:<br/>Play solo or team up with your friends in one of two cooperative game modes. <br/><ul><li>Arena: Fight endless waves of enemies and earn gold which can be used to buy cosmetics. <br/></li><li>Campaign: Play through the campaign chapter by chapter. Chapters will be released periodically and the story will continue with each chapter.</li></ul><br/>Customize your sword man with a host of different weapons and cosmetics that can be unlocked through game-play. Damage is physics based, meaning heavier weapons will hit harder, but aren't as agile.<br/><br/>Sword Mans features a completely original soundtrack designed to fit the varying stages.<br/><br/>Content will be continually added in periodic updates including new stages, new cosmetics, and new chapters to the campaign.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21e/21e0a765d1c8066f078fa64a36b893e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bypass Game Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bypass Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
