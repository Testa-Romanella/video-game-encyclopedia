This brand new, competitive fighting game brings a breath of fresh air to the\u00a0familiar comfort of classic fighting games. K1LL-C0DE was born out of a love for over-the-top, anime-styled\u00a0fighting games and a deep appreciation for the vaporwave movement. This unlikely mix of genres takes players on a brand new experience unlike other fighters they might have played.\u00a0Team Hoola developed this Beta Demo in a total of 10 weeks with a team of 9 developers.</p>\n<p>TEAM HOOLA:</p>\n<p><strong>Grace Tuohey-Kay</strong> (<em>Producer</em>), <strong>Abraham van Overbeeke-Costello</strong> (<em>Testing </em><em>Lead</em>), <strong>Matthew Lovetere</strong> (<em>Lead </em><em>Designer</em>),<strong> Eli Wakeling</strong> (<em>Designer</em>), <strong>Leah Peterson</strong> (<em>Artist</em>/<em>Animator</em>), <strong>Stone Eaton</strong> (<em>Artist</em>/<em>Animator</em>), <strong>Clementine Hassouni</strong> (<em>Lead </em><em>Programmer</em>), <strong>Gavin Lechner</strong> (<em>Programmer</em>), <strong>Charlie Kowalski</strong> (<em>Programmer</em>), <strong>Alex Fellerhoff</strong> (<em>Music </em><em>Producer</em>)</p>\n\n<p>What Is K1LL-C0DE?</p>\n<p>The year is 198X. Corporatism has run rampant around the world, Countries are no longer bound by governments, but by corporations who would do anything to make a quick buck. The planet\u2019s resources have been dried up and humanity is left on the fringe.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Amidst the corporate world's domination,\u00a0the expansion of virtual reality technology sky-rocketed as\u00a0users looked for ways\u00a0to escape life's pains and to move into a new world less populated with greed and moral bankruptcy. Enter K1LL-C0DE, a game where everyone can be a hero; finally, you can regain control and\u00a0be the\u00a0leader of your own destiny-- all it took was\u00a0\u00a0a little bit of effort on the\u00a0daily. K1LL-C0DE was originally developed as a homesteading simulator to give their users a virtual ideal of land ownership, a reality that shattered when the corporates took over.\r\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately K1LL-C0DE\u2019s pure intentions weren\u2019t fated to remain uncorrupted for long. An armistice pact between the corporations was formed as a way to prevent more damage to earth's population. However, the pact left a loophole. Corporations could send their best users to fight within K1LL-C0DE for their organization's interests. As more cash was poured into solving their differences, K1LL-C0DE's\u00a0userbase shifted, and the vast\u00a0fields once populated with virtual homesteaders became just as deserted as the lives they were trying to escape.\u00a0Cyberspace warriors, hungry for power, fame, and fortune, now wonder K1LL-C0DE, graveling at the chance to represent the companies throwing the most money at their problems and training for the day they come face to face with their maker. In this battle of corruption,\u00a0who will you represent?\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T09:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f2/9f28718e17bd6dffa1b2b3282bef6c8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2ecat"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
