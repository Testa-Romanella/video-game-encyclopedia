Explore Leeroy's devilish manor and find a way to escape while being hounded by a spooky presence. Leeroy's dogged determination to hunt you down may be the death of you!</p><p>Leeroy's House was created for a Free Lives 8 hour jam. Inspired by Free Lives' resident canine Leeroy Jenkins, we followed the theme of \"Spooky Happenings at Leeroy's Manor\". We used assets from the Unity asset store, and sounds by Kevin Gibson and Jason Sutherland. The amazing Leeroy portraits were painted by members of the Cape Town game dev and creative communities.</p><p>Controls:<br/>WASD: Move<br/>Left click: Interact/press<br/>Right click (&amp; hold): Zoom in to examine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fa/9faf805b0ef13dbbffd41b00b3f401a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jem Smith"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
