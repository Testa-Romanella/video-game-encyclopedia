However, for an extra challenge you can sit at your keyboard alone and control both characters at once. It\u2019s tricky, but it can be done!<br/><br/>Can I play online?<br/>We wanted Putty Pals to be a pure, old-school couch co-op game, so we designed it for two players to enjoy sitting side-by-side. We don\u2019t feel that online play creates the same sense of shared playfulness, so Putty Pals is local co-op only.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/389/389df9e85d6f0f63f44f9410a988ac65.jpg", "website": "http://harmoniousgames.com/putty-pals/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Harmonious Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Harmonious Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
