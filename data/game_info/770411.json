This one I'm pretty sure I\u00a0won't try again in Godot, there's plenty of Megaman hack/fan games out there, I\u00a0don't know what innovation could I\u00a0bring to the table, aside from my interpretation on how the missing link between classic and X would be, but that's story stuff, not gameplay.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys : Move (DOWN to crouch UP for firing upwards)</li><li>A: SHOOT</li><li>S: JUMP</li><li>D: DASH</li><li>NumPad ( . ) : Change character</li><li>NumPad ( 5 ) : Use special weapon</li><li>ENTER: Menu</li></ul>\n<p>BUGS:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Frame rate would be wonky depending on your machine (I didn't knew about gameplay being tied to framerate until way later when I\u00a0played Bugthesda games :P).
