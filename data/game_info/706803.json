The current build has 3 maps, 10 weapons and 1 game mode, Horde. Choose a weapon and try to survive an ever increasing swarm of zombies. Can you last long enough to clear the horde completely? Replenish ammo at the ammo crate found next to your trusty RV.</p>\n<p>Difficulty can be customised by changing the amount of bites you can suvive before a game over. The zombie limit can also be adjusted to help with difficulty as well as performance issues older pcs may experience\u00a0when large numbers zombies accumulate. This can be set from as little as 5 zombies all the way\u00a0up to 250 for the intended experience.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD &amp; mouse - Move</li><li>Left click - Shoot</li><li>Right click - Aim</li><li>Scroll wheel - Change weapon</li><li>Shift - Sprint</li><li>C - Crouch</li><li>R - Reload</li><li>E - Interact</li><li>ESC - Pause</li></ul>\r\nPlanned Updates\r\n<ul><li>Boss zombies<br/>\n</li><li>More game modes</li><li>New highscore system</li><li>Short tutorial with time trial<br/>\n</li><li>Some kind of \"Story Mode\" that will\u00a0unlock weapons</li><li>A new location added with each major update</li></ul>\r\nChangelog\r\n<p>07/12/21\u00a0v1.0.0 - Latest</p>\n<ul><li>Inital public beta release</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f0346167d1197fdcbb7b366a0dba971d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZONOGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
