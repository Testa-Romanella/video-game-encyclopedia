Please be careful if you're prone to seizures. Shortly after the competition I will have an in-game toggle to turn this off. Unfortunately, that didn't make it in in time for the deadline.*<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>#### About:</p>\n<p>- Race throughout the underground grotto, pitted against two other mushroom characters.</p>\n<p>- Picking up glowing mushrooms gives you two effects: a positive and negative - which make getting to the finish line more of a challenge! Each effect is random, *good luck*!</p>\n<p>- Collecting multiple glowing mushrooms in short succession will add a multiplier to the effects of the power-ups and power-downs.</p>\n<p>- Do a shroom dance to 8 original songs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Procedurally generated platforms, decorations, and competitors for a different experience each run!</p>\n<p>- Platforms will fade over time, as competitors use them. Keep up with the bunch to avoid getting stuck behind!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>#### Controls:</p>\n<p>- Move: WASD or Arrows (Left or Right)</p>\n<p>- Jump: Spacebar</p>\n<p>- R: Reset the race</p>\n<p>---\u00a0</p>\n<p>#### Credits:</p>\n<p>- Main Team:</p>\n<p> - Programming: Chris Bradel</p>\n<p> - Art: Emily Farnsworth</p>\n<p> - Art and Music: Kyle Walter</p>\n<p> - Music: Ragnarok9x</p>\n<p> - Music: Willstr\u00f6m</p>\n<p>- Additional Assets and Special Thanks:</p>\n<p> - TinyLilFrog</p>\n<p> - AnneBrad and the Bradel Bunch</p>\n<p> ---</p>\n<p>#### Track List:</p>\n<p>- 4 on the Spore - Kyle</p>\n<p>- Sillyscybin - Kyle</p>\n<p>- Trip - Kyle</p>\n<p>- Bioluminescence - Raggy Claggy</p>\n<p>- Jeremy - Raggy Claggy</p>\n<p>- Submerged Cavern - Raggy Claggy</p>\n<p>- Cave - Wilstrom</p>\n<p>- Endless Shroomer - Wilstrom</p>\n<p>---</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ac/8ac2e644ae530d1b68500a7e56134fc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris Bradel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
