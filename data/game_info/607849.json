The game is unfinished, there being other ships to add and even a story mode, but\u00a0for now we have no plans on proceeding with\u00a0the development (However if it is requested, I may do so).<br/></p>\n<p>Design and Code: Aholo</p>\n<p>Art: Makuayas</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Adry Ismayle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T06:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9f/e9f7bd9f072749337c5ac3cd9d488678.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aholo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
