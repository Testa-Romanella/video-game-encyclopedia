I think it came out pretty well. I don't like all the music I make and this one is a bop, actually. If you don't like it you can mute the game and play your own music I guess. I mean, the rhythm component of this game really is non-existent. It doesn't matter what song you have playing for it. You CAN lose this game though. <strong>Spoilers:</strong> When you get to the final screen, if you're still hitting red notes, you'll get boo'd off the stage.\u00a0 Anyway, enjoy. See you next month with another one.) <br/></p>\n\n<p><em>This page designed intentionally to make your eyes bleed.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T08:48:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/835476b5c3b10cc58464c777fe4f56de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["E.X.Weis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
