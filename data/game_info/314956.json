You, as a poor poor psychic, have no other source of income, and are \"forced\" to take advantage of these people, at least, until you can get back on your feet.</p><p>In the beginning of the session, you can chat with your client. Here, they will provide you with helpful information you can use to \"communicate with their dead relative\" later on. The clients also have 3 stats, (1) Belief, (2) Impression, and (3) Generosity. The higher these are, the higher your client will pay out in the end.\u00a0</p><p>Happy Psychic-ing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T08:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92e/92e0fdc02984a0a1706eb8d94aa84451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tight Occasion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
