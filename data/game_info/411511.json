The concept of Signal Found was born in late August 2019 in Bob DeSchutter's IMS 488 capstone class of Game Pre-Production. A group of Bob's students then formed a well-equipped and experienced team and set out to create the vision encapsulated in the original concept document of Signal Found. This original concept was a game called Rover. Rover was a game very similar to Signal Found, however, it had a very significant difference: land navigation. Rover intended to use a vehicle similar to Opportunity, the Mars rover, as the entity the player controls. The decision to switch from a terrestrial rover into a quad-rotor drone came early in pre-production as a result of expanded design possibilities. With a drone, verticality could be readily used for puzzles and environment design, as well as the swift and agile movement of a quad-rotor. Rover still found its way into Signal Found through the naming of the quad-rotor: R03-VR, or Rover.<br/><br/></p><p>Jared Burkamper - C# Programmer</p>\n<p>Dustin Downs - 3D Artist, Graphic Designer</p>\n<p>Trey Grabinger - 3D Artist</p>\n<p>David Helbling - C# Programmer, Concept Artist, Composer</p>\n<p>Sean Keough - Project Manager, Site Manager, Social Media Manager</p>\n<p>Wilson Russell - Narrative Designer</p>\n<p>Christian Turner - 3D Artist</p>\n<p>Emily Waugh - Environment Artist, Level Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:26:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e77398f276eb12d670d53ee725ea91bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Signal Found"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
