All is good, everything is okay.</em></p>\n<p> <em>Chains of Memory</em> by <em>Studio Brainrot</em> is a Yume Nikki fangame, heavily inspired by a <em>JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure</em> based TTRPG campaign, run by our very own Robin Lima, also titled <em>Chains of Memory</em>. Take the role of Hanatsuki, and explore the world of her dreams, all molded and shaped by her absolute favorite TV show, <em>Chains of Memory</em>.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\tPlease note, this is currently just a demo and we will be adding more in the future! This is just a taste of what\u2019s to come. The campaign that the game is based on still is yet to be completed, so there\u2019s plenty more content for Hanatsuki to watch and dream about :)<br/>\n</p>\n<p>TW!!
