Severaler years later, I made it a very bad game. Four different endings, which is four times as many as the original! And that's terrible. It takes place sometime in Season 2, I guess? No spoilers.</p><p><strong>Warnings and disclaimers:</strong> Contains alcohol use, drug mentions, fighting in parking lots, fandom in-jokes, and pro gaming. I don't own Marble Hornets. If you've never watched Marble Hornets: a) you should because it's really good, and b) don't play this game because it will make no sense to you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33f/33f8a1e39d0c3c6cee831991f0e2b920.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["memewolves"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
