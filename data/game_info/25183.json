{"id": 25183, "slug": "galaga-90", "name": "GALAGA '90", "name_original": "GALAGA '90", "description": "<p>\n      This is an updated version of the classic arcade shooter Galaga. Set in \n      the vast reaches of space, you will fight your way through all 29 rounds \n      to reach the enemies' stronghold on Planet Galaga. Game levels consist \n      of a few rounds with changing enemies and backgrounds. To top it off, \n      the nostalgic \"Galactic Dancing\" lives on to mark the end of each level. \n      With the new addition of dimensions, you can choose your attack route. \n      Collect capsules and open dimension warps at branch sections to take on \n      even tougher enemies. GALAGA '90's inclusion of the triple fighter, \n      scrolling backgrounds, boss Galaga and even new system effects make it \n      nothing less than a masterpiece.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. See more Virtual Console games for Wii.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55b58f20d37ec61684cfde034e223a7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["NBGI"], "esrb_rating": null}
