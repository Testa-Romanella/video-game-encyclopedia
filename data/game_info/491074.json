It just stands there quietly, like a bonsai. So, I first created the blueprint editor, and then designed a customizable sea world, associated with both, and gradually enriched other game content.<br/><br/><strong>Blueprint editor</strong><br/><br/>The blueprint editor is a tool that allows you to stack your battleships or whatever is interesting with cubes. You can also get blueprints from other players to enrich your inventory. The more blueprints, the more game content abundant. Blueprints determine the specific performance of various ships in the game, which can be strong or weak, large or small.<br/><br/><strong>Naval battle and operate the cube warship</strong><br/><br/>The warships generated by the blueprint are all \"alive\". In the naval battle, you can operate a warship to move or attack, shoot at each other with hundreds of guns, smoke billows, and defeat the enemy warships to get rich rewards.<br/><br/><strong>Random map and transform the world</strong><br/><br/>At the beginning of the new game, ports, lands, resources and various ships will be randomly generated. As the game goes on, you can also constantly transform it, so that it really belongs to your own sea.<br/><br/><strong>Encounter war</strong><br/><br/>Encounter battle is a kind of battle on land for specific crew members. It is different from real-time naval battle. It is in the form of round battle chess. If you make some crew members into soldiers, you can take part in the battle. Please ignore their bullshit in the battle.<br/><br/><strong>Port management</strong><br/><br/>In the beginning, you only have a free port and a small ship. Through continuous growth, you will have ports all over the world, and you will drive even larger warships. The bigger the ship, the more crew and financial support you need, which means you More ports need to be controlled.<br/><br/><strong>Maritime trade</strong><br/><br/>Maritime trade is an important way to make money. Take an order, purchase goods everywhere and then transport them to the destination. You can get <br/>considerable profits.<br/><br/><strong>Catch parrots</strong><br/><br/>Don't forget to catch parrots. In the early stage of the game, they will play a good role in lubricating corresponding to different development routes.<br/><br/><strong>Communication</strong><br/>QQ group\uff1a766741697\uff08group 1\uff09", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T23:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/932/9324dfdcb1bb252a638b004b87be6aa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5fc3\u7530\u6e38\u620f(Heart Field Games)"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5fc3\u7530\u6e38\u620f(Heart Field Games)"], "esrb_rating": null}
