It is my first ever Unity C# programmed game title. It is a remake of the Public Domain Commodore 64 game, Rockit by the Power Shed.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This is a fun fast-paced party hi score attack game. The object of this game is to guide your rocket through the infinite voids of deep space. For each asteroid that passes by, you will score 50 points. Try not to crash your rocket into the asteroid or you will become toast. Keep on dodging the asteroids until your have a head on collision with an asteroid.<br/><br/>(C)2020 The New Dimension<br/><br/>Programming, game graphics, design and music by<br/><strong>RICHARD BAYLISS<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>The HTML5 version can be played online from</em><br/>https://simmer.io/@richard_tnd64/rockit<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T03:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d9318466edd3304962d7bc3b85b6875f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
