Still a Work in Progress. Let me know what you think should be the goal of the game. Should Pac-Man get a certain number of white pellets to win the stage and go to next stage, where the pellets go faster and faster. Or should Pac-Man be avoiding those white pellets and only be trying to eat maybe Cherries that fall, that are healthy for him? Open to ideas. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c4f46c58dcc887c36c2c612d40fa6be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JohnyFive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
