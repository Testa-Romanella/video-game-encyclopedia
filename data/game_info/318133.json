Your goal is to survive as long as you can while also taking down as many enemy ships possible before you become overrun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created by: Leah Blasczyk (@Lebrra), Sydney Myers (@Sydney Myers), and Wesley McWhorter (@WesMcW)</p>\n<p>Music: \"Airship Serenity\" by Kevin Macleod</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T09:04:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f93/f9302fa3f2156de1f57730ef6982e764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lebrra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
