That's not quite right \u2013 because AIRA VR is not like other tower defense games in virtual reality. Once the battle starts you find yourself in the midst of the fight!<br/><br/>AIRA VR merges the strategic elements of the tower defense genre and the thrilling action of a first person shooter in an intelligent manner and combines the best of both worlds.\u00a0</p>\n<br/>Complete Experience\r\n<p>This is a small demo version with steamVR support. You can find the full version on Steam and\u00a0Oculus store.</p>\n<br/>Languages\r\n<ul><li>english</li><li>german</li><li>french</li><li>spanish</li><li>russian</li></ul>\n\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The game consists of two phases. The\u00a0<strong>strategic phase</strong>\u00a0starts in the command ship, where the player maps out a defensive strategy by building towers on the holographic tactic table. In the\u00a0<strong>action phase</strong>\u00a0the player will be teleported into the level itself to actively prevent the enemy spaceships from destroying our facility alongside his towers. By progressing through the game, you can unlock different towers and powerful weapons, each needing to be handled differently, to fight against increasingly stronger and diverse types of enemies.\r\n</p>\n\r\nRequirements\r\n<p>A SteamVR compatible HMD is required to play (Oculs Rift, HTC Vive, Valve Index, WMR...)</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Hardware:</strong></p>\n<p>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.<br/>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 equivalent or better<br/>Intel Core i5-4590 equivalent or better<br/>4 GB RAM<br/>DirectX 11</p>\n\n<p>...psst, follow us on:</p>\n<p>instagram<br/>facebook<br/>twitter<br/>aira-vr.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T09:32:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/708dc2d6589c2e7541d078034c3fe2e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ACatsDream", "RB-DomK"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
