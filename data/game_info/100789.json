At the moment, I only have a Vive on hand to test with. While you, the valued consumer, are not QA, if there's some Oculus issue that crops up, let me<br/></p><p>If you're having performance issues, consider changing the shadow modes in the Settings menu. Blob shadows will be faster, but real-time shadows look best.<br/></p><p>Sploot's OSX VR support is uncertain. v1.01 should work with a DK2 on OSX. v1.02 probably won't at all with Oculus headsets. v1.02 is untested with a Vive on OSX. Assume that VR support is only guaranteed for Windows.</p>Latest Release Notes<p>12/17/2016 </p><p>Version 1.0.3 </p><p>It's been a long time coming, but the Vive support is finally here! Oculus is still supported, too, so you should have no problem with either headset.</p><p>Many performance updates are also included in this build. Performance increased enough that I've removed baked-lighting from the graphics option. At this point, real-time shadows perform well enough on most systems that I don't think baked lighting is worth the extra load times.</p>Development Roadmap<p>Next on the table for Sploot is additional performance improvements.<br/></p>Press Accolades<p>\"Luxuriate in the simple joys of a poop joke using the latest in VR technology\" - Killscreen.</p><p>\"With its simple, crude and silly gameplay, <em>Sploot</em> is a hoot\" - Free Game Planet.</p><p>\"Is this your latest trend, 2015.
