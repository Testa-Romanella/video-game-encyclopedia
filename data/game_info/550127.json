The shards of color found it's way into some lucky hands and color factions were formed. And for some reason, it's your job to help fix it. You play as a cat dude and fight your way through extremely difficult bullet hell style boss battles in an attempt to get back home and out of this strange world. In the process, you'll make many friends and enemies.<br/><br/>The game switches between a lively top-down overworld to a straight on bullet-hell boss rush type game. You'll fight many different bosses while attempting to bring together the color shards. There is different modes for varying levels of difficulty, so if you just want some casual play there are options, as well as a very difficult mode for those seeking a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>This is a demo showing a small portion of the gameplay of Color War, there is going to be far more content in the full game. There are weekly devlogs going on on the Plasma Studios youtube channel. As well as the Color War Twitter.</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong></p>\n<p>The full game will be much more difficult than this demo, as this is the intro section of the game. So if you feel like it's too easy, there will be more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T04:30:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f39d47a65b2a655372283c04a4339003.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Plasma Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
