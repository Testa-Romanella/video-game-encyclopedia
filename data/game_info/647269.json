One day, a tower that has remained a landmark since Cecil Town was built starts shooting lightning, destroying crops and houses.<br/>Residing in Cecil Town's borders is a force which will soon change the world....<br/><br/>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Heya, this was made for the 16 Day RPG Maker Themed Game Jam #1. It took\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~44 Hours to make. Notice the ~, since I have about no concept of time and only updated that counter when I remembered to, but that's about how accurate I assume it is. Either way, I'm glad this could be finished... even if in demo form. Also sorry if the battle art for the characters looks too much like Final Fantasy 1 - 3 I swear I did not outright copy anything but I used WAYYYY too much inspiration\u00a0from those because apparently I suck at making battle art for characters, and also sorry for not having any custom music. I suuuuuck at music, and I don't have time to make a bunch of tunes let alone tunes in general because I can't make good music.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T07:00:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/935/9352a80eb58d131dd269a43076f1aec8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charbomber"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
