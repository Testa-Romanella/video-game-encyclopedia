But on a routine delivery to the remote floating continent of Ilvard, he finds himself ambushed by two dragon-riding ne\u2019er-do-wells who send his plane spiraling to the ground.<br />\nFortunately for Ragna, his crash was witnessed by someone in a position to do something about it: vampire princess Alwen du Moonbria. Pulling the dying Ragna from the wreckage of his plane, Alwen forms a blood contract with him, saving his life in exchange for his services as her vassal.<br />\nHer request is far from simple \u2013 Alwen needs Ragna\u2019s help both to recover her stolen magic, and to retake her castle, wrested from her mere weeks ago by villains unknown. Ragna\u2019s ready to ante up, but on one condition: instead of acting as Alwen\u2019s servant, he wants to undertake their adventure as equal partners...even though it could very well make the going tougher!<br />\nSo begins the unlikely duo\u2019s trek across Ilvard. Along the way they\u2019ll meet the isle\u2019s strange and colorful residents, battle the minions of darkness, train pets, learn potent skills from a macho masked luchador, and discover the meaning of (slightly dysfunctional) friendship. Sure, the bad guys might have the upper hand, but luckily for Ragna and Alwen, they never saw a tag-team this weird coming!FEATURESTwo Playable Characters for Tag-Team Action<br />\nNo need to go it alone when you\u2019ve got the power of two on your side. Ragna roughs up foes in melee range, while Alwen fires off salvos of powerful magic or locks down enemies from afar. Switch between the two on the fly to create crazy combos!<br />\nUnique Food-Based Experience System Gives Greater Control Over Leveling<br />\nExperience is gained through eating food, so you can choose to cash in immediately, or save it to trade later for food worth even more EXP. You can even beat the game at level 1...if you dare.<br />\nStrange and Quirky Setting with Strange and Quirky Characters<br />\nThe residents of Ilvard are a lively lot, and you can learn more about each one in your spare time as the story progresses. What\u2019s the deal with that chain-smoking nun? Which of the three maids shirks the most work? And... is that a girl in a giant penguin costume?<br />\nBrand New, Expanded English Voices<br />\nWe\u2019ve greatly expanded on the Japanese release\u2019s voice acting, with over 2000 never-before-voiced lines bringing the twists and turns of the main story to life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T02:46:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc90404f8713e306a99ba9e6e92b1b60.jpg", "website": "http://visitilvard.com/", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 763, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 512, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nihon Falcom"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["XSEED Games", "Marvelous USA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
