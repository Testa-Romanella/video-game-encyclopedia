While walking home from work late at night, one single choice in one instant will change everything--much like an old story she read at school. One choice saves the day--one door leads to a lady. One choice destroys her--the door to the tiger. But, also like the old story, she has no real way of telling which choice is which.</p>\n<p>Which door will you open?</p>\n\n<p><em>Inspired by the short story of the same title by Frank R. Stockton. Music by Kevin Macleod and Scott Buckley.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c2104f600d1ddbfaaad4d27455ef8c78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["eddeha"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
