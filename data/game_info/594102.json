DON'Y USE BY SAFARI.</strong></li></ul>\n<p>IS71073B: Interactive Narrative and Digital Storytelling (2020-21)</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0# ABOUT \" I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD\":</strong></p>\n<p>This is an interactive narrative and digital storytelling.\u00a0I always self-doubt: Is this a game?\u00a0\"I want to have a child\" is different from normal games. It doesn't have characters moving, it's breaking through. It's just telling stories.</p>\n<p>I use a lot of character illustrations and background illustrations as the scenes, hoping to create a relaxed and happy atmosphere. If you just click on this game, you can feel that this is a relaxing game. Instead, I want to express a sad story. In real life, organ gene trafficking is a dark market, and the surrogacy market is illegal in China. Racial discrimination is sad. It\u2019s painful not to recognize yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0# STORY OVERVIEW:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\"I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD\" is based on a virtual store-\"selling children's genes and surrogacy\" as the background. The protagonist Joanna is an inferior person. She believes that her unhappy life is related to her gender, race, character, and intelligence. So, she came to the \"CHILD MARKET\" to buy a perfect child in her heart.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Why do we live? What do I want to do with my life? What are my strengths? you can easily find yourself questioning these.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>You should think: Which Joanna are you?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Medium:\u00a0https://shiqike0115.medium.com/i-want-to-have-a-child-postmortem-ae032abc2305\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0#\u00a0DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Unity 3D, Fungus, photoshop, Axure RP, Twine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:58:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2b39d7178662d962624be514165cea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Qike Shi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
