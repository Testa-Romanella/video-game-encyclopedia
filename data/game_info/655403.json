Whether by taking your vehicle through the air or onto the rainy city streets, or by jumping out and hitting the dark alleys on foot. Earn money by capturing or killing bounties and spend it on upgrading your gear, or go and make a deal with a mega corporation. This action-RPG lets you, an ex-fed, climb from the bottom of crime ridden city, through the criminal ladder and to the top.<br />\nKEY FEATURES<br />\nOpen world for you to explore by any means.<br />\nWhether in first person or third person, enjoy your unrestricted flight through this sprawling futuristic city. Take your vehicle to the air and soar through the mega city and towering skyscrapers. Or head down to the neon soaked streets for a drive while you jam out to the radio.</p>\n<p>And we mean, by any means<br />\nBut sometimes leaving your vehicle behind and setting out on your feet will be the best option when chasing down bounties through the alleyways and balconies of Prey City. Take advantage of the density of the city and cut off your bounty by leaping from one ledge to another.</p>\n<p>Either collect your bounties without using lethal force<br />\nTense hand to hand combat. Counter your enemies and take advantage of their weaknesses, expose them and then take them down to the ground. Opting to clear the bounty without using lethal force has its benefits.</p>\n<p>Or take them down on your own terms<br />\nHack into the cameras and take control of the security droids and utilize their guns to kill, then in the proceeding commotion, whip out one our own guns to finish the bounty off, or choke slam them into the concrete and out of existence. Either way it&#39;s your choice how you decide to capture or kill your target.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#39;t end there<br />\nScan your surroundings to get vital information on a bounty, interrogate bounties as they surrender to potentially get a better reward, take advantage of endless bounty generation to continue honing your skills, spend money to upgrade your gear for cybernetic upgrades and weapons, and more! Vigilance 2099 is the cyberpunk game you&#39;ve always deserved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2022-12-11T23:27:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/881/881e3304f6fc7bc4de5b869720de8321.jpg", "website": "https://www.vigilance2099.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 12}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Envoidant Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Behemoth Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
