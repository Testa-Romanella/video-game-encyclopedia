I tried to take a more figurative approach, and trying to figure out how the main character could 'grow' as a person. Was growing as a person even possible for you, or was every action you take futile from the start?</p><p>This was the first time I've made anything close to a finished game. And since I had experience with JS and HTML I decided to try an entirely text based game. It was incredibly fun to figure out how to connect certain points, as well as figure out how the story should go.</p><p>Even though it is submitted to a game jam, I don't expect anyone to vote for this game, as it is inherently an incredibly small game. All I ask is that you enjoy the experience!</p>\n<p>If you find any mistakes, be sure to let me know so I can fix it as soon as possible.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T06:58:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bc/4bcdf3016cdbe508c60a0c833e1f76a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pomz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
