Pick up some cat food off the ground and drop it near the cat to entice it closer. Though the cat is timid and will attempt to stay as far away from you as possible, it is (fortunately) a very verbal cat and will let you know when it thinks you\u2019re too close. You must temper your eagerness with patience and understanding to earn the cat\u2019s trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD or arrow keys for movement</li><li>Hold Shift to walk slowly</li><li>Space bar for interactions</li></ul>\n<p>I made this game for a class at UC Davis. I plan to continue working on this, as this has only about 10% of the features that I wanted to add. Hope you like it!</p>\n\n<p>Twitter: @xmunchy<br/>email: xmunchy@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e72/e72f5b62a6df93b7bd010df6ba6a5e8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["xmunchy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
