This game experiments a bit more with the screen-filling aesthetics as you traverse more gigantic, spike infested worlds.</p><p>Originally made in 2014 for a school assignment but never released, finally put up on the web with some much needed tweaks. There is no real goal in the game, so explore and find something that challenges you. You can tone down the game speed from the options menu if things are getting too challenging, or quick save to take a break from the game.</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/186/18627c182bd384c7c480ec0d0ffde4d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Auroriax"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
