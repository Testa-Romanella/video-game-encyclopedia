{"id": 960337, "slug": "soul-cliff", "name": "Soul Cliff", "name_original": "Soul Cliff", "description": "Soul Cliff is a souls-like game about an individual who is attempting to save another trapped beneath a collapsed sink-hole. The gameplay is very close to a souls-like experience with the added element of an ultimate ranged ability but without a riposte mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThe gameplay involves rolling, parrying, shielding, heavy/light attacking, activating your ultimate, and drinking potions to beat your opponents. There are currently four main boss fights. Due to the Early Access state, the final boss needs more design work. The other bosses are essentially complete.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThe story begins after the Self survives a sink-hole incident where his significant other was consumed by the earth. Desperately he tries to soften the caved-in rocks but to no avail. Not all options are considered due to the seriousness and time-sensitive nature of the event, and he converse with his thoughts The Self in an attempt to free her.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tSoul Cliff is named coincidentally with the souls-like gameplay. The soul is the Self, the person separate from the body. Food nourishes the body, but what nourishes the soul? There is a cliff in the game positioned above the sink-hole. Thus Soul Cliff.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T03:55:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2b/e2bdefe7ea6a4141c490fd3eca94ffa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garett A C Hunter"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Garett A C Hunter"], "esrb_rating": null}
