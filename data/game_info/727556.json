Desperate to create again for an upcoming show, players enter the mind of the artist to rebuild his fractured imagination. Blocks aims to deliver an immersive experience that maximizes the potential of home VR. This is the first Up Above Studio production, experimenting with new approaches in narrative, audio, spatial and interaction design in Virtual Reality. Blocks is about finding light in the darkest of moments. We sought to tell a story that teaches us no emotion is permanent, and no feeling is final.</p>\n\r\nCreditsIngram MaoCreator/ Designer/ Developer/ Level Designer/ Technical ArtistAdam MorinaCreator/ Designer/ Developer/ Narrative Designer/ Audio DesignerMarkel BodalloMusic Composer/ Audio EngineerAbby SherlockVoice ActorGarrett BaerVoice ActorCarrie Chen3D Artist", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T04:46:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54d/54da5b4810574827e8f11832836dfb2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UpAboveStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
