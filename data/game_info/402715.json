No one asked for an edutainment game aimed at high school and college students but here it is. Here's a dumb little game that approaches the topic of what happens to students who tie their mental health to their grades.</p>\n<p>Play as the main character's pet moth on 45 platforming levels as you help your owner complete their homework. Don't forget to check the sticky notes left by your owner to see how their holding up in their new college environment! Will you be able to complete the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and(gasp) division math problem to help your owner through the semester.</p>\r\nNotes\r\n<ul><li>Approximate 30-60 minutes of play time</li><li>Hand painted watercolor graphics</li><li>Made by a solo game dev</li></ul>\r\nArtist Statement\r\n<p>Making this game I was inspired by all of the edutainment video game titles I played as a kid. The kind of simple little games that tried teach math and critical thinking. I started thinking about what an edutainment title for an older audience would be like. The way I see it the content of what\u2019s being taught isn\u2019t the most important difference.  The most important difference is that older students are way more stressed. Overall I\u2019m just trying to capture the feeling of being an older student. I want players to feel a little bit of the stress that comes with telling students that their grades will define their futures. I hope you enjoy finding out that the test is nothing like the homework.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0-Your humble game dev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:26:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf68f686ec3b96ddcb43681e7f5aa62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JadenMcElvey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
