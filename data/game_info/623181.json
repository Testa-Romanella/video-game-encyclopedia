Each player can choose from three classes, each with their own unique ability to traverse two unique levels with traps and powerups scattered across.</p>\n<p>This is a student project, where the aim was to create a battle game with no bloodshed, no violence, no death. So this game doesn't have a health bar, and all the players have is their class abilities and their \"nudge\" power, to knock the flag away from each other, score points, and bank them at deposit zones.</p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<p>The players have one goal: capture the flag. The players need to capture the flag, and hold onto it to accumulate points. Be careful though, because if you get too greedy, another player can come and take the flag from you, resetting your score and you get nothing. To bank the points, take the flag to the deposit zone, where you can drop the flag and score your points. Player with the highest points wins.</p>\r\nControls: An XBox\u00a0Controller Is Recommended\r\n<p>Movement: WASD/Left Joystick</p>\n<p>Camera Movement: Mouse/Right Joystick</p><p>Jump: Space/A</p><p>Run: Shift/Left Joystick Button</p><p>Pause: Esc/Start</p><p>Submit: Enter/A</p><p>Ability 1: Key 1/Left Mouse Button/ LB</p><p>Ability 2: Key 2/Right Mouse Button/RB</p><p>Ability 3: Key 3/X</p><p>Ability 4: Key 4/Y<br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Jesse Anderton</p>\n<p>Alex Micic<br/></p>\n<p>Hannah Mount</p>\n<p>Lucas Taennler</p>\n<p>For Asset Sources/Copyrights <strong>Click Here!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T06:39:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e3/6e338dad88a7c0fe03d5f070b143ef17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skully_Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
