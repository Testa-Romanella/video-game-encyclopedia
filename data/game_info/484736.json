With no indication of where to go or what to do, you have no choice but to explore, solve puzzles, and try to find a way home.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStaying true to the Myst-vania genre, nothing in the game is outright explained to you; a big part of the game is about exploring, learning, and piecing together clues about what's going on and how everything works.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T17:58:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b8c602d16dbfb53669d4bc4846b0ad3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tad Cordle"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tad Cordle"], "esrb_rating": null}
