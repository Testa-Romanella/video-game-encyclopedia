He decides he also must leave, so he can start a successful business and then move it to the island to make it appreciated again.\r\n  </p>\n<p>For doing that, he needs to get the keys to success: Patience, Confidence and Motivation. For getting these, he speaks with the people living on the island, who make him solve riddles, crack a code or find his way through a maze and then give him the key.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0Why the name? Well, I hope the puzzles will help make you more intelligent. I know, I'm not very creative with names, or art for that matter, as none of the art, graphics or sounds!, is mine. I just made the engine and the gameplay.\u00a0 If it seems as though the story latched on and not meant to be there, it is. I just needed a story around the puzzle game, but it's not good or important.</p>\n<p>Sorry for any bugs, but I hope that with help of this, my first game, I can find out what people consider to be more, or less important in games.</p>\n<p>Why I made it in Java: When I started out programming, I did alot of Java game-dev tutorials. So I have alot of experience with this.</p><p>CREDITS:</p><p>Most textures were made by Lanea Zimmerman (Sharm)</p>\n<p>The bald man was made by Cough-E (find him on opengameart.org)</p>\n<p>The music was made by:</p>\n<p>Soliloquy: Mathew Pablo (opengameart.org)</p>\n<p>Medieval: Miguel Herrero (opengameart.org)</p>\n<p>Mysterious Ambience (song 21): cynicmusic (see: pixelsphere.org) but got it on opengameart.org too.</p>\n<p>That's all.
