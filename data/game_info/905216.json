While I'm not fully satisfied with how the final result turned out -- there were multiple things I hadn't looked into or known until too deep into the project -- I'm glad I learned what I did.</p>\n\n<p>I'm going to spend some time figuring out funcref's, enemy states and a few other things \u00a0before my next project. My work has been very basic and I'd like to increase the scale a little bit. My plan is to make a Link's Awakening or Enter The Gungeon style dungeon crawler. Ideally I can get it out by March or April. We'll see what happens.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T10:30:31", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daborlo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
