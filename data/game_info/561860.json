But most importantly, use the Power (red) and Defense (blue) Orbs to your benefit.<br/>Clicking either Orb will result in your Attack or Defense increasing dramatically for 15 seconds. After this boost, you must kill 4 enemies to recharge it.</p>\n<p><strong>The orbs are Stronger Together</strong><strong>.\u00a0</strong>If you activate both simultaneously, you will gain Godlike Power, but with the cost of a much greater recharge cost...<br/></p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>\n<p>Once the Jam ends I'll upload a web version to make the game easier to play (I didn't have enough time to build a web version since I\u00a0submitted this at 2 am, I\u00a0was way too tired).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71b/71bc6e0ae96fc2b53982b18bb0339889.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Icosmophedron"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
