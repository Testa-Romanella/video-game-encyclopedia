In my dream, I am very afraid of them and I want to stay away from them as much as possible. But every time there are some circumstances that force me to go to these zombies. And it's very scary, but I eventually go. I need to work out my zombies somehow. After all, I'm actually afraid of more abstract things. So let the zombies be afraid of them too. And the player can specifically look for my zombies and find out from the replicas above them what the zombies are worried about. What I'm worried about. And, maybe, what the player himself sometimes worries about.</p>\n<p>The game is designed to be played on a PC. It is better to play with headphones.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T08:27:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/179/179a1101d6c0da0908e779e3ac49b48b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anastasia Krohaleva"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
