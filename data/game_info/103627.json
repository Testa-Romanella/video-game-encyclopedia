{"id": 103627, "slug": "mhrd-itch", "name": "MHRD (itch)", "name_original": "MHRD (itch)", "description": "<p>MHRD is a hardware design game, in which you design various hardware circuits in a hardware description language. The hardware circuits you design get more complex as you go until you create a fully functional CPU design. <br/><br/>MHRD is set in the 1980's where you join the hardware startup Microhard with the goal of disrupting the computer hardware industry by creating a more efficient CPU design. You are provided with specifications of more than 20 hardware circuits, for which you have to create working designs. Your designs are simulated and verification tests are run to let you know that your design actually works. While this is a puzzle game at its core, all designs you create could actually be implemented in hardware (or be run in an FPGA). </p><p>Also available on Steam: MHRD on Steam</p><p>If you have any problems, questions or feedback please write us a mail!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3af/3af2402d46ce3cbcaef00d2e43c01cf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["icy"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
