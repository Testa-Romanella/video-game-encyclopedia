Except you're drunk. Or maybe the mech is drunk, we can't tell. And runs on a short battery.</p>\n<p>We've shaved any complexities of piloting down to simple click-and-drag controls, since you're drunk. Or the mech. Either way, click and drag, and lay waste to the city of the evil Zendardians, whose tanks have a proclivity to duck and roll. Truly evil.</p>\n<p>Controls are just mouse, and R to restart.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this brief yet action-packed romp!</p>\n<p>Assault//Battery was made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 39, the theme was <strong>Running Out of Power</strong>.
