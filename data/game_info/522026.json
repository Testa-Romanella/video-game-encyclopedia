Forget about the problems and enjoy with the incredible music and wonderful art.<br/></p>\n<p>Anemones protect clownfishs. Clownfishs give food to anemones. Doesn't that sound like a win-win situtation?</p>\n<p>In <strong>Clownbiosis</strong>, you are a little clownfish who lives in an anemone. You have to recolect food in order to feed you and your anemone. But be careful! If you don't feed it, the anemone will die.</p>\n<p>If you live enough time, you'll put an egg. When you die, your child will take your place. The children have some disadvantages, but it is not a problem, because we have to accept everyone!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>We are <strong>Alien Garden</strong>!
