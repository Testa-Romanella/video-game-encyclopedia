Although no one taught them this.</p>\n<p>The plot of &quot;Become Human&quot; is built around three characters, each with a separate storyline, but they eventually merge into a single picture.</p>\n<p>Connor is a police investigator and android. He has a simple task - to find androids, deviated from the path given by humans. He has a special vision, it allows him to see events as they happened. And the more information he collects, the higher his chances of acting correctly.</p>\n<p>Kara is an android-housekeeper which spontaneously develops self-consciousness. As a result, Kara assumes responsibility for the fate of the little girl whom she worked as a sitter for. She, along with the girl, escapes from the house as a result of a conflict with her father, the owner of Kara.</p>\n<p>Markus is a caretaker android. He also acquired self-consciousness and came to the idea that androids need freedom. He has the ability to grant androids free will and to calculate the consequences of some actions.</p>\n<p>The story develops depending on the decisions taken by the characters. Some decisions have to be made quickly. Sometimes a player can return to the moment of making a choice and replay the situation.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-23T10:18:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/951/951572a3dd1e42544bd39a5d5b42d234.jpg", "website": "https://www.quanticdream.com/en/detroit-become-human", "rating": 4.32, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 566, "owned": 4890, "beaten": 2996, "toplay": 869, "dropped": 194, "playing": 181}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 3073, "suggestions_count": 493, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3133, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Quantic Dream"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "Quantic Dream"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
