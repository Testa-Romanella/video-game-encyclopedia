For this I decided to make a\u00a0 more suspenseful Pacman, where the player cannot see the map other than locally around themselves and around the power pellets. The color of the light around the player becomes more red and the ghost movement audio the player hears becomes louder\u00a0the closer a ghost is to the player. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/578/5780b599c89e0ee678da62f636d61ad1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaleTGrant"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
