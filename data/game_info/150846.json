The theme for this GGJ was \"wave,\" so we eventually decided on a tsunami/flood-based game.\u00a0They must rescue the civilians inside the tower, then escape in their helicopter to complete the game. I made the riddle-solving system\u00a0(though not the riddles themselves), and I am quite proud of it, despite it being scaled incorrectly and kind of simplistic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd9/bd9ee02699ec085f8b66a982f5a439dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CabooseNomerson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
