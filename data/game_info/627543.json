{"id": 627543, "slug": "wavetiles", "name": "WaveTiles", "name_original": "WaveTiles", "description": "WaveTiles is a co-op puzzle platformer game for <strong>2 players</strong> based on a simple concept which is gradually enriched with a variety of gameplay mechanics. Your goal is to move across each level before your time runs out and the level starts collapsing. <br/><br/>Levels are built on a grid-based design and consist of Tiles that have to be activated by energy <strong>Waves</strong>. One player controls<strong> Explorer</strong> who navigates on the level and the other controls <strong>Spirit</strong> which spawns Waves of 4 different colours and so creates colorful paths for Explorer to follow!<br/><br/>Tiles can have different <strong>attributes</strong> or host <strong>traps</strong> and so players will have to take them into account, but they will also be able to utilize a number of magical <strong>abilities</strong> to help them counter danger.<br/><br/>The two characters have distinct roles and separate responsibilities but their actions are interconnected as the progression through the game\u2019s levels requires <ul><li>continuous communication,</li><li>common strategy and</li><li>effortless synergy</li></ul><br/>Both players share the same camera view and advance together as one allows the other to get a step closer to the finish line. You will laugh and scream after making mistakes, congratulate or condemn your partner\u2019s decisions and after crossing the finish line you will both receive and share the same feeling of accomplishment.<br/><br/>You are not just depending on each other to win, you are <strong>amplifying</strong> each other\u2019s experience!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T02:33:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ac/7ac19d1085b6efd002883a65ff32e1a2.jpg", "website": "https://www.whocaresgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["WhoCares Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WhoCares Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
