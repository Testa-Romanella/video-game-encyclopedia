Bored to death looking at the fleeing landscape, I thought : Hey, what if I was stuck in a time loop ? And got murdered a bunch of times, <em>of course</em>.\u00a0\u00a0So I frankensteined this together, creating a melting-pot of several inspirations.\u00a0Here is a non exhaustive list :\u00a0</p><ul><li>You know how in\u00a0Madoka Magika, you've got cute magical girls and then BAM! <strong>(Spoilers ahead)\u00a0</strong>Murder time loop. Well that's the idea. Plus, It subverses expectations beautifully.</li><li>Do you know the Yandere sterotype in anime ? Yeah, just like\u00a0Yuno Gasai in\u00a0Mirai Nikki. Well that's that.</li><li>This video is freaking cool.</li><li>Obviously, this\u00a0disaster of a game\u00a0...</li><li>Bonus : Do you know what Mayan stands for ? Take a guess ... No ? Well, it's short for <em>\"Ma Yandere\"</em> or <em>\"<strong>My </strong>Yandere\"</em> in english.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Download below !</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T06:50:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61c245eed41d3c0512e9b6ef6ba8038b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bigeishe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
