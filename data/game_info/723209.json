You play as a suited-up germaphobe blasting germs.</p>\n<p>The goal of the Trijam is to make a game in 3 hours so I wanted to see what I could do with Gdevelop in that amount of time. It turns out that I can make a fairly simple wave shooter in that timeframe at a leisurely pace. This is due to the fact that I used third-party assets for art and sounds so that I could focus on the game making. And Gdevelop is good for turning out basic games quickly.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>For art, I used a few of Kenney's assets:</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets</p>\n<p>Music and sound effects came from here:</p>\n<p>https://mixkit.co/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T05:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6d58934863d0e3c9bdf459863519529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
