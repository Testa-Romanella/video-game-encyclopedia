Unsure in where to go and what had happened, you find clues in hopes you can find your family again. Only soon to realize you may not be the only one there after all...</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p>Note: This game was developed on my laptop since I've been recovering from my ACL surgery and been bedridden. I gave the\u00a07-day\u00a0challenge for myself as a beginner indie developer to\u00a0really give myself practice so for my next game so it can go a lot smoother. I also, didn't want to fall victim to never finishing a game so here's my first!\u00a0 I hope you all enjoy it! Be ready for the next when I'm finally able to sit at my desktop!</p>\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter and Instagram @NoShellGS for updates!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T09:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36c/36c5cd70c567fcadd9d35cc1e6692c07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NoShell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
