The\u00a0alien must jump and climb through each level using platformer mechanics to collect all the stars, then bring them back to her spaceship. Along the way she must avoid or defeat\u00a0enemies and hazards, collect coins, and solve puzzles such as locked doors.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>The hero of \u201cAlien Archeologist\u201d, Loo-Ra, sets out to become a famous archeologist. The nearby solar system Vorganth is just waiting to be explored. Tales have been circulating that Vorganth is home to artifacts of the ancient Xylatu civilization, called The Calypso Stars. These stars are rumoured to have a mysterious power when all 100 stars are brought together. Loo-Ra sees this as the perfect opportunity to earn her chops as an archeologist, and seeks to uncover the mystery of the Callypso stars by exploring each planet in the Vorganth system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, she\u2019s not the only one out to gather them. Each level will correspond to a planet in the Vorganth system. The planets are varied, and Loo-Ra will have to make her way through increasingly difficult challenges in order to find all<br/></p>\n<p>of the Stars. Once she has, she will be given a vision of the past Xalytu civilisation - the greatest prize an archeologist could wish for. Her name as an archeologist will be made, and she can move on to her next big adventure!</p>\n\n\n<p>Doors will not unlock until the star for the level is picked up!</p>\n<p>WASD to move. SPACE to jump.</p>\n<p>note: the design is currently in need of some polish.<br/></p>\n\n<p>the player can jump off of the sides of walls, the game is currently balanced around this. Please do not abuse the ability to stick to the undersides of terrain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:49:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/287/287105b509f1329fab7025ba45dbba6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NekroticGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
