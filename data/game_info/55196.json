{"id": 55196, "slug": "wwf-raw", "name": "WWF Raw", "name_original": "WWF Raw", "description": "<p>WWF RAW is a video game based on the television show of the same name produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), released for the SNES, 32X, Mega Drive/Genesis, and Game Boy in late 1994 and early 1995 by Acclaim Entertainment. It is the sequel to the WWF Royal Rumble game that was released in 1993, and is the final part of LJN's 16-bit WWF trilogy. Players can play either One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, or a Raw Endurance Match. Unlike its predecessor, WWF RAW is multitap compatible.</p>\n<p>WWF RAW introduces differences between the characters in that they not only have their own signature moves, but differing move sets altogether (including new over-the-top \"mega moves\"). The game adds many moves not seen in the previous games, such as a DDT, a fallaway slam, and various types of suplexes. Additionally, wrestlers differ in attributes of speed, strength, stamina, and weight.</p>\n<p>The game itself is arcade-like and involves a \"tug-of-war\" system in which, when the wrestlers lock-up, a meter appears above them and players must repeatedly press buttons to pull the energy away from the opponent's side to theirs. With more energy, they can perform moves with greater impact. Once an opponent's energy is low enough, a player can perform a wrestler's unique signature move.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee5efc2f2aa2e53a1915ad8094812b46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["SEGA 32X", "SNES", "Game Boy", "Game Gear", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Sculptured Software", "Realtime Associates", "Acclaim Black Team"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Acclaim Entertainment", "LJN"], "esrb_rating": null}
