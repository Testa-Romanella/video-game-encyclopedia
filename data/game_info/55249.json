Released for the Amiga 1200 and Amiga CD32, the game was heavily inspired by the Legend of Zelda series, with other influences including Secret of Mana and The Secret of Monkey Island. The plot involves an inheritance dispute between two princes\u2014Gallus and Kale\u2014in which the former murders his brother to secure his position as king. However, Kale had secretly made a pact with his friend, Cho, that would place him as king should Kale be murdered. Players assume the role of Cho, and adventure throughout the land of Speris.</p>\n<p>The Speris Legacy met with mediocre critical reception. Amiga Format's Steve McGill, while praising the game's graphics, described its gameplay as \"relentless tedium\", and gave it a score of 69%. Martin Davies of CU Amiga complained that the game's lack of hints regarding the player's goals results in \"endless meandering\" and frustration, and scored it 74%.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd3b5a540ac5a1892d9e8ae016e84dce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Binary Emotions"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
