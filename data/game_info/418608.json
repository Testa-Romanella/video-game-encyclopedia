The home of the Blockels.</p>\n<p>This game is about co-operating with your Blockle brethren across 4 different tribes. They all have different abilities and you need to run jump and stack your way to the goal of every level.</p>\n<p>Hey all!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>So this is my <strong>first</strong> <strong>game</strong>, I hope you like it.\u00a0 I've set this first version up with 11 levels and have put 2 of the 4 playable characters in those first levels. I have already created the 2 other playable characters of a Ninja (faster movement and double jump)\u00a0and a Flying blockle\u00a0 (can fly anywhere on the level but cant land).\u00a0I'm planning on making 100 levels for this in total so I\u00a0have a fair way to go but wanted to get something out in the world. I'd love to hear what you all think of it and am really interested to hear any feedback.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have used the awesome tileset and backgrounds from</p>\n<p>https://kasianov-maksim.itch.io/pixel-adventure<br/></p>\n<p>and the four seasons tileset from</p>\n<p>https://rottingpixels.itch.io/four-seasons-platformer-tileset-16x16free</p>\n<p>The rest is custom artwork and i've made all the music, FX and voices\u00a0myself.</p>\n<p>The game supports keyboard and controller.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls for Keyboard:</strong></p>\n<p>Up (menu) - <strong>W</strong></p>\n<p>Down (menu) - <strong>S</strong></p>\n<p>Left - <strong>A</strong></p>\n<p>Right - <strong>D</strong></p>\n<p>Switch Player Left - <strong>E</strong></p>\n<p>Switch Player Right - <strong>R</strong></p>\n<p>Jump - <strong>Space</strong></p>\n<p>Next Dialog - <strong>N</strong></p>\n<p>Select - <strong>Enter</strong></p>\n<p>ESC - <strong>Pause</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And Controller:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement and menu - <strong>D-Pad</strong></p>\n<p>Camera Movement - Right Analog</p>\n<p>Jump / Select / Dialog Next\u00a0-<strong> A/X</strong></p>\n<p>Switch Player Left -<strong> LT</strong></p>\n<p>Switch Player Right - <strong>RT</strong></p>\n<p>Select / Pause - <strong>Enter</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:29:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab7/ab7a2865406b0b511f1ca1344aae50bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BondysArcade"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
