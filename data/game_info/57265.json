It is the first game in the series and was originally released in 1994. A version for the Sega 32X, World Series Baseball starring Deion Sanders, would follow in 1995.<br />\nThe game was a major advancement in Sega baseball games in that it included licensed MLB players and teams (the first baseball video game to have both such licenses [previous baseball video games only had one license]; they are based on the rosters for the 1994 MLB season), and relatively accurate gameplay.<br />\nThe series concluded with World Series Baseball 2K3 on the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox. After that, Sega contracted with 2K Games to take over their sports game contracts and the line continued as the Major League Baseball 2K franchise.<br />\nSan Diego Padres broadcaster Jerry Coleman provides the play-by-play for the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-05T02:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/357/357d547e7167bf9a0d049513fbf93434.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis", "Game Gear", "SEGA Saturn", "Xbox"], "developers": ["BlueSky Software", "Blue Sky Software"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
