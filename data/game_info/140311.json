One of my inspirations has been GamesPlusJames. When I saw he has going to do a GameJam I knew I wanted to be a part of it. It wasn't the most convenient weekend; however, I was able to spend about 20 hours overall and get something I was kinda proud to submit.</p>\n<p>This was my 3rd GameJam and I always learn so much. It's a great way to change up the learning process,\u00a0to stop working on pure code, character/player/game mechanics, and attempting to try/implement\u00a0millions if ideas... and actually just focus, show some discipline, and\u00a0make playable game.</p>\n<p>Thanks James! Hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c80/c80dcbc47a748ad14e56d2331e774c5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["webthingee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
