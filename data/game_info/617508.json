Before you download this game I just want to say that it's very unfinished and has a couple of bugs. This is mainly due to the fact that on Sunday, because of some unexpected events, I was busy almost the entire day. Play this game if you like to play unfinished and buggy games.</strong></p>\n<p>This game is a 2D Platformer about jumping on enemies to stack together and get taller.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left and Right arrows or A and D keys for moving</p>\n<p>Space or W Key for jumping.</p>\n<p>R to restart the level</p>\n<p>This is my 3rd Game jam and I had a lot of fun.
