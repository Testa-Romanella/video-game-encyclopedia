Then the game unfolds and you choose which of the three heros you wish to be. Up to 3 of the women you meet become playable heroes.\n\nOuthouse Media have provided us with a teaser video which you can watch above.\n\nThe game has been designed to suit both men and women, but it's powerful for those who want to take a break from intense action. Here's hoping the game will make a return on its release.\n\nIt's scheduled to launch on the PC in March this year.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:40:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e0/2e04fba551a2ffc246b33637d797f6a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
