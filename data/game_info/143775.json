You've been put to the challenge of completing many difficult levels filled with obstacles and problem solving puzzles, can you do it? Use movable blocks to assist you, jump over sawblades, crouch under lasers, find keys to unlock doors and expect the unexpected, but under all circumstances, do not get decommissioned. (All Drudge Droids are recycled to house hold items such as toasters and microwaves. Rest assured that should you die you will live on) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/264/2649d06bc193be3494747fa98ded8ccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeityGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
