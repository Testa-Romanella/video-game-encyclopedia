Each player controlls one of rebel parties, trying to rise up against tyranny. Players goal is to encourage citizens to rise. To do so, each citizen has to be alerted by each player, by hearing their revolution shout (X on XBOX Controller) or seeing revolution sign (A on XBOX Controller) Player collects more points if he is the first one to encourage citizen, and less when he is the last one to do so. Beine spotted or heard by police while revolutionizing, increase awarness of government. If Revolution bar is filled, player with highest score wins, if Awarness bar is filled, revolution fails and no one wins. </p><p>Crafted by: <br/></p><p>Kacper Doma\u0144ski <br/>Patryk Ga\u0142ach <br/>Micha\u0142 K\u0142o\u015b <br/>Krzysztof Pachulski</p><p>With addition of some Kozilek fine tune: <br/>https://soundcloud.com/kozilek/black-sabbath-paranoid-kozilek1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6c02e72b704f2ca173ab9b21ab9a8b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kacper Doma\u0144ski"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
