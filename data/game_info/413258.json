Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never be had again. It is the recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events that once brought excitement, pleasure, and well-being, which now trigger the senses and makes one experience pain. However it acknowledges that to long for the past would detract from the excitement you feel towards the future. Saudade describes both happy and sad at the same time and is most closely translated to the English saying \u2018bitter sweet\u2019.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: This game is currently using Vietnamese, i will update the English version sometimes in near future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:38:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/685/685fd5c90b57e5bf3b251a02e44ee846.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lomite"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
