(He's an officer in a bucket (the NPCs removed all weapons in the game to stop you killing them)).</p>\n<p>So it is more or less a cutscene, you only have control of your camera, Officer Bucket moves you out of the game \"NPC Murder Party\" now painted over and titled \"No Player's Allowed! There is no game here, go away!\"</p><p>I'm not too happy with it but I am happy to give myself a crash course in using Unity and dabbling in some mini NPC AI behaviours.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T10:34:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd4/dd4c0daae48e63cd429cb3bdbf88491e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kouda Ha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
