Dodge traffic, hit boosts and perform near-misses to increase your combo meter, competing to get the high score on your machine's local leader-board.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created\u00a0as part of a 2-week game jam for my university course,\u00a0<strong><em>Hyperdrive</em></strong>\u00a0includes open source sound files from freesound.org and music from various artists. All other assets and code is created by me!</p><p>Please bear in mind this project is a prototype only! Game play and content is rather bare-bones. The game has been a learning experience for me, and I\u00a0both welcome and appreciate any feedback given in comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T04:30:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62f/62fc35bfbb8fed3bfde49a4a4480241b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valkija"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
