The Soviet Union and the United\u00a0States have joined forces to fight a much greater threat: the total annihilation of Earth by incoming asteroids!</p>\n<p>Leader of the Communist Party, Comrade Ronald Reagan has proposed a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a far reaching and comprehensive plan to protect Earth and her inhabitants from the encroaching space menace. This is where you come in. As a daring pilot of a starfighter, blast those space rocks to pebbles with your laser.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>#========================================================#</p>\n\n<p>Game Lore:</p>\n<p>By the 80s, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union had reached a boiling point. Both countries were armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons, and any misstep could have led to an all-out nuclear war that would have destroyed the world as we know it.<br/></p>\n<p>But then, something unexpected happened. A new leader emerged in the United States, one who was a staunch advocate of communism and believed that the only way to achieve true equality and justice was through socialism. His name was Ronald Reagan, and he had a vision for America that was radically different from anything that had come before.\r\n</p>\n<p>At first, many Americans were skeptical of Reagan's ideas. They had been raised to believe that communism was evil and that the Soviet Union was the enemy. But as Reagan began to implement his policies, people began to see the benefits of a socialist system. Healthcare was free for all, education was affordable, and income inequality was drastically reduced.\r\n</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev was also pursuing a new vision for his country. He saw the United States as a potential ally, and was willing to put aside the old animosities in order to forge a new relationship. The two leaders began to meet regularly, and soon, they developed a deep respect and friendship for each other.\r\n</p>\n<p>As the years passed, the United States and the Soviet Union became closer and closer. They began to work together on scientific research, environmental issues, and even space exploration. People traveled freely between the two countries, and cultural exchanges became common.\r\n</p>\n<p>Eventually, the two countries decided to merge into a single socialist state, known as the Union of Soviet Socialist\u00a0States (USSS). Under this new system, resources were distributed equally, and everyone had access to education, healthcare, and a good standard of living. The world was amazed by this turn of events, and many other countries began to follow their example.\r\n</p>\n<p>Together, they had developed a space program that was far more advanced than anything that had come before.\u00a0When an asteroid threatened to strike the Earth and cause widespread destruction, the USSS quickly mobilized to intercept it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They launched a joint mission with a team of astronauts from both countries, who were sent to intercept the asteroid before it reached Earth.\u00a0The team of astronauts worked together to develop a plan to destroy the asteroid. They used a combination of nuclear weapons and\u00a0high-powered lasers to break the asteroid into smaller pieces, which would burn up harmlessly in Earth's atmosphere.\u00a0The mission was risky and required a high level of cooperation between the two countries. But the astronauts were able to work\u00a0together seamlessly, despite their different backgrounds and cultures. They communicated effectively, sharing knowledge and resources\u00a0to ensure the success of the mission.</p>\n<p>In the end, their efforts paid off. The asteroid was destroyed, and the Earth was saved from certain destruction. The USSS received\u00a0widespread praise for their bravery and ingenuity, and their joint efforts were celebrated as a symbol of the new era of cooperation\u00a0and friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>\n\n\n<p>#========================================================#</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T07:16:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/801c161cb65e4534d45d0ace4ebda9b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kylelynn"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
