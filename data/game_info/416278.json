Try and get to the other side of the park to collect your very well deserved pets as fast as you can. Good boy!</p>\n<p>Made as part of HackTheBurgh 2020 \ud83d\udcbb</p>\r\nInspiration\r\n<p>We set out to make a wholesome and procedurally generated game. As with most hackathons, we ended up downgrading and made a wholesome game. Dogs were the first thing that came to mind when we thought about wholesome things. Anyway, what's cuter than a dog running towards its owner to get some pets!</p>\r\nWhat it does\r\n<p>Our beloved Dug can run forwards with D and backwards with A. You can also flex Dug with W and S, give it a shot. R to reset and Q to Woof!</p>\n<p>R to reset if you get stuck or want a different Dug :(</p>\r\nHow I built it\r\n<p>We built it in Unity. We made the sprites by drawing over photos and pictures on Photoshop.</p>\r\nChallenges I ran into\r\n<p>Making the physics quirky but stable and responsive was quite challenging. There ended up being not enough time to procedurally generate the map although you can remnants of the procedural generation in some environmental elements like the trees.</p>\r\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\r\n<p>The game has a very cohesive aesthetic. It looks and feels like a game, although it is extremely short.</p>\r\nWhat I learned\r\n<p>Unity Physics2D is much more a challenge than it may appear to be.</p>\r\nWhat's next for DUG\r\n<p>Tuned gameplay, longer level(s) and more toys (and more friends) for Dug to play with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T03:00:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d02/d021f7619af5b4ada232e2d57a9badf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SinanVanli"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
