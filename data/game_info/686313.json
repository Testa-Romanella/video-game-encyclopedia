Play sneaky tricks on your opponents to get the upper hand!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game plays like a typical card game. Players take turns, followed by the player on their right. <br/></p>\n<p>Players will take turns collecting 3 candies (pay special attention to their value and abilities, if you choose candies that synergize well, you can score big points!) Then players will take 1 turn playing a trick card.<br/></p>\n<p>First player to 100 points wins!</p>\n<p><strong>A note on multiplayer:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game uses port 34567 TCP/UDP, so make sure your firewall allows it if you are having issues finding a lobby. The lobby will automatically start the game 30-60 seconds after 2 players join to avoid long wait times for a multiplayer game.<br/></p>\n<p>I tried to work all the bugs out, but\u00a0due\u00a0to time constraints\u00a0I may have missed some.\u00a0If the server appears down\u00a0for\u00a0a long\u00a0period of time,\u00a0please\u00a0feel free to\u00a0let me know\u00a0and\u00a0I will take\u00a0a look.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T10:34:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f356b678a4112c73db4a82af52da271.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GameMeow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
