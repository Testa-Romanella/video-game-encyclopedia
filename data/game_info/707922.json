So Dracula takes them down in typical Vampire fashion: With a Machine Gun. Jk you can also bite them.<br/></p>\n<p>Enemies get angry if they see you in a mirror and have a line of sight. This is because you are a vampire, and vampires dont have mirror images (duh).<br/><br/>Bullets bounce off mirrors. If you shoot, enemies get angry\u00a0 so try to kill them\u00a0 in stealth by biting them - like a real vampire would. People might get angry if you bite their friends and they see you.<br/><br/>Mirrors are marked with a white bar above them<br/><br/>This game is very hard! Every bullet kills you instantly. This is obviously,\u00a0 because the baddies are well-equipped with silver bullets<br/><br/><strong>Team 7!!</strong><br/><br/>install:</p>\n<p>Windows: Extract EVERYTHING from Zip - use Vampire.exe<br/>Linux: Extract Everything - execute Metal Gear Dracula executable<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d3/0d339974a1552a71440b9b22107a8785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["dumrum"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
