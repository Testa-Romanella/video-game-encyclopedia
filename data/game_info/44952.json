We are currently looking for players who want to play the early version of the game and provide feedback.<br/><br/>   WHAT IS FUGL?Fugl is a sandbox game where you create the story, playing as a shapeshifting bird. Relax and feel the breeze under your wings as you glide serenely across picturesque landscapes, or kick up the excitement and soar up steep cliffs like an eagle. With no set rules the free roaming gameplay lets you discover the beauty and secrets of the world at your own pace and dares you to make your own meaning for a stress free experience. <br/><br/>Fugl\u2019s world is a vast and unique voxel playground. It is procedurally generated yet carefully crafted, with diverse areas to explore, from icy wind blown caves to tropical paradises to great deserts and old growth forests. Each environment is rich in diverse wildlife with hundreds of animals to find. You may even be lucky enough to stumble across rare mythical creatures. Come close to any of these creatures and you have the chance to take on new visual characteristics and flying behaviours inspired by them.<br/><br/>Give the world of Fugl your own creative touch by personalising it in the extensive level creator and craft your custom bird in the avatar editor. <br/><br/><strong>Features in the Alpha version:</strong><br/><ul><li>Freely control a bird and enjoy the thrill of flying <br/></li><li>Experience meditative and task free gameplay at your own pace<br/></li><li>Sink into the beautiful voxel art style<br/></li><li>Discover the vast carefully crafted world<br/></li><li> Explore varied areas - from tropical beaches to snowy mountains and alien worlds<br/></li><li>Take on new visual characteristics and flying behaviours inspired by other animals <br/></li><li>Make your own custom bird in the avatar editor<br/></li><li>Shape your personal world with the level creator<br/></li><li>Enjoy the relaxing soundtrack created with the sounds and ambience of nature<br/></li><li>Receive regular content updates throughout the Early Access, including new areas, new animals and new features</li></ul><br/><br/>   RoadmapWe are very proud of we have accomplished so far, but we still have a few things we'd like to add to the game, before we come out of Early Access.
