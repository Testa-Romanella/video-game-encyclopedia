Embark on a journey across a whimsical fantasy world with a cast of over 100 hand-drawn creatures to recruit and fuse. Each one has a unique set of abilities, resistances, and weaknesses across 11 elemental types.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBattle in turn-based combat across over 20 maps, including elemental hazards that you'll have to adapt to or work around. Monsters who absorb a hazard's element could even get free healing from it instead.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFusion is central to success. Your trusty starter will serve you well in the beginning, but you'll have to combine your monsters to make stronger ones in order to save the world. Offspring inherit their parents' abilities, so with careful breeding you can get any creature to learn any skill. Create a team that's truly a force to be reckoned with!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures full support for both controller and mouse/keyboard input.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T03:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6e/a6ea0fe817a7dfbcc53e8ed1747c2c5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Schnauzer Schtudios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Schnauzer Schtudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
