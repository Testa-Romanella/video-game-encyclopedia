Goal of the jam was to use only existing graphics, sounds and music to create something new. I made the game on the go because i was traveling a lot around christmas and NYE. For the jam, i wanted to make something nice with the monster sprites. I thought about what the monsters would do in their dungeon when no hero is around. And it had to meet my skill-level and scope, because i had so little time.<br/>The jam was fun and i learned a lot :)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>MONSTER SPEEDDATING</strong></p>\n\n<p>10 monsters are late to the dungeon-speeddate-event! Help them find the group with the most monsters they like. Every monster is different and likes different kinds and colors of monsters. But chose quickly: Each monster has only 3 seconds to find the right group!</p>\n<p>Select the groups with the <strong>up and down buttons</strong> and send the monster to the group with the <strong>X button</strong>.</p>\n<p>The more monster they like, the more points you get.</p>\n\n<p>Happy dating!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T03:52:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db8e163907c551211bc059c5b235ee34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lu_Bu"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
