Then the player enters words so the computer uses the formula to calculate a number - this is the watching mode. The player keeps entering words until he or she identifies the formula.<br/>When ready, the player switches to the guessing mode: now the computer chooses a word so the player can use the formula he or she believes the computer was using before. The player then enter a number. If the player guess is right, the computer picks a new formula and switches back to the watching mode. If the number is not correct, the player still has some chances to try again. It is also possible to switch back to watching mode anytime.</p>\n<p>As the player correctly guesses computer formulas, new levels are open and new formulas are learned by the computer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T01:53:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/202/202d6320196f789582c8728c02aa2b2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["papelgames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
