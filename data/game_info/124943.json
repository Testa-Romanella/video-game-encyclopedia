Halfway through the compo i decided to ditch the idea i was working on because i couldnt minimize the scope and startet all over again. <br/>Now i fear the scope is too small^^ <br/>This game is based on a Novel by Jorge Luis Borges, that i always wanted to put into a game format; The Library of Babel. Of course the time was too short to realise everything i had in mind for the game. Not unusual for Ludum Dare ;P <br/>So this game was mainly a test of my programming skills. You wander around in a library that streches infinitly and search the books, comprised of random letters, for your fate. <br/> <br/>So far there is not much game inside, no objective or end to be found. Just as someone finding him/herself in such a library. <br/> <br/>Interesting additions would be: <br/>-implementing other liberians or even multiplayer <br/>-adding objectives (eg finding something or someone) <br/> <br/>The Library of Babel is a really good read, btw :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35d/35d838854bc054dde0e3b669490e44e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ancientpixel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
