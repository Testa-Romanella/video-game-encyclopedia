The man decided to<strong> rent a room</strong> with good furnishings but with a <strong>price too good to be true</strong>. Only if he knew that once it's past 10 PM, the ones roaming the corridors aren't human anymore. Or maybe, the corridor <strong>ISN'T</strong> from the living realm anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Change Log v0.61</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Added full english translations to the current chapters (Make sure to change your language in the preferences.)</li><li>Added 2 more chapters since v0.5</li><li>Added 2 joke bad endings (these will be removed after the game dev. is finished.)</li><li>Complete UI change from v0.5</li></ul>\n<p>I'm not sure how to develop this game since it's my 4th day in Ren'Py.
