This demo was made in only a few weeks and it is my first NES project. <br/><br/></p>\r\nRecommended emulators:\r\n<p>I am providing a Mapper 30 version of the rom as well as a \"unrom hack\" version, which can run on older emulators. Choose whichever emulator you want. If you choose Mesen, I would recommend using NTSC filters so the image looks more like \"the real thing\".<br/><br/>You can also use a Everdrive cartridge and play it on a real Nintendo.</p>\r\nHow to launch the game:\r\n<p>- Choose your favourite emulator<br/>- Launch My Friendly A.I.
