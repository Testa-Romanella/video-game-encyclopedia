Hooray, the dangers of outsourcing!</p>\n<p>Feb 5, 2015.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's when newgrounds user 24901miles got around a thousand dollars worth of sticker paper in the mail and shared the news with the regulars of that time. By the time the next day had rolled around, discussion had started in earnest and newgrounds user Ronald-McDonald-LoL mentions that \"Sticker Tycoon\" would be, quote \"sounds like the worst video game ever.\" when 24901miles idly mentions dreams of being a Sticker Tycoon.</p>\n<p>That's when I started work on this game.</p>\n<p>I didn't even know half the things I know now back then. Four years in the making, constantly sidelined by other, more interesting projects until it stands no more a prototype experimental, but a fully operational business sim. I hope you have fun playing this game as much as I had fun making this thing for the last 4 years.</p>\n<p>This game is around 4.1Mb.
