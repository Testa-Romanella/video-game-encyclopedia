Your goal is to survive for as long as you can, while trying to break the highscores. To gain the maximum score, stay in combat and kill the enemies to increase your combo counter, which directly affects your score gained. Get hit or stay out of combat for too long and your combo will decrease. In short, kill everything that moves until the inevitable death reaches you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T06:50:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae7/ae7dac68118479d02fb35f31fbb7a04d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G\u00e4ng G\u00e4ng Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Ahlman Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
