The theme was Keep it alive. You have to nourish the little sunshine with water and sunlight while defending against hordes of evil bugs! Stay alive for two minutes and win the ultimate price :)<br/>It was a fantastic experience creating this game for the last 48 hours! I know that this game is not perfect and I know so many things to improve. Still, I would love to hear your opinion on it and recommendations to improve \"little sunshine\" enjoy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:51:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/054/0548250fd2c3de8c34035353debfc6d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Bloham"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
