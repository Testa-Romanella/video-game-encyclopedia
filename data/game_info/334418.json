{"id": 334418, "slug": "kingmaker", "name": "Kingmaker", "name_original": "Kingmaker", "description": "Kingmaker is a chess-like game with a few twists. The board has been expanded adding one more rank and file. This leaves one square in the middle of the board, the crown square. If your king reaches the middle before your opponents you win the game! But don't worry, the crown square is easily defendable. All standard chess pieces in the game now have unique abilities to help you defeat your opponent, as well as new original pieces with different abilities that you may chose to switch to adding a whole new layer of strategy on to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMost of the game rules are the same as chess. Pieces move as you would expect them to. However there is no check or checkmate, it is possible for you to lose the game if you to not pay attention to your king. Both players have a time limit, ten minutes each, if you run out of time you lose the game! Make sure that you are the kingmaker by getting your king to the center of the board!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T06:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/866e6b50ef159a0dbbb94be9a4b43b03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew McNeil", "T.M.
