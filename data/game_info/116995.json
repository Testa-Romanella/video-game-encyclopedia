So, in order to keep you visibility you have to drink potions, or cuddle up against a weird glowy purple circle thing. In order to progress you run through levels frantically looking for the next potion or safe spot as you become less and less visible, all while dodging Boglins (B and G swapped in Goblin, heh) of course.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns you can dm me through twitter (@TheFish523), or just comment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b686410659d8059d8eee1d357feb211.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FisherG"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
