You're the assistant to the mayor of a village where your local heroes tend to stop to stock up equipment, and your task is to satisfy their requests, maximizing profits while at the same time you're trying not to burnout from doing too many tasks at once.</p>\n<p>I added the fatigue mechanic because coupled with the time management core and the usual themes you can find in games of the genre (waiters, cooks, etc working themselves to death to maximise income) it felt like a great fit to the theme. However, I cut a couple of features that made the connection more obvious (A player avatar controlled with joystick/keyboard, and some in-between levels narrative scenes) , so it's a bit loose now.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Drag and drop with your mouse from resource node to craft node or from node to character face to fulfill a request. Most actions have a timer, so you can't drag a resource onto a busy node until it is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools/credits</strong>:<br/>* Unity 2019 as IDE.<br/>* Aseprite + Affinity Photo for art.<br/>* Trello for task tracking.<br/>I used a couple of free fonts from Dafont.com:<br/>\u00a0* [Minecraft](https://www.dafont.com/es/font-comment.php?file=minecraft)<br/>\u00a0* [Retro Gaming] (https://www.dafont.com/es/retro-gaming.font)</p>\n<p>I recently got a PO-20 (love it!) and a Midi controller and I would have loved to make some music, but I ran out of time.<br/><br/><strong>Changelog:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>29/04/2019</strong>: v0.0.3 (COMPO Submission).</li><li><strong>29/04/2019</strong>: v0.0.4\u00a0 COMPO Submission + Small UX fix: Target income should appear next to the earnings.
