Simple mechanics, nothing too crazy. Everyone should be able to grab a controller jump around, shoot, run and trash talk, but most importantly to HAVE FUN! with your buddies.\r\n</p>\n<p>I grew up playing games where the progress was lost after turning off the console. Well, that's what I wanted for this game, but I added a twist to it. Collecting coins YAY! Hey, wait a second! That has been done a million times. Well....true. But in my game, you collect coins to pay a toll. Now the coins are more meaningful.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Key features.\r\n</p>\n<p>0-Linear gameplay.\r\n</p>\n<p>1-Simple mechanics.

The way I think of it is \"boxy art style\". Yes, there are some pixel elements here and there. Because I wanted the freedom to mix pixel and boxy.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-SINGLE PLAYER\r\n</p>\n<p>Let's see how far you can make it. Each world has its unique challenges.\r\n</p>\n<p>-LOCAL CO-OP\r\n</p>\n<p>Up to 4 players.

Last man standing.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T09:16:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db8434fea5838593c402de1a82451dbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CouchBroGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
