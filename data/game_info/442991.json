I didn't like leaving it unfinished, so I've been steadily adding to it on and off over the last few months.</p>\n<p>I really admire speedrunning, so I tried to make this game as speedrun friendly as possible.</p>\n<p>I didn't really have any particular inspiration in mind when making the game. I teach programming in schools with Scratch and it was kind of based on one of the games I make in that. It ended up kind of Pac-Man-esque, in that you collect things and are in a kind of maze, but that's a bit of a stretch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T02:46:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b35/b351c653ec435261df6977cfb8d70bfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Extar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
