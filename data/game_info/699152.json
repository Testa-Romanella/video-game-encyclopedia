Become infamous to earn the right to fight against the best of the best! Control territory to ascend to the tops of the leaderboards!<br/><br/>GAME EVENTS &amp; MAP<br/>With the fall of society, comes a fresh opportunity to resettle the world. The world may look familiar, but new clans and organizations have taken over - this is your shot; join one and grow it from within, or form a new Clan and take over the map! Savvy players will check often to find new missions, war developments, and more! <br/><br/>STRATEGIZE WITH SQUADMATES<br/>You are not alone!
