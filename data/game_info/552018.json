The <strong>closer</strong> you kill the enemy to your base the <strong>more</strong> resources they drop. You use resources to buy more towers and fences or upgrade your HQ or towers (increases damage, but reduces range) and towers need to be restocked with ammo. You can reposition towers and fences throughout the game.<br/>Survive as long as you can.<br/><br/>Currently no sound, not much balancing.
