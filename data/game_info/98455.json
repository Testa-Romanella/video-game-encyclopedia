{"id": 98455, "slug": "intergalactic-diving-squad", "name": "Intergalactic Diving Squad", "name_original": "Intergalactic Diving Squad", "description": "<p><em>Intergalactic Diving Squad</em> is a collaborative dating sim made for DMG Toronto's  May 2015's Gym Jam. It's set 400 years into the future, where after a long period of war, the known universe is at peace, and celebrating that peace through sport. Unlike most dating sims, you don't just play as the main character, a second person plays as the romanceable character. It's kind of an experiment in consent, because I wanted to play with the idea of control that players have in games - I didn't want the player to be completely in control. There are no set rules for succeeding in the romance, or even for winning the games. The goal isn't to win or conquer, but to simply experience and enjoy.</p><p>Note: This is a demo, so it's not possible at this point to succeed in the romance, and it's not possible to get all of the endings. </p><strong>YOU WILL NEED:</strong><p>To play the Finals segment of the game, you will need to print out the judging cards provided in the .zip file. You can also roll a d10, though your score will be slightly less accurate since there will be no half scores. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf980b7330339ad44647e3f9c8eedab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["mkpatter"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
