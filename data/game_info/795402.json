It is obviously based on similar other games but easier because there is no gravity. Blocks can be freely moved up, down, left, and right with the arrow keys. They can be rotated with X or Y keys and can also be held for later use with C.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut my game also allows for a new feature that none of the other games have. It is possible to save the state of the game by pressing the . key and reload it with the , key to go back and correct mistakes. This makes it the perfect tool to test out playing styles which would be perfectly valid on other puzzle block style games but would be very difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConsider this game as a relaxing practice tool to test the limits of what you can think of when you have all the time in the world to get it right!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T03:48:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e67207209a70434bca7a0573cbbc5b4.jpg", "website": "https://github.com/chastitywhiterose/chastetris", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chastity White Rose"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chastity White Rose"], "esrb_rating": null}
