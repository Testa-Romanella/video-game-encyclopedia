Score-based. Your actions very quickly lead to no humans left, but you need hoomans for blood. Green jungles earn one point, lakes earn 5, and lake monsters are actually kinda slow so you might be able to toss additional 2 fellows. before they reach the final village.</p>\n<p>Yeah, this is not the pinnacle of game design, BUT, I have learned new framework and a lot of new Rust, and whatever.
