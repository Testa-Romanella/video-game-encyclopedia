The goal of the game is to find all sets of three adjacent symbols whose characteristics either match or differ. Each symbol has three characteristics: Color, Shape, and Shading. The color can be blue, green, or red. The shape can be a triangle, a circle, or a square. And the shading can be solid, striped, or empty. Each of these characteristics either need to be the same or different for three consecutive horizontal or vertical symbols to make a set. You beat the level when you've found all possible sets on the board.<br/><br/><br/>Over 100 Levels<br/>Steam Achievements<br/>Random Level Generator<br/>Colorblind friendly options in settings<br/>Relaxing and low pressure, no timer<br/><br/><br/>Find sets of three consecutive symbols whose characteristics either match or differ.<br/><br/>All three characteristics match (color, shape, and shading)<br/><br/><br/>One characteristic is different, two characteristics match (color and shape)<br/><br/><br/>Two characteristics are different, one characteristic matches (shading)<br/><br/><br/>All three characteristics are different<br/><br/><br/>See if you can find the set that meets the conditions on this board<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e1/4e12521df4ac569a8f372208ae8c0ab2.jpg", "website": "http://mindset-game.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 22}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Smokey Moose Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Smokey Moose Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
