As a team of 15 we had a lot of ideas for how we wanted to game to be and feel. We got together and looked at what we enjoyed in a game and we came up with a an idea to have a moving convoy, which players needed to protect along a route. After couple of iterations, TeamPunk is born.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard &amp; mouse:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Move the mouse to aim, Left mouse button to fire.</li><li>E to heal your character.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controller:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left analog to move.</li><li>Right analog to aim.</li><li>Right trigger to fire.</li><li>Left trigger to heal your character.</li></ul>\n<p>Singleplayer requires either a mouse and keyboard or a controller to play.
