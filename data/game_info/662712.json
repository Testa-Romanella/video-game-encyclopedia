{"id": 662712, "slug": "mechar", "name": "MechAR", "name_original": "MechAR", "description": "<p>Developed with\u00a0PabloDuck.</p>\n<p>Small game made as End of Term Project for a Human-Computer Interaction\u00a0course.\u00a0The game has been developed as a simple framework to be expanded upon in the future to create a more complete non-AR game with more enemies and gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>Meant to be played on mobile devices.\u00a0Mouse works too if playing the pc version.\r\n</p>\n<p>Choose your favorite arms (weapons) and head (special attack) to build your own mech and fight machine-gun and mortar armed tanks in a small arena. The game ends when the mech hit points reach zero or enough enemies have been killed.</p>\n<p>In AR mode you select the robot parts by scanning cards, then use another card to place the arena on a surface and play the game.\u00a0Be aware that\u00a0AR mode doesn't work correctly on certain devices.</p>\n\n<p>Controls and Instructions:\r\n</p>\n<p>- touch the floating piece over a card to select it.\u00a0Place at least three cards (two arms, one head) next to eachother and select them\u00a0to be able to build the mech. The leftmost arm card becomes the left arm, the rightmost becomes the right one.</p>\n<p>- In the arena, use the left stick to move the mech and the right one to change target.\u00a0Sticks appear when you touch the screen bottom-left and bottom-right sections. The mech automatically fires with a charged up weapon when the targeted enemy is in range and there's no obstacle between them (weapons such as mortar and laser ignore obstacles).</p>\n<p>- change active weapon with the top-right button.\u00a0Weapons recharge in a few seconds after every shots, even if they're inactive.</p>\n<p>- kill enemies to charge the special attack meter.\u00a0When it's full, use the special attack button under the weapon swap one to fire your special attack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T04:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8d/a8d7f3a9436f329562dfb47a54af9fb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Xe913"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
