Right. Well in Hypergalactic Psychic Table Tennis 3000, a bevy of devastating spells you shall have! Cast Fireball to incinerate the little invisible hairs on your opponent in an instant.

Especially when the ball is a square, right?! Get to it, buddy, get paddling those balls and smash them in the face of your foes. Smash your balls into the faces of everything you see. Hell, smash them on the walls if you have to... Don't worry they'll bounce off. Just get those balls wherever you think they need to go and trust me, you'll have some fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T00:46:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a455d1992187a6a618752333bd54e686.jpg", "website": "https://pong.lol", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Blue Wizard Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blue Wizard Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
