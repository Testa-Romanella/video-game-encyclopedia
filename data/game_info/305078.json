He has ushered in a utopia, however he now\u00a0has nothing left to accomplish. He spends\u00a0 years developing a\u00a0time machine in order to rewrite history, undoing all the\u00a0impactful films he's made and they are then replaced with the\u00a0films that the Tom Hanks we know and _____ has made.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong><br/> This is a logic puzzle game. You are provided several tiles<br/> which provide you the ability to launch a ball of energy and<br/> direct it to the nodes in the levels. You are tasked with<br/> destroying these nodes, as they are what hold together the<br/> timeline that Tom Hanks is trying to manipulate.</p>\n<p> Each level has a par time, which is the best* time possible.<br/> If you beat any of the par times, which I don't know if that<br/> is even possible, then be sure to let me and everyone you've<br/> ever known know how you did it!</p>\n<p> *<em>I cannot guarantee that there are not more optimal times. I<br/> designed the levels, but hey, I'm only human.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Info:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>This game only requires a mouse and functioning left and right buttons.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>You can press F4 to show debug information<ul><li>Hitting F4 will also set every level to \"complete\"</li><li>This unlocks the ending cutscene. It's funny, so I'm told.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>You can hit ESCAPE at any time to skip cutscenes/return to the menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e25/e2592a5c2ed9e116c1fb3a3a1663e459.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SAGiggs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
