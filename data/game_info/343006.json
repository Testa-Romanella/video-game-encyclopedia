His YouTube Channel is definitively worth checking out if you are planning on working with GameMaker Studio.</p>\n<p>The sound effects where made using bfxr.net and the background music comes from\u00a0ProductionCrate.</p>\r\nBugs, duh\r\n<p>Unfortunately background music doesn't seem to work in the web version. But because this doesn't really affect gameplay we still uploaded it for you to try out! Just remember that everything gets better with a bit of music, so consider downloading the Executable.
