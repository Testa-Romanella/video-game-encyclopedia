(Brain Digger)", "description": "<p>A local co-op game where two brothers have to protect their home from an intrusive bee.</p>\n<p>The game was developed with Godot with 3D assets made in Maya as a project for the screen based arts (animation) department in Bezalel Academy of Art and Design.\r\n</p>\n<p>It's designed to be a show floor game where people would come by, play a quick round and hopefully come out feeling something a little different. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, the game has never been shown at an exhibition.\r\n</p>\n<p>Players control with WASD and the arrow keys or with two gamepads.\r\n</p>\n<p>NOTE: Although it's possible, please do not play this game alone. It is meant to be played with two players.\r\n</p>\n<p>NOTE2: Load times may be very long and the frame may freeze for a minute after the loading bar completes. This game was made under a harsh deadline so there was no time to optimize assets. Once the game loads, it should run smoothly on most computers, including those with very basic GPUs.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T10:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/852/852bf2caf9df0a8231d921d04c7119e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brain Digger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
