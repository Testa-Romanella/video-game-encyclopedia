Luckily, MARC has the ability to switch his parts out in mid-combat. One moment dashing around the battlefield atop jet-thrusters firing laser cannons, and the next slapping enemies into oblivion with oversized hands while barreling through them atop tank treads. Robo Rob\u2019s creations are as dangerous as they are ridiculous and MARC will need to master them all if he ever hopes to escape!\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Garrett Evans</strong> - 3D\u00a0Modeling, Animation</p><p><strong>Gary Hansen</strong> - Programming, Animation, Level Design, Technical Art</p><p>Twitter,\u00a0ArtStation<br/></p><p><strong>Scott Mattes</strong> - Game Design, Level Design</p><p>Twitter,\u00a0ArtStation<br/></p><p><strong>Parker McAdams</strong> - 3D Modeling</p><p><strong>Sri Radhakrishnan</strong> - Sound Design,\u00a0UI</p><p><strong>Sam Vasquez</strong> - 3D Modeling, Texturing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:19:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/223/223de1272fc3996c52e9cc57955c015b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["samattes"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
