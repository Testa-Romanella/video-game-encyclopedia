Armed with a bow and a club, you'll have to face amazing and dealdly beasts such as:</p>\n<ul><li>Lernean Hydra</li><li>Stymphalian Birds</li><li>Cretan Bull</li><li>Mares of Diomedes</li><li>and even Cerberus</li></ul>\n<p>And not only that. You will also have to catch the Ceryneian Hind and the Erymanthian Boar, clean up Augean stable, bring Geryon\u2019s Bulls, find Hesperides\u2019 golden apples and convince Amazons to give you their queen's belt.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you won't be alone! Athena, the goddess of wisdom, art and just war, watches over Hercules. She would always guide him and shall a need occur, she would gift him with useful items.</p>\n<p>The labours are demanding. Sometimes you'll have to use your reflex, logical thinking and in some cases, it can be extremely helpful to know the myth. Each of them can be completed in any order, and as a reward, you will receive one of twelve items to complete your invetory with which the game will be even more interesting!</p>\n<p>There is also something for people hungry for challenges! <strong>36 achievements</strong> are just waiting to unlock them. Can you get them all?</p><p><em>The game is available in English and Polish.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T02:12:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ed/0edf914b04214c12bef0073a95da07bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patryqss"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
