The prompt was 'Escapism with a purpose'. So after convincing myself not to write an essay instead,\u00a0I made this game! It was kind of an excuse to write the shitty fantasy that I love, but it was also an attempt at making a point about projects and creativity. I've had a lot of people tell me my ideas aren't good at first, but I think eventually if you have faith in yourself and your creativity that you can develop a good idea into a fantastic result. Trust yourself! Take a chance! Like you do with your new fae friend :)</p><p>Also, many many thanks to my friends who play tested this an hour before it was due, you guys are the best &lt;3\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4c/f4c6d1da565492150f221f0fa9072cd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
