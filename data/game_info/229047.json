You can throw them at enemies and split their skulls!<br/><br/>It is very simple to do this - just tap on the screen and pull to aim and release to throw the ax. One accurate throw will be enough to put down any opponent. And there will be a lot of them! Among them are archers, armored swordsmen and even magicians.<br/>Therefore, to destroy them there are axes available for every taste in the game store, as well as a variety of shields and helmets to defend yourself from arrows and shells of magicians.<br/><br/>Also, the player versus player mode is implemented.<br/>Each player is on his turret and you need to hit an ax in your opponent before he splits your skull with his ax.<br/><br/>And do not worry if you die in the midst of a fight ... after all, Valhalla is waiting for you after death!!!*<br/><br/>Have a good game!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>* Valhalla does not apply to warriors who have defeated less than one opponent.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T13:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78fc35580393e35be4aefac28199f77a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["BYV"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
