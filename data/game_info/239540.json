Different enemies have different weapons, but unlike you- they only have one kind of weapon: some can attack you with their sword only if you are next to them and some can attack you from any distance with their shield or bow if you are in the same line as they are and not protected by walls.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8eb/8eb564314a4104b4edda05be39c7c7c8_dMCwVjr.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Liutauras Stravinskas"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Liutauras Stravinskas"], "esrb_rating": null}
