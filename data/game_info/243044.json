I find it pretty fun still. So here it is!</p>\n<p>Let's keep this simple, eh?<br/></p>\n<p>Due to some convoluted reason, portals to hell have popped up and you must use your weapons arsenal against them! Sounds easy right? Well they won't stop coming so count your bullets wisely.</p>\n<p>Whenever you pick up a weapon and later run out of ammo, you will gain a special move. Like when you run out of bullets on an Assault Rifle, shoot out a special something with the grenade launcher attached. What about a shotgun? Better pick it up like a bat and start swinging.. Now a hand gun? Better start using your hand..... It's a pun... you'll understand.</p>\n<p>As well as with the weapons, there's also a variety of enemies like our traditional Minions, Spotters who shoot rockets at you from their eye, and the Ravengers who will keep you looking out as they sprint past taking bites.</p>\n<p>Try the game out now! :D</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Move Around<br/>Mouse - Look Around<br/>Left Click - Shoot<br/>E - Pickup Weapon<br/>F - Kick</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>The monsters will spawn from the four corners of the map.<br/>Every weapon has a special move which you may use when ammo is depleted.<br/>Red bar : Health<br/>Orange Bar : Ammo</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Developed by Jacob Beimers</p>\n<p>Music by Teknoaxe<br/>(See teknoaxe.com)</p>\n<p>Sound Effects by freesfx.com &amp; soundbible.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e9f26f5033a78e8eaa0251fb1cf312b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RejectedJake"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
