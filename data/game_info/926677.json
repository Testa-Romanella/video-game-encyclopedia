All monsters in Erinia are based on Brazilian myths, such as the Sac\u00ed, and the spell system is based on Afro-Brazilian religious rituals (known as macumba). However, the world of Erinia is a basic medieval/fantasy world. The game takes place in the Tuorhence continent, in which are placed three cities: Aquilonius, Erynian and Hesperius, which are in constant war.
