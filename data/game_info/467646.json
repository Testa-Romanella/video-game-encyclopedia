You don't really have two sticks, there comes the name - SoloS(stick)S(hooter).</p>\n<p>You play as the mage Solo who was hijacked into a dungeon full of foes who want to get your magical heart sphere that gives you your power. Avoid them by any means and shoot them with your magical flame summoned by your heart sphere.</p>\n<p>But be careful! Your magical heart sphere is too strong to control so you can't aim where you send your power at and also the power is too great to defend against, so don't hit yourself.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Enter/Space/Left mouse button to shoot</p>\n\n<p>Game made by myself, Seva.</p>\n\n<p>Soundtrack by\u00a0https://musical-ear.itch.io</p>\n<p>SoundFX by\u00a0https://mythril-age.itch.io/mythril-age-sfx-pack-v1</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>Lucia</p>\n<p>Ratex</p>\n<p>GameMakersToolKit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78da7877d03608f4fa4e04aadc12f15d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sevatoxin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
