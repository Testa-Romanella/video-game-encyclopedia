Made Marion.<h3>A Romantic Action-Adventure Story</h3><br/>Made Marion is an otome visual novel - a romantic story primarily aimed at women, though of course all genders are welcome to play! It's inspired by the tales of Robin Hood, but with many of its own twists.<br/><br/>Welcome to Avalon, an alternate-world Medieval kingdom in which humanity exists in a sometimes-uneasy balance with the mystical fae folk. Avalon's hero-king Richard has gone missing, the nation is deep in debt from a recent war, and the commoners are agitating for more representation in government.<br/><br/>Step into the shoes of the proud young noblewoman Marion and guide her adventure in a richly-detailed fantasy world thick with political machinations and mystical intrigue.  Decide who to trust and who to love. Can Marion make the right choices to save Nottingham from a dire fate?<h3>Features:</h3><br/><strong>Gorgeous Graphics with a Celtic Flair:</strong> Enjoy our beautiful, expressive characters and a unique world inspired by a variety of Northern European cultures. Celtic design elements are threaded through our character and background designs.<br/><br/><strong>Proactive Heroine:</strong> Her name is in the game's title for a reason! Marion isn't just along for the ride; she drives the plot forward in many ways and has her own goals and desires.<br/><br/><strong>One Big Choice, Two Different Worlds:</strong> After the game's prologue, you'll make a big choice that either sends you to Sherwood Forest or the city of Nottingham. Each side has a different cast to romance, and the two sides have a different feeling to them. Sherwood is a swashbuckling action-adventure, while Nottingham has more political intrigue and spy hijinks.<br/><br/><strong>Role-Playing Choices:</strong> Instead of using a traditional affection meter, you'll be making major role-playing choices in each route that lead to two possible happy endings. Choose to be clever or straightforward with the flirtatious Robin. Make idealistic or pragmatic choices with Geoffrey and Gui. It's up to you, and you won't be punished with a bad end for your personality choices.<br/><br/><strong>Meaningful Bad Ends:</strong> Our bad endings are designed to be logical and interesting, giving hints about the wider story and world or showing a different side of the game's characters. They're also easily reversed, as they come from one-off choices.]<br/><br/><strong>Made for Adults:</strong> We're a sex-positive, LGBT-friendly otome game aimed at adult readers, with an over-18 cast. We aim to be mature without being \"edgy\" and to portray sex as a part of the characters' developing relationships.<h3>Meet the Love Interests</h3><br/><strong>Robin of Locksley:</strong> A deposed lord who is leading a rebellion against the autocratic Lord Geoffrey of Nottingham.
