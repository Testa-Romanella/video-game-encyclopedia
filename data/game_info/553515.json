Improving some of the flaws from the original, as well as adding new features such as a leveling up system, new secret playable characters, better graphics, modified level design in some levels, no more double jumping, but instead a Mega Man style jumping, and better yet, widescreen!</p>\n<p>It seems that someone has created an evil clone of you named Alexoor, who was created to kidnap all of your friends and take over your very own fantasy world which is based off your favorite childhood video games.</p>\n<p>You begin with one character, Alex, who embarks on a quest to rescue his friends, and stop the evil Alexoor from taking over your fantasy world. As you beat the different seven stages, you will unlock new friends to play as on your quest, and there will also be hidden characters in some of the levels that you can play as too.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Arrow Keys: Move<br/>Shift: Jump<br/>Z: Attack<br/>X: Special<br/>TAB: Exit Stage<br/>P: Pause Game<br/>ESC: Exit Game</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: If your computer detects the game as a virus, please do the following.
