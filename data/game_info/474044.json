For the NEON CITY GAME JAM 2 a game about a space courier. Thematic \"Space\".<br/>\u00a0It's a <strong>very early prototype</strong> but <strong>interesting for few minutes of gameplay\u00a0</strong> and an experiment of one of a playable and procedural ambiance scene that I could put in the game. Keys: <br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"W \"\"A\" \"S\" \"D\"</strong> to move forward and backward and left and right</p>\n<p>,<strong> \"A\" and \"E\" to turn.</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>\"Maj\" to thrust,</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>\"ScrollWheel\"</strong> to go up and down (bad implementation but you can try). <br/></p>\n<p>Try to follow the arrow,\u00a0 <strong>The Game have no end , and you will be a little hurt by the Universe.</strong> But say me if you want to see the misadventures of the space courier. It will be a short open world procedural game with ground phases. I already start the programing of the deliveries on his little bike. <br/></p>\n<p>Music is not mine it's a free music, I have the name noted somewhere\u00a0 but I am tired.</p>\n<p>All assets are free assets for this prototype, I will credit them in the next days.</p>\n<p>Asteroids field generator and ship piloting are made by me.<br/></p>\n<p>Game made with Unity. I am interested by your performance issues I want to make games that can be played by all. I didn't have the time to test with better graphisms for the asteroides like on the cover in the Timeline of the game Jam, My first asteroid generator was really impressive as you can see on the cover but maybe don't worth it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T04:28:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e26/e2696af38420c40be2e038d3481b2d1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack Mordred"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
