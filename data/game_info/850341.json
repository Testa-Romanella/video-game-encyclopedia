Fully infested pieces will not move back if moved and unmatched, however there is a good chance the piece they swap with will also be infested. If the map becomes too infested, they could trigger an event to swarm the map with obstacles</p>\r\nBoosters\r\n<p>Currently 12 basic boosters are available with plans to add many more. These boosters are charged from the matching of pieces on the map and can provide many advantages.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T10:59:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7caa1f2050a0b6c05a6f7a48373e357.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlueCactusJuice"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
