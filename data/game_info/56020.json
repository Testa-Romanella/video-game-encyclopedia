The story picks up five years after the movie Die Hard With a Vengeance, and you play as LA cop John McClane. Your daughter, now a full-grown woman on the police force, finds herself in danger, and it&#39;s up to you to save her. In your investigation, you&#39;ll meet old friends, uncover helpful clues, and solve objectives--all while using stealth or an arsenal of weaponry to move past enemies.</p>", "metacritic": 54, "released": "2002-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-08T12:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/833/8335a693e0ae216738d314224a09439e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["GameCube", "Xbox", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Bits Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
