Instead, you have to make the enemy hurt themselves on your blocks.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out!</strong></p>\n<p>You play as El Escozor, the world's greatest boxing cactus, in the title fight against the reigning champion, The Jacked Rabbit. Only problem: you're not allowed to fight back. Thankfully, your spiked body hurts him every time he attacks. And, with every successful block, your razor-sharp flower blooms a little bit more! Jab him with that and it will\u00a0<em>really\u00a0</em>hurt!</p>\n<p>Incomplete; you can neither win nor lose, there are no sound effects, few textures, the hit detection is wonky\u00a0and the animation is stiff.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:\u00a0</strong>Uses Arrow Keys or WASD.</p>\n<p><strong>Up / W:\u00a0</strong>High Block. Blocking reduces incoming damage and makes your flower bloom a little.</p>\n<p><strong>Down / S:\u00a0</strong>Low Block<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Right / D:\u00a0</strong>Dodge. Successful dodging restores some health<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left / A:\u00a0</strong>Headbutt. Can only be used when your flower blooms, and only causes damage if used during an enemy attack. Causes massive damage if it connects.<br/></p><p>Made with Unity, Blender, and FL Studio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/523/523cd9829ca61ca69c2fbf49e582dcd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NickHenley"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
