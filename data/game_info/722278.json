Spare your staff ! That is, unless you would want to see the train diversify itself with the compromise of making the game harder... But you wouldn't want that... would you ?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Leon Riskin for the music of our game !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T09:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/827/827c480e5336a520df06106a8b5cfe3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Speelux", "Shanice De Neef", "Glrglmrgl", "Arthur Treluyer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
