Throw globs around for extra excitement! The game is very short and \"ends\" with a gauntlet of 8 enemies with various power-ups and behaviors.</p>\n<p>The premise is that everything (health, buffs, weapons, etc.) is a \"glob\" which sticks to you and the AI. You can throw the globs back and forth to change the state of and damage your foes.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse + Keyboard (Recommended):</p>\n<ul><li>WASD -- Move</li><li>Mouse Move\u00a0-- Aim</li><li>Left-click\u00a0\u00a0-- Shoot</li><li>Right-click + Left-click -- Throw</li><li>Q/E -- Cycle Globs</li></ul>\n<p>Controller:</p>\n<ul><li>Left Joystick -- Move</li><li>Right Joystick -- Aim</li><li>Right Trigger -- Shoot</li><li>Left Trigger + Right Trigger -- Throw</li><li>LB/RB -- Cycle Globs</li></ul>\n<p>Keyboard Only:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD -- Move</li><li>Arrow Keys -- Aim</li><li>Space -- Shoot</li><li>Shift + Space -- Throw</li><li>Q/E -- Cycle Globs</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game Design</strong></p>\n<p>The basic idea is that all of your power-ups and life are represented as globs. When you touch a glob, it sticks to you. When it's stuck to you, it modifies your state (you have more health points, you can throw a fireball, you move slower, you are poisoned, etc.). Certain globs when thrown act as bombs (health and fireball) others incur status effects (snowball slows you down), and others caused damage over time (poison). When you get hurt, you drop/lose your globs. When you get hurt with no globs left, you die and respawn.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game when we finished ends up being a hectic twin-stick shooter with rapid inventory management (probably perfect for multiplayer gameplay). However, with some additional constraints it could easily be more of a puzzle game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs &amp; Issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Aiming perfectly\u00a0right with Controller switches back to aiming via mouse cursor</li><li>Sometimes globs get stuck in the environment</li><li>Sometimes the player camera glitches around</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f10/f101b120c69e3dc22e96a0bb37e90493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ChrisLHall", "nshkurkin", "thinquinn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
