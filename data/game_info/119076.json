Took me about 15 days to complete everything with the scripting and UI designing.</p>\n<p>This is also\u00a0my first completed game. As I was in a rush , the settings panel was left incomplete however, that will be fixed quite soon. I would love to get your feedback as it would help a beginning game developer like myself!
