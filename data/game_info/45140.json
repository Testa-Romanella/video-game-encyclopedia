At the moment when everything gets out of control, this girl will go through her biggest fears. <br/><br/>At 3 am, repeat the name of your doll 3 times and then say \"it's your turn\", immediately you have to leave him stabbed with a knife in the bathtub. All the lights of your house should be turned off, although you can use a dim light like a flashlight. Once this did this, it is time to hide, meanwhile you try to avoid the spirits to haunt your whole house. If the puppet finds you, it will stab you with the same object which you stabbed it. To finish the game, you have to survive until 6 in the morning to be able to shout \"I win\", as long as the spirits have not reached you before.<br/><br/>Are you ready to play it?<br/><br/>Features<br/><br/><ul><li>Hide to survive<br/></li><li>You will play from 3am until 6am.
