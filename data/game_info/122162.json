You do this by controlling the operators like you would in any other platforming game. For now I have made only 10 levels which should get progressively harder, I might add more in the future though.<br/></p>\n<p>To check if your answer is correct you hit the 'Enter' key, if nothing happens your answer is incorrect (there should never be two operators on one platform at the same time, because this will result in a wrong answer). If your answer is correct you will either go back to the level selection or move on to the next stage of the level.</p>\n<p>The controls can be found in the options menu, there you can also change some settings and clear your progress.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f1/3f1cc69e8f4eeb657e42b75082aa010c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Return Null"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
