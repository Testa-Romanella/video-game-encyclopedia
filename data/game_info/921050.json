There is just one problem - trees aren't very good at communicating, even with parts of themselves.</p>\n<p>Watch out for too much water (or the lack thereof), shake off bugs trying to eat your leaves, regulate your temperature and much more! (Disclaimer: we didn't have time so there isn't much more) Intuitive visual indicators will let you know what your tree needs. (Disclaimer: again, no time - blue=too much; red=too little)<br/></p>\n<p>We are <strong><em>rooting </em></strong>for you!</p>\n<p>All assets are created by us, background music is free to use.<br/>Use 1920x1080 resolution for best results.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>This game is played with \"T\" key only!</p>\n<p>Tree speaks in code:<br/>dot - short press<br/>dash - long press</p>\n<p>You chain words to commands, with each word being 3 characters long.</p>\n<p>Every word conveys meaning, and combined words (commands) can help bring resources to parts of the tree. You can see the state of the tree by the color of its parts.</p>\n<p>Show available commands command is one (dot-dot-dot) word long, use it often!</p>\n<p>You have to figure out what do the commands mean, and how to write them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T19:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/696/6962e10d66ffd1dc3af87bd39128d49c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
