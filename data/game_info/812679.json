My goal was to get a working combat system up and running by the end of the week, and I've got something that I hope communicates what I'm trying to achieve. I'll let you be the judge of my success! <br/></p>\n<p>There are some bugs involving incorrect collision maps in some of the combat rooms, but I don't think any of them require a reset... just some bumping around. There is only one perma-selected weapon and the monsters have no AI routines, nor even working animation. You also can't interact with any of the maze decorations yet.</p>\n<p>Controls in the maze:</p>\n<p>Up: Step forward</p>\n<p>Down: Step Backward</p>\n<p>Left: Turn Left</p>\n<p>Right: Turn Right</p>\n<p>Controls in Combat:</p>\n<p>D-Pad: Move Rho around as how you'd expect/Move the targeting reticle<br/></p>\n<p>A: Ready sword for attack/Execute attack</p>\n<p>B:Nothing/Cancel attack<br/></p>\n<p>Because of the quirky hardware, the screen will briefly flash or blink during transitions. I tried to minimize this with light shaded tilesets, but please be aware of it.<br/></p>\n<p>I intend to upload major updates here as I go, so any feedback is greatly appreciated!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T12:29:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a719332d9cd3de82eed5b664cc6b9390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Denebola Interactive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
