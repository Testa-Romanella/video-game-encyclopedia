All of the Assets were provided by the course.</p>\n<p>This is the last chapter of the course and it was a lot of fun! It was easier than I though to create a third person game with camera control and blending animations! As my focus was on the programming and gameplay part, I didn't focus on making my levels pretty.</p>\n<p>But compared to the course result, I added the table barriers with life count, made the robot movements completely different and made them work in lines, a little bit more like space invaders, but without getting closer.</p>\n<p>I also added multiple levels, and UI to indicate what level you are on! There are 5 levels in total, see you can beat the game!</p>\n<p>If you're interested in learning Godot, their course has been great for me!
