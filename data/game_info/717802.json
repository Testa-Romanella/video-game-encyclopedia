It is up to you to explore the area, talk to its residents and find out how you might be able to help them turn this situation around for the better.</p>\n\n<p><em>Create your own Matoran!</em></p>\n\n<p>This short Point-and-Click Adventure\u00a0Game is a tribute to the LEGO Group's\u00a0BIONICLE toy line and the Mata Nui Online Game, developed by Templar Studios, which did a wonderful job showcasing the early story of BIONICLE.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><em>Explore Onu-Koro!</em></p>\n\n\n<p>We developed this project as part of a Game Jam running over the course of a weekend this summer, but we had already done quite a bit of work in advance and continued to polish some things afterwards. So let's call it a Game Jam+... All in all we worked on this for about three weeks, whenever we had some time available. We finally got around to wrapping up the last few remaining things we felt should be done before we release this, and we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p><strong>@specsowl</strong>: Project Lead/Production, Environment Art, Programming, Quest Design<br/></p>\n<p><strong>@klulas_</strong>: Rigging, Animation, Programming, Sound Implementation</p>\n<p><strong>@skokees</strong>: Look Development, Character Art, UI Icons, Additional Environment Art</p>\n<p><strong>@cherkasskydan</strong>: Additional Animation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T05:28:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/485/48547c38090c866d691ef2bb742fe516.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BionicleJam"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
