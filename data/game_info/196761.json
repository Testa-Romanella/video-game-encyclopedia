Best of three, the Game! <br/> <br/>Here's the catch... The Queen has armed her own champion with a flamingo fit for battle. You however, must make do with a most uncooperative bird. <br/> <br/>Left : Retreat <br/>Right : Advance <br/>Up : Jump <br/>X : Thrust (holding Down for a low attack) <br/>C : Parry <br/> <br/>press \"R\" to Reset. <br/> <br/>======================== <br/>Here's how scoring works: <br/>======================== <br/> <br/>-Hitting your opponent with your flamingo's beak scores you a Point. The page (white rabbit) raises a flag indicating which payer scores first. <br/> <br/>-The painter on the left keeps track of Points by painting roses (black for you, red for the heart). First to 3 Points wins the Match. <br/> <br/>-The King of Hearts keeps track of the Match winner, raising a sign for heart or spade. This triggers the painter on the right. Best of 3 Matches wins the Game. <br/> <br/> <br/>====================== <br/>Notes on Clumsy Combat: <br/>====================== <br/> <br/>X and C (thrusting and blocking) will result in different motions based on the location/orientation of your flamingo's head/beak. Experiment to find the best times to attack or defend <br/> <br/>Trouble scoring points? Try following up a jump with a low attack, or thrusting after a well timed parry. <br/> <br/> <br/>If your flamingo gets tangled, mashing buttons may help. If you're really stuck, you can click (and drag) with the mouse. WARNING: this will probably result in some wonky physics! <br/> <br/>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb99efdf7926bf6a798a0535db754b63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["6\u2193"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
