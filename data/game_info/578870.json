My  goal was to create a similar environment and user experience. The question I want to address is: Did the environment and character  motion successfully create a simulation experience?\r\n </p>\r\n \r\nImplemented Features\r\n<ul><li>Press Spacebar to jump\r\n</li><li>WASD to move the character\r\n</li><li>Mouse to look around\r\n</li><li>A Score Counter\r\n</li><li>Obstacles to collide and/or destroy\r\n</li></ul>\r\n \r\nFeatures to implement\r\n<ul><li>Add Levels (more obstacle or harder to reach)\r\n</li><li>Restart the game if the player falls into the void/or into the forest\r\n</li><li>Option to increase the player's speed\r\n</li><li>Invisible walls and roof so the player does not fly outside the terrains\r\n</li><li>Option to switch or personalize carpet (optional)\r\n</li></ul>\r\n \r\nQuestions for play tester:\r\n<ul><li>What is your first impression of the game?\r\n</li><li>How difficult is the game?\r\n</li><li>How did understand the story of the game?\r\n</li><li>What aspect of the game do you find the most interesting?\r\n</li><li>What there any option you wanted to do that you could not?\r\n</li><li>If you had the power to change, add, or remove anything from the experience, what would it be?\r\n</li><li>How did you feel while completing the task (destroying the clouds)?\r\n</li><li>Which features did you test?\r\n</li><li>How much time did you take to explore the game?\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n \r\nFeedback from Playtesters\r\n<p><strong><em>Notes from the Play tests</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Issues</em>: One of the problems play testers encountered was the  lack of control of the air jump feature. Many pressed the space bar too  many times and ended up hovering over the clouds instead of destroying  them. Overall, the flying mechanic was hard to grasp and understand.  Some were able to destroy all the clouds, the rest were able to destroy a  few. The game was not hard to play, but it required lots of patience to  wait for the player to fall slowly. They all took between 5 to 10 mins  to test my game.\r\n </p>\n<p><em>Suggestions</em>: To speed up the fall, one play tester suggested  to increase the player\u2019s weight and gravity pull. If the user does not  maintain a certain height, they could fall faster and faster, or  whenever 3 clouds are destroyed, it gives them a speed boost (in which  they can use whenever they need). Someone else also suggested adding  plane-like control mechanics to create a stimulating experience closer  to reality. Adding a story \u2013 the reason why the player must destroy the  clouds \u2013, sound and more levels could improve the overall experience and  motivate the player to destroy the clouds. Live playtest Feedback: It would be nice to have an option to replay or  reset the game (return to the checkpoint).\r\n </p>\n<p><strong><em>Reflection on result of playtest</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Many play testers found familiarity once they opened my game. Some  compared it to Mario Kart with the playful environment and obstacles.  One play tester said that the obstacles on the ground were more  interesting to interact with than the flying mechanism and I can  certainly see why. I did enjoy kicking and tossing the obstacles as I  pass through them when I was building my game. I also predicted the  issue with the altitude when I pushed my last modification on GitHub,  and I suggested on my Wiki to add an invisible roof and wall instead to  reduce the risk of flying too high. It was amusing to see that someone  compared the path to Quebec roads with many construction signs. After  reading all the feedback, I realized that the question \u201cHow did you  understand the story of the game?\u201d was a little useless because I did  not include a story in my game. All the play testers were also confused  about that question. Overall, the play testers really enjoyed completing  the tasks (destroying the cloud) and felt satisfied of their  achievements. \u201cDestroying clouds is a hard business, I also questioned  my existence.\u201d is one of my favourite feedback so far.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T06:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/897ce483c1a8a5efbda4147709c25e18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eloracchao_k"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
