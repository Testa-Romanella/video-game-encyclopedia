It is an action game which uses full motion video (FMV) to display the on-screen action. The player must correctly choose the on-screen character's actions to progress the story. The pre-recorded animation for the game was produced by Toei Animation.</p>\n<p>The game is set in a fictional future where time travel is possible. The protagonist, Reika, travels to different time periods in search of a criminal, Luda, from her time. After successfully tracking down Luda, Reika prevents his plans to alter the past.</p>\n<p>Time Gal was inspired by the success of earlier laserdisc video games, most notably the 1983 title Dragon's Lair, which also used pre-recorded animation. The game was later ported to the Sega CD for a worldwide release, and also to the LaserActive in Japan. The home console versions received a mixed reception.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-11T19:37:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7be/7befd8c9a9a5a1eaf6b844e975eb7b42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "Classic Macintosh", "SEGA CD", "Commodore / Amiga", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
