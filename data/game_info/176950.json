The blocks are too heavy for one flybee, so both players must act together.</p><p><strong>You should <strong>really</strong> play this with two controllers</strong> (only tested with xbox controllers on mac) but you can use the keyboard as well:</p><p><em>W,A,S,D </em>: player1 movement<br/><em>Enter </em>: player1 grappling hook</p><p><em>Arrow keys </em>: player2 movement<br/><em>Space</em> : player2 grappling hook</p><p><strong>Hint: Start the game or change the game mode by grappling the text.</strong></p><p>I played with different game modes (time trail, time boni for stacked blocks,...). There's a config file, where you can modify different parameters.<br/></p><p>I still like the idea but on hold currently because it's a pain in the ass to playtest a 2 player coop game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c58/c58f91e6344f8b669781e2331a24e233.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Grille"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
