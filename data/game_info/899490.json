The wildlife outside of the facilities is adapting at an amazing rate. Even though they suffer through the harsh climate, they continue to evolve.  I think we may be able to use this to our advantage, we just need to figure out how. This may be our only chance.</p>\n<p><strong>Data log 22.</strong> After numerous autopsies we have discovered nothing. We have now started subjecting the apes to other harsh climates over long periods of time. We need to see if we can reproduce their evolutionary prowess in a controlled environment. We need to be able to harness the power of evolution, the fate of humanity rests upon it.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 35</strong> of being stationed at facility 2. I had to transfer stations once again, my old facility was condemned due to power limitations. They told us that the building could no longer support human life. How many more facilities need to be shut down, how many are even left? 15? I wonder how many more I\u2019m going to have to transfer to.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4869</strong> of being stationed at facility 13. Is this our salvation? This is what was promised? The world is uninhabitable. I thought that it (accelerationism) was supposed to push us into the stars and help us abandon this world. But here we are, living in a desolate wasteland. Is this what they wanted?</p>\n<p><strong>------ @\u30fb\ua20a\u30fb@ ------\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Created by Sisyphus Studios</strong><br/>Fall 2022 Traditional Game Development at the University of Utah</p>\n<p>Sora Roberts - Producer, UR&amp;UX, UI\u00a0Designer, 2D Artist, Minor Designer<br/>Silas Barber - Programmer, Texture Artist, VFX Artist<br/>Erik Zhang -\u00a0 Engineer<br/>Dimitrius Maritsas - Engineer<br/>Jiale Wei - 3D Artist<br/>Ji-hoon Kim - Designer, Writer, Minor 3D-modeler<br/>Carson Knowles - Designer, Writer, Producer, 3D-modeler</p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks to Prof. Matt Anderson!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T14:15:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c60/c601c0b8dbac90cfd11e43837329a2da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sorarosaurus"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
