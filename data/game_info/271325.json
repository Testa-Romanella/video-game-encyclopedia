Keep downloading your updates and sending your ideas!<br/><br/>Note: playing games drains your mobile / tablet battery quickly, so make sure to recharge. We've also had some bug reports in the X series of the launcher not working (game doesn't start), and crashes on phones which run gps and wifi optimisation apps. We think this is a root rom problem, we are working on it and will have an update soon. Just run the game again if you have any crashes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:01:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2c029535c8572993567bf0c450362f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martin Finch"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Martin Finch"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
