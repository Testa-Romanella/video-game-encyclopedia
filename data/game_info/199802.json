Basically its just like a platformer where you try and collect all the items but the items make you drunk. You also need to watch out for these red shirted fat guys who wanna beat you up for your beer so naturally the best thing to do is beat them up and take their beer (what else are you gonna do? try talking to them?). so ya dont fall from high places unless there is something soft to land on (wink, wink, hint, hint) and get all the beer in each level and then find the exit.</p>\n<p>quick note: a lot of people said the controls are wonky so try holding right click to make them better<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37f413731c1bfeea14c13d799be461c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["keckles"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
