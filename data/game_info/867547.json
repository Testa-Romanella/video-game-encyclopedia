Two armies with a limited amount of units fight on a 25\u2a0920 board. The game ends by occupying(thus destroying) the enemy's all\u00a0\ud83c\udfaaArsenals.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each player can move up to 5 units and attack 1 enemy per turn. The\u00a0\ud83d\udc34speed affects the unit's movement range in one turn.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The two main features are\u00a0combat\u00a0and\u00a0supply\u00a0settings\r\n</p>\n<p>Notice \"adjacent\" in this game means all 8 direction\r\n</p>\n<p>Combat</p>\n<p>There is no randomness in combat, and combat does not depend on single units. The game stress arranging and cooperating units to achieve high combat factors(i.e.\u00a0\u2694\ufe0fAttack and\u00a0\ud83d\udee1\ufe0fDefense), which decide the combat.\r\n</p>\n<p>Every unit radiates its factor in \u7c73 shape within its\u00a0\ud83c\udfafcombat range. You can see the units that provide\u00a0\u2694\ufe0fAtk and\u00a0\ud83d\udee1\ufe0fDef. The total values are the combat factor at that point. Some strongholds\u00a0\ud83c\udff0Fortress and\u00a0\ud83d\udee3\ufe0fMountain Pass can provide extra defense if they are occupied by\u00a0\ud83d\udc82Infantry or\u00a0\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude80Artillery.\r\n</p>\n<p>To attack an enemy you need to have a higher\u00a0\u2694\ufe0fAtk than its\u00a0\ud83d\udee1\ufe0fDef at that point, and if just higher than 1, the enemy has to\u00a0\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0fretreat this unit; otherwise, it will be\u00a0\ud83d\udc80captured.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u26a1Cavalry Charge</p>\n<p>Units usually provide higher\u00a0\ud83d\udee1\ufe0fDef than\u00a0\u2694\ufe0fAtk, so to break through the enemy's defense, you can use\u00a0\u26a1cavalry charge.\r\n</p>\n<p>Just let\u00a0\ud83c\udfc7cavalry be adjacent to the enemy's unit to toggle\u00a0\u26a1charge, and other\u00a0\ud83c\udfc7cavalries in the direction line also count. When\u00a0\ud83c\udfc7cavalry is in\u00a0\u26a1charge, its\u00a0\u2694\ufe0fAtk becomes 7, so totally you can get up to 28\u00a0\u2694\ufe0fAtk through\u00a0\u26a1charge.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are also some restrictions about the\u00a0\u26a1charge, such as one can not charge towards the unit in\u00a0\ud83c\udff0Fortress or\u00a0\ud83d\udee3\ufe0fMountain Pass.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Supply</p>\n<p>Units highly rely on supply, the unit\u00a0\ud83d\ude05out of supply can not move nor provide combat factors. Notice that supply could be cut by the enemy.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The supply originally emitted by\u00a0\ud83c\udfaaArsenal, also in \u7c73 shape with unlimited range, except be blocked by enemy's units or\u00a0\u26f0\ufe0fMountain. The\u00a0\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\ude9arelay units can redirect supply lines, and they even can move when they are\u00a0\ud83d\ude05out of supply.\r\n</p>\n<p>To be in supply, units must be on supply lines or adjacent to units that are in supply.\r\n</p>\n<p>Edit Mode</p>\n<p>Currently, the game provides a default opening. But you can customize your own with the editor mode.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You can Save and Load your game with the FEN-like notation. Merge game can add units to the board, which is useful for players to apply their deploy plans.\r\n</p>\r\nThe Other Implementation\r\n<p>There is another digital implementation:\u00a0Kriegspiel, made by Alex Galloway. There are an\u00a0interview\u00a0and a\u00a0playthrough\u00a0by Fred Serval. Unfortunately, it's only available on Mac and IOS, which inspires me to make a WEB version.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T15:27:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f4a6080a6e70d09894f96c11cf54541.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Poincare"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
