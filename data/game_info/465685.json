Then navigate your way to the white power pills and go into kill mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you've taken the pill you will constantly jet forward navigating by rotating to the left and right. In this mode crashing into enemies will kill them and net you points! Watch out though, crashing into walls while in kill mode is lethal to the player.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Made for the 2020 GMTK Game Jam - Out of Control</p><p>The game relates to the theme by forcing players to give up their relative control in order to kill enemies and\u00a0gain higher scores . The goal was to make the central mechanic one of engineering situations where you could 'safely' give up the relative control of the player character and crash through multiple enemies, but with enough variance that it was always a dicey move.</p>\n<p>Made with Godot - Mono 3.2.2</p>\n<p>Game by Kevin Virtue</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by Joseph Leroux</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c1/0c182f6cedd962bd196b99cb02675a32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["UsualVirtue"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
