Didn't even have to help him unload, only interact with him in the store's parking lot.  Seemed like an easy way to make a hundred bucks and even feel like a nice guy doing it, right?<br/><br/>Now I'm trapped.  There's barricades on the windows and doors and- well, there's something in here with me.  The cashier is gone and the only exit I can find is this... archway.  I don't know what scares me more Mary, that archway, the freaking wolf I saw wandering around, or whatever's making that chattering sound in the dark above me.  Now I'm huddled here behind a counter, whispering this message even though my phone won't <strong>god damn connect</strong>, hoping you get it somehow.  The kiosk has been calling my name, I'm going to see if I can get help on it.<br/><br/>All I wanted to do was get you that ring I've been hinting at Mary.  I'm sorry.  I love you.\"<br/><br/><br/>Last Chance Market, across from the Leng Forest Information Center, is a trusted stop and literal last chance to buy supplies for hikers and campers heading in to explore British Columbia\u2019s vast Coast Range wilderness.  Known by locals for its quality food, competitive prices, and quirky atmosphere, the store\u2019s mascot, Ellie the Elk, waits outside to greet shoppers.  With a wide selection of free range game meats, wild caught fish and fresh cooked delicacies, we can always find something to satisfy your cravings.<br/><br/>If you're heading into the wild Yaxala Valley, be sure to visit our hiking and camping section!  More people disappear in the wilderness beyond Last Chance than anywhere else in Canada each year.  With notoriously steep mountains, deep plunging ravines, and dense old growth forests obscuring trails, just getting where you want to be can be treacherous.  Aggressive wildlife and volatile weather only add dangers for the unprepared.  So whether you're hunting Leng's Lost Gold or going on a nature adventure, we can help you come back safe and sound.<br/><br/><br/>As the pawn of Yog-Sothoth, the player must survive and escape the store.  When facing a god determined to consume you or use you for parts, that's easier said than done.  Your only chance for survival is to unravel the mysteries surrounding the town and store, and use the ancient magics at play to find a door out.
