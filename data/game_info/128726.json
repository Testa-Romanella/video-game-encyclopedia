You will have to battle monsters (using both your machete and your pistol), avoid traps, solve a few puzzles and find secret treasure chambers.<br/></p>Review by <em>Games That I Play</em><p>This game features:</p><ul><li><strong>A labyrinthic dungeon full of mechanisms, traps, passages and locked doors</strong>. The path to your sworn enemy won't be a straight line...</li><li><strong>A humorous, quirky story</strong> featuring lots of silly and nerdy references. Wouldn't be a true idiotic adventure without them!</li><li><strong>Simple but challenging combat system.</strong> You'll have to fight different types of monsters using either your sword or your gun. You can also use the scenario to your advantage!</li><li><strong>Lots of collectible treasure</strong> in the form of sweets and pastries. Will you be able to fully conquer the dungeon and get the 100%...?</li><li><strong>Many secret areas</strong> hidden by fake walls and complex mechanisms.</li><li><strong>A </strong><strong>completely different (and harder) second quest</strong> that can be unlocked after beating the first adventure.</li><li><strong>Two special additional game modes</strong>: <em>Survival </em>and <em>Treasure Hunt</em>.</li><li><strong>Support for GameJolt's trophies and leaderboard system</strong>.</li><li><strong>A detailed in-game manual</strong> that can be read at any time. Or not. Either way, this means <em>no boring mandatory tutorials</em>!</li><li><strong>Really low system requirements</strong>. You can play the game even on an old Pentium 4 with 512MB RAM!</li><li><strong>English and Spanish language support</strong>.</li></ul><p><em>Adventures of Frikiboy</em> has been in the works for quite some time and we have released many expansion updates for it.
