Shot the right target based on the rule of the level. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>This game was created for <strong>My First Game Jam Winter 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is simple, follow the rule.<br/>If the player shot the right target, they'll get points. If the player shot the wrong target, they'll lose points and their health too. And if any of the target collide/'touch' the player, the player will lose their health. Observe the targets before you shot.</p>\n<p>The examples of some of the rules are:<br/>-Only shot target with &gt;6 edges<br/>-Avoid Octagon and Triangle<br/>-Only shot target with vertices greater than x, for 3x=4^2</p>\n<p>at least that was the rules that i planned for, unfortunately there's only one level with one rule. Because this game was made in hurry and in not so good situation.<br/></p>\n\n<p>There's also some items to help player:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>[Repair Kit] </strong><em>Restore player's health by 40-60</em><br/><strong>[Radial Scanner] </strong><em>Create a circle around player's cursor that will show geometrical properties of any targets inside the circle for 150 seconds.(Edges, Vertices and Axes)</em><br/><strong>[Shield] </strong><em>Create solid object in Player's direction which deflect any target for 10 seconds. but pass player's bullet</em><br/><strong>[Speed Booster] </strong><em>Increase Player's movement speed for 45 seconds.</em></p>\n<p>This game can be quite hard and frustating, the player's inventory has every one-time use item at the beginning of the game. You can buy them again with the points you have at the workshop area.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>W,A,S,D - Move<br/>Space,Mouse Button Left - Shoot<br/>Shift - Lock Cursor<br/>Q - Show Objective/Rule<br/>1 - Use Repair kit if available<br/>2 - Use Radial scanner if available<br/>3 - Use Shield if available<br/>4 - Use Speed Boost if available</p>\n<p>There's no shooting cooldown, but the red fragment from destroyed bullet/target will damage you, and also a stray bullet could hit the wrong target and damage you too. But don't worry if you missed a target accidentally, the bullet will destroyed after a while or after hit a solid object.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T10:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef9/ef93f463ec398dc7eb41b28061cbf786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevHaruya"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
