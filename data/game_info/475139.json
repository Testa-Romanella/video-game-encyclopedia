Even other oozes.</p>\n<p>Stripped of your gear and your levels, you've been beaten to 20% of your hit points and mana, and dumped down into The Depths, below The Dungeon, to be eaten alive by oozes that slink around down there, subsisting off scraps and bits of garbage and stuff, eating anything or anyone that falls down through the cracks from the levels above.</p>\n<p>Search The Depths, restore your health from the mana pools of water about the cave, re-arm yourself from the discarded chests you find, and fight the oozes to escape. (You might want to start with the blue ooze first.)</p>\n<p>The 'Wizard of Ooze' is a 10-level JRPG Dungeon Crawler in the style of the 80's Twenty-Five-Cent Arcade Video Games.\u00a0 Proceed level-by-level, fighting monsters, traversing mazes, solving puzzles, collecting items and armor and ultimately defeating the Wizard of Ooze.\u00a0 It's half Pac-Man, half Donkey Kong, a pinch of Zelda, and a whole lot of fun.</p>\n<p>This is my first game with the RGP Maker (MV) engine. And as a proof of concept I wanted to learn the engine, create a 10-level game in an Arcade style, figure out some specific mechanics not commonly showcased like 2-D towers, \"falling\", Arcade style movement, projectiles, faux-perspective, and how to engineer complex level-based puzzles. I also wanted to find a way to include self-promotion advertising that would not be intrusive to game-level screens and that could be turned off in a pay-for version.</p>\n<p>In a fast as possible play-through it takes 1 hours and 45 minutes to complete the game.\u00a0 Having to solve puzzles, figure out secrets, and learning game mechanics will extend game play time.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game contains:</p>\n<p>\u2022 10 Levels made up from 16 Screens<br/>\u2022 30 Enemies<br/>\u2022 5 Unique Armor Sets with Graphics<br/>\u2022 5 Secret Levels<br/>\u2022 9 Level Up Screens with Hints and Ads<br/>\u2022 Ability to Turn Off Hints in the Level Up Screens<br/>\u2022 Unlimited Deaths<br/>\u2022 New and Custom Graphics<br/>\u2022 New and Custom Audio</p>\n<p>There is a Play Online version at:<br/>https://webgamesetc.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T02:48:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed4c3c4f421904784382f6aa7333b5d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 382, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WebGamesEtc"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
