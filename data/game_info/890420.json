Boscoz Labs gets commissioned by a circus ringleader to create a portable funhouse with obstacles; knowing Quinn is the right man for this job, Boscoz Labs assigns this job to him. This doesn\u2019t upset Quinn however, since it\u2019s a dollhouse, a miniature structure he doesn\u2019t have to fully-interact with. After he\u2019s done with the project, he makes his way to Jerry\u2019s Shrink-Ray, to adjust some minor obstacles and details. But disaster strikes! Quinn accidentally slips, knocking over the ray, shrinking himself, and what are the odds? Landing inside the funhouse! Quinn is TERRIFIED, afraid of his own creation, but there\u2019s a reason why he's the best-of-the-best here in Boscoz Labs: Quinn has never turned in a project late, NEVER, and this won\u2019t be the first time! Now it\u2019s up to Quinn to get over his reasonable fear of clowns and anything circus related by going through this funhouse to fix his little situation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T07:33:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a114ab37f5912a02b9490de43a8a7004.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prisci11a"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
