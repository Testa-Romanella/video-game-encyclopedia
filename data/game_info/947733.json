Restless and half-dead, you have ventured into the temple that will allow you to cross over to the afterlife, but only if you can prove the righteousness of both your body and spirit through a series of trials.<br/></p>\n<p>The game allows 2 players to collaborate their way using their asymmetrical abilities through the levels of an Ancient Egyptian temple. One player plays as a body and one as a spirit, as they both can manipulate their own unique objects to progress the puzzles and help each other. The goal is to reach the end of the temple, prove their worth, and sail off to their afterlife! The game plays best using 2 gamepads.
