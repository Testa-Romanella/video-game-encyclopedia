Meet the locals of Wellbeing Town for an Animal-Crossing-like experience of completing objectives, exploring the environment, and collecting natural resources.</p>\n<p>Wellbeing Town was developed by a small team for The University of Bolton's Psychology department as an educational project, representing the Five Ways of Wellbeing. The game presents them as five different days (levels) which are the primary storyline of the game. After it is completed, a free-play version of the game is accessible.</p>\n<p>The project itself was completed in a month and a half and it is a prototype of what can be achieved in a similar project with a larger scope.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T06:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aae/aaee834141775416a1ff40afb63fe19e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tanya Madeva"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
