What it is.\r\n<p>I\u00a0come before you wielding naught but our standard and a <em>current</em> show of my efforts.\u00a0<strong><em>Project: Running-Man 2D</em></strong>, is as-advertised; the early alpha of a budding dream.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What this means, is that after years of merely dreaming to craft the worlds of my imagination into a gaming medium-- over the last year and a half or so, I'd finally started to teach myself (and be mentored) in the ways of design, coding, etc..</p>\n<p>So-- what we have here is where I currently am at.</p>\n<p>My team is busy with various other aspects of the League's operations-- and so I am left to my own devices in the construction of this title.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of titles-- while in early stages of production, the game will retain it's current name-- but as development continues <em>(all of which you'll see every step of the way, as I regularly update the files\u00a0<strong>and</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>\u00a0dev log here.)\u00a0</em>the final vision will take a more refined shape under a different moniker.</p>\n<p>Anyways-- the idea here is complete transparency for you folks. Until the game breaches out of early Alpha, it will remain free of charge. You\u00a0<em><strong>can\u00a0</strong></em>however donate if you see fit to do so.</p>\n<p>Your donations will be used in the following ways:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Outsourcing better Art Assets:</strong>\u00a0I\u00a0am a programmer, a writer, a leader of men, hell-- I am a Knight of Sealand, god save the Prince-- but an artist, I am not.\u00a0 All current assets you see are either free-use or pre-purchased. Eventually, a fully defined/refined art style will be required. This will help! Besides.. a title graphic would be nice.<br/><br/>This also means better promotional materials for a prettier page.. it's a little weaksauce over here, ain't it?</li><li><strong>Outsourcing Audio Assets</strong>: What's a game without some fancy sound effects, voice overs or music to go along with it? It's my hope that I can pay any and all who help me with my project by offering their talents-- until I can with some rev share, I'll purchase their souls services.</li><li>I\u00a0think you get the point...\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p>Every dollar\u00a0<em><strong>you</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></em>find yourselves generous enough to send our way, goes straight back into the development of the game.</p>\n\r\nSo what is it?!\r\n<p>Ah, yes-- the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>Project: Running-Man 2D</strong><strong>;\u00a0</strong></em>a side-scrolling '<em>metroidvania</em>' style action/adventure platformer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In it's current state, it features:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>A man</li><li>He Runs (and walks)</li><li>He Jumps\u00a0(and ducks)</li><li>He Attacks things!<br/>Though...not much to stab at currently..</li><li>He drops through platforms!</li><li>He takes damage and dies!<br/>Not only from the environment-- but from enemies as well! Though, the current build does not feature any enemies... Next one will.\u00a0Promise.</li><li>A pretty place to leap and/or frolic about through.</li><li>Messages to read! (Including a controls tutorial)</li><li>Death and re-spawning!</li></ul>\n<p>So as you can see, we're just drowning in things to do.</p>\n<p>Anyways-- this, as well as the Dev.\u00a0Log will be updated as time goes by.<br/><br/>I hope you like the game!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>We're adjourned~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:02:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/800/800ac998c845e72ace95d12ddcecedd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The-HBCL"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
