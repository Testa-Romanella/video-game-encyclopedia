Worked in the game industry, did some freelance, now I'm back creating indie games. For this project I wanted to create something unique by combining game design elements that were already out there. Connecting two dots with a freely drawn line was the core mechanic, and from there it was expanded into a diverse set of levels. I\u00a0hope you enjoy it\u00a0:)</p>\n<p><strong>Location</strong><br/>Toronto, Canada</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong><br/>September 6th 2017, $0.99<br/></p>\n<p>screenshots.zip</p>\n<p>support:</p>\n<p>http://www.twitter.com/michaelle55<br/>lynkgame55@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/7632f553b94f34ef3ec1f687a1ffe589.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chandler"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
