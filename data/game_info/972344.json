The game is based on a simple concept - the ground under your feet is constantly moving. Your goal is to score as many points as possible, dodge all the dangerous red worms and not fall into the abyss...<br/>The huge number of moving objects forces you to quickly find the best routes and show miracles of reaction to get to the top of the leaderboard!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T10:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/233/2335d08bd19f7a6c14deb098e8af4b3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LostVolBytes"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["LostVolBytes"], "esrb_rating": null}
