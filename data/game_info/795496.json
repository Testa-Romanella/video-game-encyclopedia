But to the boy who was new to CT city, gray is definitely the color he thought. All he could see in this city were shabby houses, ugly walls and smelly garbage cans everywhere. He had had unprecedented expectations for his new life in a new environment, but the merciless reality knocked him into the bottom of a dirty virtual valley.<br/><br/>Where is the hope? The hope isn\u2019t in anywhere of the city, but is the light deeply hided in the heart of the boy himself. Because he is enough innocent and imaginative to draw a colorful road in his mind to help him reach the beauty of this unpleasant city. However, the road is full of difficulties and the boy is too young to handle them. That is, you, in front of the screen, are capable to figure all the puzzling problems for him.<br/><br/>The city is abstractly formed with different cubes, because the world for such a young boy is simple and real, and the view of beauty and ugliness is absolutely fair. There is a special kind of cubes named \u201cimaginative cube\u201d in the city, which has special abilities like connecting a broken bridge, making a blocked tunnel passable, or opening a locked door. These imaginative cubes are the keys to help the boy find other colors in the city. However, the imaginative cubes are irregularly distributed everywhere because the boy\u2019s imagination is free and illogical. What you should do in CT city is to move the imaginative cube to help the boy pass all the roads towards better places and find real beauty of this city.<br/><br/>There\u2019re no lengthy words in the game because most parts of the story are presented by hand-drawn animations between each chapter with multiple shots which record what the boy see and experience all the way. The city is not economically developed, but mild, peaceful and inclusive. The only difference of the city is that the whole city is built above water. The reflection of the city in the water is quiet and elegant. As the city itself, unremarkable and unchanged all the time. It is the people who live here and see it every day always change.<br/><br/>\u201cDear passengers, welcome to CT city, we sincerely hope you will find your innocence and happiness here, and love this attractive city in the end.\u201d<br/><br/>The journey begins from now on.<br/><br/>Welcome to CT city.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T05:39:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda4433451ac677b81bfd5d5f4119fd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HuCang Studio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LightOn Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
