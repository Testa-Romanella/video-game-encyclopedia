Jumping on enemies (the red balls) will make them green. You can grab them once they're green. Grabbed enemies can be thrown or consumed for a powerful double or triple jump.</p>\n<p>It was originally intended to make a boss battle where the small minions would be used against the boss. But alas, the time limit was exceeded...</p>\n<p>The terrain is generated using Open Simplex noise and a Saw-tooth function. It's rendered by the marching cubes algorithm.</p>\n<p>That's it. Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T04:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e86/e8622922eb8b90d92de0b7937f1e1abb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alpear"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
