With a body resemblant of a bear but the head of a beast wolf, it has been known to be one of the most brutal and dangerous creatures in the city. Its name by the people: <strong>the Wildidoo</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>The violent nature of the <em>savous soliser</em> forces that even the most protective of coverings might not be enough to protect from damage against this mammal. Taming this animal requires its favorite type of food - it feasts on the flesh of beef blood solidified in the form of steak.</p>\n<p>One day, while a professional zookeeper was attempting to tame the creature, it ripped through the metal gates of its exhibit and ran amuck the entire zoo. With all of the tourists fleeing the fearsome creature, only you can lure this creature back into the cage where it belongs before it starts devouring the entire population!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T05:30:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a46/a468257cd272a65eb0bebc7135177e40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CGIXE"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
