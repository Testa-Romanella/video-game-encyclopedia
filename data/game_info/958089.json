Earth has collapsed, and people have been living on Mars for 35 years. In this time, a thrilling new sport has emerged - Baiju Drifters!<br/><br/>Our Nordic Game Jam 2023 submission embraces the themes of Regolith, Lubricity, and Baijiu in a unique and exciting way. Prepare to dive into a Mars-based arena, lubricated with Baijiu, where elite athletes from across the galaxy face off in an electrifying tournament.</p>\n<p>As a local multiplayer game for 2-4 players, you'll need to time your dives and slides just right to reach the scoring zone. But be warned! A timer adds a twist to the gameplay, with all players launching simultaneously and potentially crashing into one another.<br/><br/>Amidst the chaos, remember that daily Regolith storms require the arena to be cleaned and lubricated with Baijiu, the popular alcohol of the times. So, gather your friends, brace for impact, and join the ranks of the Baijiu Drifters in the ultimate test of skill and agility!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T14:54:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b60062addbd0e037ab04850c566ec58f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Florent Juchniewicz", "airka", "Surmoi"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
