I programmed, designed, and composed the audio for this game. I built this game for Ludum Dare 34 but updated it a year later with new powerups, animations, and menu features. I had a superb time playtesting it at MAGFest (below) but I don't plan to keep developing this game. I've open sourced the code and assets, so feel free to play around with them or use them to make something else quirky and fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2eb/2eb99ccd6505fed4716cc65638c47f8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ruthie Edwards"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
