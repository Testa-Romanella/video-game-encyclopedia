We have priced the game with the consideration to increase prices in the future with more content updates, somewhat like an early access title / pre-order. All proceeds will go towards game content.<br/>Early buyers get free content updates although if there isn't much interest in this genre, there's the risk of little future content. <br/>We appreciate all feedback and support (in terms of comments or reviews)!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b2/2b273a35afcc9d6a26544e5498ee1bb9.jpg", "website": "https://ignite-vr.com/9gridsvr/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Klexian"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ignite VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
