This was a really fun project because it incorporates a wide variety of mechanics and animations that need to work in tandem to be able to create a fun gameplay experience for the player. I took special care to make sure the assault rifle felt heavy to portray reality as well as give the player a satisfying feel when the rifle is fired. I also focused highly on creating bullet spread mechanics that would shift depending on firing modes and if the player is Aiming Down The Sight or not. The game loop is dependent on the player conserving ammunition and taking down all of the targets within the level.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T18:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f41/f4187e1d7a88ec64678dff21a014aec9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Konstantin Kanev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
