I want it to be better. The idea was received a year and half ago by me, when 2013 was ending. And it was made in Game Maker. Now I learned some more programming languages, so I decided, why do not make this game in .NET Framework?</p><p>But as time goes on making it, the system was starting to be more complicated, more unstable and more buggy. So I'm now planning the new engine, which will be more powerful and optimized, that I will make on incoming holidays.</p><p>As project is making, more ideas are coming. So expect more games soon. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c74/c74eb3588b5c39033b3090427a5a8032.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BigBang1112"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
