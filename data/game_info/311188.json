To make things worse, there is a storm coming, so you must not only survive the night, but also keep feeding the fire faster and faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>move with arrows (or WASD), space to feed the fire with the fuel. <br/><strong>Full-screen recommended.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bugs and limitations:</strong>\u00a0<br/>-- Gameplay: The game at the moment lacks a lose condition (monsters just scare the crap out of you, but dont kill you), there is no reset, and when the day arrives, the game does not end.<br/>-- Visuals: i barely designed the level assets, the characters have no animations<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/203/2035a6a29ff5ef00d87faecdad283d6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["solroo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
