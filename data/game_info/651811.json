If you get too close to the eye view of the characters in the room, they start getting aware of your presence, and the difficulty increases. Win if you get all the flags and go to the door at the end of the room or lose if the alert bar gets full.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:22:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef4/ef44fb39f2b7460d82bb93d826861b94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andreina De Sola"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
