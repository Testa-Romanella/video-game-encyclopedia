Nearing the middle of your playthrough, you end up managing many different stats and resources to build your city. If this idea does not sound fun or interesting you may not like this game.</p>\n<p>Mushroom Kingdom takes a bit of getting used to as there is no proper tutorial. If your confused at any step often times the \"Key\" button in the main menu may help you keep track of what resources are needed for what things.</p>\n<p>If you are okay with steep learning curves, relaxing city builders, and diverse or overwhelming options, Mushroom Kingdom should fit you very very well. It is in my best interest to not have you buy a game you won't want to play again.</p>\n\n<p>REPLAY VALUE: 3/5</p>\n<p>Upon completing a save, there isn't much new content other than late game achievements or extra content. You can do multiple playthroughs however Mushroom Kingdoms main cutscene oriented story is fairly linear. You may have a fun time building many different cities, however the general progression remains the same through each playthrough.</p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>DEVOLOPMENT</p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Mushroom Kingdom is still in development.</p>\n<p>Current Beta Build: 1.8.1.5 DEC 21 2022</p>\n\n<p>This game gets regular large updates and community ideas are welcomed.</p>\n\n<p>Bugs are to be submitted so they can slated for troubleshooting and debugging.
