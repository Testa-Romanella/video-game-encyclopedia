All that is necessary are some sacrifices. And milk.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Project Description:\u00a0</strong><br/>The objective of this project was to place emphasis on player interactions and environmental storytelling. Our group went HEAVY on player interactions and SUBTLE with environmental story telling. <br/>Just by playing the game you can tell there are many advanced mechanics that lead to a fun and fluid action-puzzle game.\u00a0 In addition to the regular walk around and jump, we've included wall-running and ziplining along with sword attacks that can deflect projectiles and parry blades. This leads to the puzzle mechanic on one of the levels.<br/>As for environmental story telling, we decided to use materials that showed a techy theme, as if we were in a testing chamber. We designed drones to attack the player to go along the techy theme.\u00a0 We made the final boss (and name of the game) a mad scientist to provide support that this is a facility of science. And we added particle effects or models as to indicate the interactable objects\u00a0(the godly milk at the end of most levels and the runes of ascension at the very end, to support the idea of attaining godhood at the end of the mad scientist's lair, and it is kind of a fun idea to have a payoff to the whole game)\u00a0.<br/>For the final requirement of the project, we need to have a complete game loop so that the player is allowed to play the game again once they finish.\u00a0So once they finish the game, there is a button that takes the player to the main menu and in the main menu the player can play again.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:<br/><a (fax=\"\" -=\"\" ]<dark=\"\" a=\"\" context=\"\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TygvVWbgUKY\" karlson=\"\" remix)=\"\" sensitive=\"\" synthwave]=\"\" vibe=\"\" youtube<=\"\">[Dark Synthwave] Context Sensitive - Karlson Vibe (Fax Remix) - YouTube - Fax<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM4jnyAf1n8</a>\u00a0- Void1<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeKMJYf1MM\u00a0- 4Tune<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPQii0-A98c\u00a0- Enrico<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9eC3WBRKeY\u00a0- Hugman<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T09:32:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7d/d7dd0a03ea5112c50c26627b620eef57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jeffreyliu321", "oam114", "Taneim"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
