{"id": 495311, "slug": "ciorcal", "name": "Ciorcal", "name_original": "Ciorcal", "description": "<p><strong>Setting / story:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Two nations occupy the earth: Kressyda - a democratic republic founded on elemental magical power (\"Elemtrisity\") - and Bowery - a communist dictatorship led by a hereditary line of Sultans.</li><li>Following an ancient conflict, the nations isolated themselves from each other for a thousand years. Now, they must come together in face of a challenge to the source of elemental power that is the basis of their respective societies.</li><li>The story follows two spoilt young socialites from Kressyda who end up on a whirlwind adventure by accident, and two rebellious young Bowerians who they meet along the way.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Original Graphics:\u00a0</strong>Worlds and monsters (some default RPG maker resources e.g. character/face graphics used).</li><li><strong>Weapon and armour upgrade system:\u00a0</strong>Search the world for parts which you can use to upgrade your weapons and armour. Each actor has a set of 10 weapons and 4 possible armours.</li><li><strong>Orb system:</strong>\u00a0Players attach orbs to their weapons and armour to allow them to use skills. Orbs also add elemental attack/defence, e.g. attaching a Red orb to your weapon increases your Red Elemental attack, and attaching the same orb to your armour increases Red Elemental defence. Additionally, orbs are also used to increase your stats, e.g. attaching an HP orb increases your max HP, attaching an Attack orb increases your strength stat.</li><li><strong>No levels!\u00a0</strong>Players do not gain experience or level up from battles. Instead, defeating enemies provides OP (Orb Particles) which level up any orbs you have currently attached. Therefore, stats are built by attaching levelled-up stats orbs. OP also level up your spells. This means stat bonuses and strong spells can be transferred from player to player with ease.</li><li><strong>Element system:\u00a0</strong>Attacking with an Element has a chance of changing the target to that Element, e.g. using a Red attack might turn the target Red. This adds a tactical challenge as players will not be able to use the same attacks repeatedly.</li><li><strong>Money system:\u00a0</strong>Monsters don't carry money or items (why would they?!) Instead, you earn money from villagers/townspeople through minigames (fishing!) or ridding their locales of monsters. You can also sell rare objects you find along the way for money.</li><li><strong>Love system:\u00a0</strong>Decisions you make in the game affect two of the actors' compatibility and end up in a possible romance. This story has LGBT interest.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd54305df89f99c56da9e15298469015.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ophiucus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
