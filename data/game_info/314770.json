Deploying after a ship leaves or is destroyed will have it in place for the next, unless no more ships show up that day.</li></ul>\n<p><strong> RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:<br/></strong>your resources are your life, but it's also your currency in space.\u00a0 Some aliens will sell you weapons and defenses in exchange for food, water, and oxygen.\u00a0 Once you run out of any resource, your crew will start to die off.\u00a0 Lack of oxygen kills the quickest, then water, then food.</p>\n<p><strong>TYPES OF SHIPS:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Alien fighters and Bombers</strong> - These will attack you unprovoked.\u00a0\u00a0You can defend yourself with a shield, or by killing them first with any of the three offensive weapons</li><li><strong>Alien merchants (sellers)</strong> - These aliens will sell you lasers, torpedoes, shields, and space mines in exchange for food, water, and oxygen.\u00a0 Your resources are valuable, so only buy what you need!</li><li><strong>Alien merchants\u00a0(buyers)</strong> - A little more rare, these will show up when you're very low on resources.\u00a0\u00a0They can sell you food, water, or air in exchange for some of your crew members.\u00a0 Why do they want your crew members? Best to not think about it.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>HOW TO WIN:</strong></p>\n<p>The goal is to get back to Earth. \u00a0You're 100 days out at the start of the game.\u00a0 Throughout the days, you might be attack or you might have opportunities to barter.\u00a0 You're not going to win every time, but the real fun is getting as far as you can each time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:32:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c6e91339da1a4ac4a94c5877bf0236.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shaolin Dave"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
