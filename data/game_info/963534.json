The music is everywhere, and it only gets louder as the main event approaches.<br/>Too bad it hurts you.<br/>You are tired of this. You have decided to seek a way out. However, it won\u2019t be easy...<br/><br/><strong>Playable misophonia</strong><br/>DETUNED is a bizarre game based on personal experiences with sensitivity to noise. It turns classic rhythm gameplay on its head: rather than hitting the notes of a song according to its beat, you need to avoid a randomly generated series of notes.<br/>However, running around trying to avoid pain is not a socially accepted way of life in this town. You have a job as a pearl collector. Every time you arrive in an area, a pearl might be hiding in the scenery. Attention and constant movement will be the keys to your survival.<br/><br/><strong>Twisted remixes</strong><br/>Every session of DETUNED is different. The songs will be remixed with gameplay changes every once in a while. Sometimes you\u2019ll get to choose how to suffer, other times it will be up to a dice roll. You might be able to obtain items to increase your chances of survival\u2026 but only if you have collected enough pearls. Even if you make to the festival\u2019s main event, there are 8 different endings depending on which special items you managed to get.<br/><br/><strong>Audiovisual insanity</strong><br/>DETUNED\u2019s graphics combine photographed doodles with pre-rendered lighting to create dreamlike images to look at while you succumb to stress. The songs haunting you are not the kind of music you know, but rather distorted recordings of random everyday noises.<br/><br/><strong>Bonus beats</strong><br/>Tired of the procedural generation? Reach at least 6 endings to unlock the song editor and produce your own creations of pure acoustic torture.<br/>Want more items in the store? Having the save files of previous entries on the \u201cApeHardware\u2019s Playable Freakshow\u201d bundle will unlock a bonus item for each game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-17T04:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e19/e19b043954077fc6df67a998e5e01f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ApeHardware"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ApeHardware"], "esrb_rating": null}
