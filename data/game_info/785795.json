{"id": 785795, "slug": "breathless-2", "name": "Breathless", "name_original": "Breathless", "description": "Breathless is an immersive virtual reality train ride through a dystopian landscape.  At it's core, Breathless is a music video created by electronic artist Croom featuring the vocal work of Berlin based experimental artist, Audriana Acu\u00f1a. Anchoring it is the masterful mixing work of Dylan Cameron (S U R V I V E, Troller), with his knack for bringing out exquisite and impactful bass without cluttering the haunting vocals and masterer Jess Labrador (Chasms). <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCroom worked with 3d environmental artists from around the world to help bring his vision to life.  Hasan Zeki G\u00f6\u011febakan from Istanbul, Turkey was the lead developer. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a short VR music video experience, not a game.  Users can view 360 degree angles, listening to the original song, while sitting stationary on a simulated train ride.   The Oculus 2 controls only the exit, pause, and start functions. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis VR experience requires an Oculus 2 headset, Windows 10,  and an Oculus Link connection enabled.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T04:45:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/531/5319b9fd3aa44d5cf853d34595ea1d24.jpg", "website": "https://www.croommusic.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hasan Zeki G\u00f6gebaken"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Croom Records"], "esrb_rating": null}
