He was an influence for me, as well as many others in Music ,Art and Games.\u00a0\u00a0In the game, cells can only survive if they can join together. If they do they can create things of wonderful complexity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0While John\u2019s cells joined together for survival, we have been forced to distance ourselves. I found this both ironic and tragic.\u00a0At this time, the hardest thing to keep alive is our sense of self.</p>\n<p>\u00a0This game is not intended to be played for long. Perhaps it isn\u2019t a game at all. \u00a0It is a space for your thoughts and reflections. You can use it how you like.\u00a0 I hope you have a great Game Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T09:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/250/25027d8e91e8dcd896452b5e9ab9596d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Owl_Skip"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
