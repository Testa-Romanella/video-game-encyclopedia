This was my first game jam and I'm quite happy with what I achieved.<br/><br/>The theme being \"death is only the beginning\" gave me a lot of ideas, but being a newbie, I've tried to do something achievable at my level. I wish I could have done a lot more but submitting something is already a good first step.<br/><br/>Thus here I am, with a very short game revolving around a soul trying to escape Hell.</p>\n<p>Credits: Assets made by me,\u00a0Acrem.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD or directionnal arrows.</p>\n<p>Known issues: Some collider problem with the last enemy type, it's possible to get\u00a0hit even when dodging. I'll fix it whenever I can.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T17:07:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/911/9113b45b9b35d661e8274b08d0141249.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acrem"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
