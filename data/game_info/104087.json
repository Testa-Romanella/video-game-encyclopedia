Johnson; Music by Devin Vibert</p><p>\r\n\tMaking our morning cup of coffee is, for many of us, ritualistic; it's a pattern we often choose not to end, whether because we are unwilling or unable to. <em>Morning Rituals</em> explores what might happen if we don't break free from that--or the consequences of succeeding.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tA 20-minute game built in Twine, complete with some visuals and a 3-song original soundtrack, <em>Morning Rituals</em> is about the our relationship with coffee, work, and life. It's an exploration of ritual and addiction, the demands of technology, and the balance of work and life.</p><p>It was originally commissioned for the Interactive Fiction Fund in May 2015.</p><p>~~Press Page~~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43c/43cec0fbe342611b3f4c2fec20a8a975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silverstring Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
