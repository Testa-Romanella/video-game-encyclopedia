You must use your newfound powers to traverse the dungeon (Except it only has one floor).</p>\n<p>The theme this time was -\u00a0'Your life is currency'. My interpretation was that nothing in the game was free and you needed to sacrifice a bit of your health for everything. To cast a spell, you need to wager a portion of your health bar. Get hit and the devil will take that portion away. Moreover, every passive ability power up will also lessen your max hp if you decide to equip them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly I had to cut\u00a0 a lot of features due to time constraints.\u00a0 I almost gave up on the project when the artist on my team had to leave due to RL issues.

I've fixed that along with some other game breaking\u00a0issues in the new version.
