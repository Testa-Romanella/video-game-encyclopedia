The Xeris are enacting their plans at galactic-wide domination. As the best pilot to ever live, the known universe will be wiped out or enslaved without your intervention. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCurrently in game: one singular replayable space battle. Defend the allied capital ship to win this onslaught! <br/>\r\nPlease be aware, Vallen is being released very early on in its production. Some moving objects have weird collision boundaries, capital ship AI is not the smartest and there are definitely some bugs. I am a solo game dev and am working on updates to improve the world, story, AI, etc. <br/>\r\nIn the near future, updates will expand the playable universe, and focus on remaking the game into an open world space fighter game.<br/>\r\n(Press Escape for pause menu and controls tab)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T03:40:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e76/e7685acd78a2928a2dbebe14780fbe9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rader Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rader Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
