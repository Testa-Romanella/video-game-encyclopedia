Most games call themselves \"retro\" but only appear that way graphically.  Everything about them is modern including game design, difficulty level, and they hold your hand through the entire game, that's not retro.  We DO NOT coddle you.  We grew up going from Atari 2600 in the 80s to the NES in the 90s facing the real Mike Tyson in Punch-Out!, trying to kill Jaws in the NES game, fighting through hordes of evil in Ghosts N' Goblins, and understanding the sewer system in the OG TMNT, all without hand-holding, YouTube to bail us out, or smart phones to give us every answer at the touch of a button.  The mission of Retro KO! is to show you, the gamer, that we know retro games and we're not giving into this current microwave generation that wants everything fast and handed to them without having to earn it.  We want you to laugh at the jokes, enjoy the game at your own pace, but also to feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat an opponent.  We want you to remember what it's like to have to scoot up to the screen, turn your hat backwards, and actually focus to beat a boss.  We're not for everyone, we know that, and we want it that way.  All that being said, we designed Retro KO! to make you <strong>LAUGH</strong>.  So, sit back, grab a adult beverage of choice and see if you're tough enough to make your way through the Venereousville Boxing ranks and defeat Tike Myson for all the glory!<br/><br/>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>VB Retro Knock-Out! is the first prequel chapter to VanillaBeast: Ace in the Hole.
