I did this with great pleasure while developing the project. I hope you will like it.\u00a0Good Luck!</p>\n\r\nDIFFICULTY LEVEL\r\n<p>Medium</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>W-A-S-D / Arrow Keys</p>\n\r\nTIPS\r\n<p>- White Lights are checkpoints.</p>\n<p>- There are checkpoints in front of the trampolines, if you can't jump successfully, jump down and you will be revived in front of the trampoline.</p>\n<p>- A-D / LEFT - RIGHT Arrow keys, you can speed up the ball a little by pressing these keys. It's actually a mistake, but I left it on purpose. It both increases the difficulty a little and adds extra speed.</p>\n\r\nResources\r\n<p>Trampoline Sound -\u00a0Freesound - \"trampoline bounce.wav\" by zepurple</p>\n<p>Ballon Burst -\u00a0\u00a0Freesound - \"Balloon_Burst_Pop_2.wav\" by Terhen</p><p>Trigger Beep -\u00a0Freesound - \"Bomb Countdown Beeps\" by snakebarney</p>\n<p>Ball Machine Shoot - Helix Jump Destroy Sound</p>\n<p>Game Music - Unity Prototype 3\u00a0</p>\n<p>Materials -\u00a0Textures for 3D, graphic design and Photoshop!</p><p><em>All models are made by me in blender and unity.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T13:39:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f8ffcc6788c3b0c7cf242b913368980.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KaLiniXK3"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
