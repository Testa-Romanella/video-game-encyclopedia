Still in super beta just wanted to let a few people try if they want! There is currently 2 levels and just exploring the character for now! First level there is 3 Bears coming down Main Staircase , destroy them! Then 4 more Bears will spawn near your temple, in the Southwest Corner. The Stairs lead To Apple The Rotten's Sanctuary, which I have not made walkable just yet! Have fun and let me know any direction I should take the game! Thank you, NeckBeard OUT!\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T18:36:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ffee488b60304846ff3ec26ca71672d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeckBeard Game Devs"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
