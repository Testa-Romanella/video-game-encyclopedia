It was made according to the rules of lost and forgotten systems and games. A game without the fancy graphics and system from todays games. A game you can sit down for and just play and enjoy. It can be hard it can be easy , it all depends on yourself.                                                <br/><br/>A labyrinth game based on the concept of the c64 game Druid. Simple graphics and simple game play which will keep you busy. A small but entertaining game. Find the keys and exit hidden in the labyrinths to proceed and try to stay alive while your playing. Old skool graphics and game play.<br/><br/><br/>- Total of six levels of big labyrinths<br/>- Bosses<br/>- Monsters<br/><br/>NOTE : THIS IS NOT A TRIPLE A GAME - ITS JUST A SIMPLE CASUAL GAME - <br/><br/>The game was build from scratch with Game Maker Sudio over a period of two years. Most of the graphics were completly made from scratch and a few are from other sources.<br/><br/>Controls are WASD with mouse.<br/><br/>You will like or hate this game.
