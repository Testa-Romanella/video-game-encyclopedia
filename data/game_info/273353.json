Click an ingredient and the correct measure. Or click the incorrect measure and make the Gnome sneeze.</p>\n<p>Continue adding an ingredient until it is gone. When they are all gone click the Gnome and he will stir it up for you. Click him again when you think he has stirred it enough.

It was originally made for a birthday card, and I hope it can bring some joy to you too.</p>\n<p>Enjoy your Peanut Sauce!</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Patrick</p>\n<p>On Patreon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb654deecd5494974f965b12566eeec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kneeling"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
