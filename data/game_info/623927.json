You, a demon, have to last an entire year while making sure that the Earth doesn't die. The moon requires cheese and the sun requires stars, but there are lots of hazards in space! Play this cute arcade game and try to survive your longest, maybe you'll be able to impress God and beat the game!</p>\n<p>~~ Credits and Thank yous ~~</p>\n<p>This is a game that I\u00a0designed for the GMTK Game Jam 2021. I\u00a0ran out of time to finish it within the limit, but I still wanted to finish it and upload it. This is the first game I\u00a0have fully created and uploaded to itch.io. All of the art was created by me. Sound credits go to ChipTone by Tom Vian, hmmm101 on freesound.org, and JonnyRuss01 on freesound.org. Also thanks to Jonathan for playtesting the game over and over and being moral support.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e7/1e796ef30a551f07daf384c0e9bb404c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bbutterscotch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
