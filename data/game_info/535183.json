Assuming a second-person perspective, players will assist the main character, Mr. Black (an American), to help him get through an unexpected week abroad in a variety of contexts. They will help Mr. Black (who becomes known as\u00a0<em>Monsieur Noir\u00a0</em>during his travels) as he hurriedly packs for a trip to France, travels to his destination, navigates the new town where he is staying, interacts with locals, enjoys some sightseeing, participates in activities, and eventually travels home. Players will help M. Noir complete each contextualized \u201cstage\u201d of this week by helping him identify the appropriate items, people, or places that he needs to use, visit, or interact with from among many plausible options he's thinking of. Because M. Noir has forgotten much of the French he learned long ago, the player is helping him to determine what he needs based on recalling the appropriate French words for them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T06:33:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebe7b17a354111142906ca70a18c8fb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stafforda"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
