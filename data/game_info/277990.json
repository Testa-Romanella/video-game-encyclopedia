Play the part of the blue team and learn about real cybersecurity controls, technology, methods, and strategies!Game PlayThreatGEN: Red vs. Blue is a turn-based strategy game played much like popular global domination board games. Rather than a world map, the \"game board\" consists of a computer network, which players compete for control over. Instead of simulated computer terminals, players choose and commit actions using \"action cards\" similar to a trading card game.By the Community... For the CommunityEvery single member of the development team for this game actually comes from the cybersecurity (or INFOSEC) community.
