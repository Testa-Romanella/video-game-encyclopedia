Thank you for your support!<br/><br/>======== User reviews ========<br/><br/>\u2022 &amp;quot;My husband and I can&amp;#39;t get enough of it.&amp;quot; - iCatriona<br/>\u2022 &amp;quot;This game is way too fun. I keep draining my battery playing it&amp;quot; - Ash mil<br/>\u2022 &amp;quot;The game starts out easy, but gets very, very challenging.&amp;quot; - Li3303<br/>\u2022 &amp;quot;Had this game few years now and still love it! Simple, addictive and just fun to play&amp;quot; - Nicnok76<br/>\u2022 &amp;quot;Once you figure out how to play it&amp;#39;s very hard to put it down.. &amp;quot; - Believe in Yourself<br/>\u2022 &amp;quot;You can play for 5 minutes or an hour. It&amp;#39;s the perfect pick up and put down game.&amp;quot; - Leggyj74<br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/><br/>\u2022 App Advice review: A challenging game that will definitely make you think twice about how easy it is to move a simple marker - 5/5<br/><br/>\u2022 From user Li3303:<br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/><br/>Normally I find this type of &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; game too frustrating, but this game has some awesome features:<br/><br/>1- being able to see what pieces will come up next- and where (I call them buds)<br/>2- an undo button that you can use 50 times per game<br/>3- a wild card flower<br/>4- a flower that when matched with five flowers of the same color will clear the board of that color<br/>5- being able to drastically reduce the number of flowers on the board three times<br/>6- the hexagon board grid<br/><br/>The game starts out easy, but gets very, very challenging. Games can take a long time (around 1-3 hrs), but it&amp;#39;s easy to put down and just pick up where you left off. Personally, I get more satisfaction from doing well on a longer more involved game than something that takes a few minutes. It&amp;#39;s almost perfect the way it is, but I would love to have a counter to keep track of how many undos I&amp;#39;ve used during the game. Highly recommended for puzzle fans!<br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/><br/>\u2022 Description:<br/>Flower Board is a highly addictive game.
