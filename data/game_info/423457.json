Online Jam #1 in 2020 as a solo project by Qazhax. The design constraint of the jam was 'Minimal instructions', so I tried to make the game simple enough to play even without any experience in games, without giving any explicit instructions on how to play the game.</p>\n<p>I really wanted to make it possible for the player to smooch other slimes but ran out of time for adding other slimes. Slime Smooching game next time? Maybe.</p>\n<ul><li>Programmer: Qazhax</li><li>Engine: Godot</li><li>Composer: Qazhax</li><li>Music tool: BeepBox</li><li>Sound effects: Sonniss GDC 2019</li><li>Artist: Qazhax</li><li>Sprite drawing tool: Clip Studio Paint</li><li>Tile drawing tool: Tilemancer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f4/5f48e125c3b93f6e1cb209f9cd00dc56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Qazhax"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
