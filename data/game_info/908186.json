Get to the door at the right of the level to win.\u00a0Nothing revolutionary but I\u00a0think I did the execution fairly well.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>A/D - move left/right</li><li>W - jump (hold to jump higher)</li></ul>\n<p>Max possible score should be 30 litres of oil.</p>\n<p>The game saves at the start of each level, so you can leave the webpage and come back if you beat only the first level.</p>\n<p>There are a few bugs I wasn't able to iron out. One is the player lagging behind by 1 frame when standing on a moving platform (like the leaping enemy). A workaround would be to make the graphic of the leaping enemy also lag behind by 1 frame but I don't like that solution.\u00a0I tried making a recursive \"push\" call for instances like this but that led to a tremendous rabbit hole that ended with learning that\u00a0Godot can't make immediate changes to the physics state, which is a shame.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T10:01:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24e/24ef30eb0bcee8f8cdc93b7c49f11f52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Airtoum"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
