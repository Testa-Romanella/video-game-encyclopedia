The theme for this jam was \"Hybrid.\"</p>\n<p>The Vision: A hero collector RPG mashed up with 5-draw poker. My mental pitch was a game that combined a standard hero collecting RPG commonly found for mobile platforms with a twist on the battle mechanics. Instead of a standard RPG turn-based battle system, your damage each round is dependent on 3 hands of 5-draw poker you play. The score of your hands combined with your team determines how much damage you do. Some players have special abilities to help you get the hands you need, such as swapping cards between hands or peeking at the deck at what is coming up next, so you can decide which cards to hold and which cards to re-draw.</p><p>Things I missed:</p><ul><li>More abilities/players</li><li>Ability cooldowns</li><li>Progression system. Like a typical hero collector, you should be able to level up your units to make their stats stronger and reduce their ability cooldowns (if they had them!)</li><li>Story progression. I wanted to include a handful of levels, but as is this \"game\" is really just a prototype of the battle system.</li></ul><p>This is the first game I\u00a0have ever made on Unity. I learned a lot of things and\u00a0 while I\u00a0 barely scratched the surface, the power of the engine has really piqued my interest in learning more about game design principles and game programming.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd6b3c5b799916f6cc3fd29f17d0e1fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ryantenorio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
