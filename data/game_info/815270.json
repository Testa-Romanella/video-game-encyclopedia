Days continue but the horde continue to require more animals to feast upon and begin attacking Seth for not sacrificing enough of his livestock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Try to survive for as many days as possible whilst the horde increases in size. Reach a high number of animal sacrifices to reduce the number of devils that appear! Catching the mythical Billy Goat is worth 3 so keep your eyes out!</p>\n<p>Leave a comment with your feedback and the number of days you survived and this page will update to show the highest scores!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I had run out of time to get music and sfx working. However, if this game shows some promise I will update with audio fixes.</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for playing!</p>\r\nName:Days Survived:Sacrifice Highscore:SchtarrLord513", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T05:03:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b8/1b85cf2de7f7500edd61272afa29acb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lucas-Rose"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
