It asks little of the player task wise, existing most so to be experienced and interacted with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I don't recommend playing this <strong>if you're epileptic.</strong> no jump scares, but there are flickers, patterns, slight perspective abnormalities, and infra-sound.  I had planned to make an epileptic safe version but realized i'm terribly unknowable on the subject and was unable to obtain the information necessary to declare it safe. Feedback on that is always welcome for future endeavors however.  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daf/dafe5b0620330197b31e61a387343c39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dapper_Zombie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
