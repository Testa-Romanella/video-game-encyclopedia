These chests are essential to the game\u2019s completion, because doors that give you access to areas that are required for progression will be locked unless you have a certain amount of wealth on you. You obtain this wealth by taking the treasure from these chests, or from picking up coins in levels. Obtaining chests will not be easy however, as you will have to do many different tasks ranging from platforming to puzzle solving (or maybe the chest will be right there and you\u2019ll be able to collect it without anything hindering you).</p>\n<p>The game is currently in-development but this build consists of two normal levels and a third boss level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f70/f70dae4d77f5efcf752f00fe60335d70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ADScomics"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
