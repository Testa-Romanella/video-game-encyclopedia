At your disposal is a well-trained fighter who is not afraid of difficulties and calmly enters into battle with superior enemy forces. Use improvised tools, such as rebars and knives, which are scattered across the levels to even the odds. Also, in particularly difficult situations, an ultimatum strike will help, which is able to scatter opponents around you, but remember, this strike has its own price and it is better not to abuse it. Do not forget about the treatment, otherwise you will not be able to go far! If you do not cope, you always have a chance to revive, the main thing is to use it wisely. Throws, jump kicks and grabs are your loyal allies! Forward fighter! Victory awaits! Prove that you are the best!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T02:38:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f28/f28dae614be3834ba6293247fc5be984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Falco Software", "kazakovstudios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KazakovStudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
