The more you play it, the harder it gets.  Race against your opponents.  Get in first place and win the race.  If you get behind, you must chase your opponents and pass them.  Simple to play, difficult to advance.  If you get past level 50, consider yourself a master Rally Racer.<br/><br/>ULTRA HIGH QUALITY GRAPHICS<br/>The graphics are ultra realistic using the latest 3D technology. We coupled the high quality graphics with great racing fun.  We used realistic looking Rally cars with an easy to understand interface.<br/><br/>CHALLENGE YOUR RACING LIMITS<br/>The more you race, the harder the game gets. There are 150 different tracks to choose from.  All of them are different.  Plenty of great rally racing options.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>The goal of the game is to be in 1st place for a certain amount of time.  The timer begins at 15 seconds and increases by 1 second each level.  The game difficulty increases the more levels you pass.  You select the track you want to play.  The tracks are not for a certain level.  For example, you can get to level 3 on track 5, and get to level 10 by racing on track 25.  All the tracks are different.  Some are easy to race, some are more difficult to race.  The blue checkpoints give you a turbo boost.  Use the white arrows to guide you. The arrows give you a rough pathway to travel on.  You are not required to follow exactly on the white line.  If you miss a checkpoint, you must go back and pass it for the race to continue.  The highest racing level you can get is 150.  <br/><br/>This app works best on quad core devices.  If you have less than a quad core, you may experience performance issues.  Please send us your feedback.  We are always trying to improve the quality of our games.
