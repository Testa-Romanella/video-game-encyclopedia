Then this game is for you!!1!</p>\n<p><strong>Who Stole My Bone?</strong> is a short Twine game made for the I Can't Draw game jam, starring an oddly shaped dog named Spudz. Become a detective with Spudz for 15-ish minutes as you try to find the culprit who stole his bone.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Contains brief language. You can go to Settings and turn on FF Mode (Family Friendly Mode) to replace big no-no words with\u00a0<em>small\u00a0</em>no-no words (i.e. h*ck).</p>\n<p>The mute buttons for the\u00a0music/sfx might seem like they're buggy, but they still work! I just suck at coding. Once you turn off music/sfx,\u00a0they will be in effect once you get out of Settings, like clicking on 'Main Menu'.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:06:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f00/f00f3a64a917361df0120cc71f997ead.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Noor Ashour"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
