Sorry :( ), next step is to move over a wheat field and click to harvest it. Harvested wheat goes to your inventory, and, after you harvest 10 wheat, you can harvest no more and you have to drop your wheat into cart in the top right. After you fully load the cart with 30 wheat, farmer comes and takes the cart away to unload it.</p>\r\nTools used:\r\n<p><strong>Game Engine:</strong> Unity</p>\n<p><strong>Visuals</strong>: Aseprite</p>\n<p><strong>Audio</strong>: FL Studio, Audacity</p>\n<p>I initially jumped in to learn how to make sounds for my games myself, and as you can kinda see I failed miserably at it. However, I still hope you'll enjoy playing this simple harvesting game!
