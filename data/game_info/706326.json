Currently it's only 3 demo levels that you can walk through. It is mainly for testing if I like the artstyle and if it works well with WebGL.<br/></p>\n<p>The main character of this game will be a queer girl in high school. The game itself will have 2 distinct phases. The day phase in the real world, where you have to talk to different npcs during schooltime and the night phase, with a world that changes depending on your decisions during the day.<br/></p>\n<p>In this demo is part of the main city, where if you go to the right side you can enter a forest path. In the forest path is a desert part to your right, where you can enter a cave through a hole in the stone.<br/></p>\n<p>You can also talk to some npcs via space and run while pressing the shift button.</p>\n<p>The pixel art was mainly made by finalbossblues which you can buy here, or are edits by me. The music is from the Colossal Game Music Collection. The duck and dragon sounds are from the Ultimate Sound FX Bundle.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:28:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6a/c6a95a05682c5454480762910c9e310a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Denini"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
