Answer ONE question wrong, and you have to go back to the start.</p>\n<p>There are 18 levels, and a boss battle at the end in which you play as a capybara with a gun who is trying to shoot down a red sussy baka. Then you get to watch the credits screen, which also has some funny pictures.</p>\n<p>(TLDR: This game is just 21st-century humour in a nutshell)</p>\n<p>This game is work in progress, so I will add new levels soon, and expect bugs! If you encounter any bugs, please report them in the comments!</p>\n<p>This game is also inspired by The Impossible Quiz and A.S.S., so if you end up liking this game (I'm sure you will) then you'll also like those too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T17:25:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe8/fe867da4f1fcdc6c28e45fb9f05b073d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kisaca-Pisaca"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
