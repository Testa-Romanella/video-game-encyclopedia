Very hard for some people and very easy for others.<br/>- MAP is available so you won't get lost and you can find some hints if you explore.<br/>- At least 6 hours of gameplay for new players and 12+ if you complete every achievement.<br/>- Inventory with 8 slots and an Universal Item Box so you can store your items when your inventory's full.<br/>- Some situations will require the player to take attention and observe the environment in order to proceed and they can be intentionally confusing sometimes.<br/>- Enemies are completely random which makes the replay factor more interesting.<br/>- Secrets are all over the place... you can find them while using the Camera, some of them are just... unexpected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To make unlocking multiple endings more dynamic, the gameplay is basically short once you learn where to go.<br/>This game was made with love! I'm a huge fan from the classics and true Survival Horror games. I did my best!<br/><br/>*This game was created by only one developer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T04:24:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c59/c5950fc1fb27a4fc7e999cf6055a967d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["OneManOnly Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["OneManOnly Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
