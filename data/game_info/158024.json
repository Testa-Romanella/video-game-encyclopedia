You name it and it\u2019s probably been in a fairytale one time or another. As a fairytale protagonist, the problem you\u2019ll be dealing with today are robbers. Robbers in fairytales are known for their evil intentions and brutal acts, not just their thievery, \u00a0and it\u2019s up to you to use your wits to survive until the end of the story. Can you outdo those known for their deception and potentially bring them to justice (or just live to see the end of the day)? Inspired by stories from the Grimm brothers, be clever and kind (and the right amount of attractive) and you might just outfox the robbers long enough for a happy ending.  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc5b9bddd3559544953724e9003ba86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lauren Smetzer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
