Follow the epic story of Sam as he battles the forces of evil on a motorcycle, battles the forces of evil on a train, battles the forces of evil on a building, and has a conversation with his girlfriend. Featuring voice acting by legendary actors such as some-guy-that-kind-of-sounds-like-Schwarzenegger and the-generic-villain-guy. Be sure to buy your ticket now - they won't be around for long! <br/><br/>Controls: Arrow Keys and Space for all levels <br/><br/>Gameplay: <br/>Level 1: Shoot cars to destroy them. Each one will take 2 hits. After defeating enough you can move on. <br/>Level 2: Make a dramatic choice at the end of the conversation, ultimately affecting the plot in absolutely no way! <br/>Level 3: Duck underneath the quick moving obstacles and bullets. While ducking you can't shoot. Kill both enemies to move on. Note: Colliding bullets destroy each other. <br/>Level 4: Hit the lit up arrow keys before the timer runs out! But be careful not to wait too long or hit the wrong ones! <br/><br/>Credits: <br/>Programming - Adam V. <br/>Lead Graphics Designer - Josh D. <br/>Cutscene Art - Christine N. <br/>Art for various screens - Paul K. <br/>Music - Kevin L. <br/>Voice Acting - Josh D., Adam V., Trevor R. <br/>Quality Assurance - Ryan G.
