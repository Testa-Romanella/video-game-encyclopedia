Rapid Angel fits the mold. \r\n<br/><br/>This combination beat-em up and platformer has something special for those with a subtle eye for Japanese ingenuity.  The graphics are very stylish and well-crafted. The game play goes back to the old days of running, jumping and fighting, picking up gems and coins for points and food to replenish your life. You can choose between three anime girls to be your heroine, each with her own fighting style. <br/><br/>\r\nThe characters all have personality and anime fans will feel the love with their voice. That anime humor is present too--like the sweatdrops appearing on you and the enemy when the enemy does something totally awkward or strange. You\u2019ll find yourself laughing at the character antics. <br/><br/>\r\nPlease Note:  This game is a direct import from Japan.  Although text is limited, the game is in the Japanese language.
