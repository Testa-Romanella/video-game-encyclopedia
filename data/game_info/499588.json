But is everything really as it seems?<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In Alter you set out on a mission to cleanse the world from corruption. To succeed in this task, you must learn how to traverse a large world using the powers gifted to you by the spirit mother, Keres and travel to ancient spirit worlds where you will destroy the trees causing corruption.
