We are NDA Games, and we are pleased to present you our project for a 48-hour gamejam.</p>\n<p>We were visited by the idea of\u00a0 \u00a0making recognizable chess a little more interesting for everyone, not only in the 2D dimension, but also in 3D! In our game, figures can walk not only forward and backward, but also up and down, in an 8x8 facet cube. Stylish design, convenient controls, and a lot of interesting experience are waiting for you!</p>\n\n<p>The game has three lighter levels with AI before playing with AI in a full-fledged classic chess game.</p>\n<p>Have played enough with AI and want to play with a friend? Not a problem! Especially for this there is a Hot Seat mode!</p>\n<p>We look forward to your constructive criticism and suggestions, they will help us in the further development of the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:33:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d6ba31729de99ef898b0be83424919f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LOVERDRIVE"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
