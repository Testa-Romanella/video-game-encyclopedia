Drive close to buildings or objects without crashing. The longer you are near objects, a point count builds up. To receive your points you have to retreat from the object or building without crashing. If you do crash, the streak is broken and you get 0 points. Luckily for you (and your car) you can slow time down--but there's a limit! The cool down in the bottom left is how much you can slow down. While it does slowly fill up, you can also have a streak of 100+ points to recharge significantly faster.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:<br/>Music: https://www.bensound.com (dream, dance)<br/>Car Sprite: tmdstudios.wordpress.com<br/>City Sprites: https://adamatomic.itch.io/gallet-city<br/>Skid marks: https://github.com/Nition/UnitySkidmarks<br/>Crash particle: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/fire-explosions/procedural-f...
