Yes, their bodies are actually solid gold!<br/></p>\n<p>Nobody really understands how it all started, but the only way leprechauns can procreate is by collecting gold and using their cauldron to make new leprechauns.<br/>So you see, leprechauns don\u2019t really store their gold in their cauldrons, the cauldrons are magical objects capable of giving life to the goal. You can always see if a cauldron is in use, that's when rainbows appear.</p>\n<p>But as Leprechaun and made of gold, they are hunted by a special kind of people. That would be, the once still believing in magic and fairy tales, and therefore especially children. Children that in life sought out money instead of candy, are damned to hunt leprechauns forever and ever, so leprechauns worst enemies.</p>\n<p>Collect all 100 coins, put them in the cauldron and extend your golden family.
