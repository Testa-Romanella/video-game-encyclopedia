The game features timing-based difficulties, which made it easy for them to get the team working together on time.\n\nParkinson Game is already available to pre-order on Outhouse Media, but the release date has not yet been announced.\n\nOuthouse Media\n\nDiscuss This Post</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:04:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/566841439b26fd53861e7178186cba0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
