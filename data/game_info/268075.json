I decided to challenge myself this fall to create a videogame about thanksgiving, to be published by thanksgiving, and it has been a wildly bumpy ride. However, I finally am able to publish the full (if unfinished) version. I put a lot of work into this game, and although it is far from perfect and I will never be happy with the state it is in, I am very proud :)</p><p>Drop some feedback in the comments if you have any ideas<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d8/6d8d3b40d3fc3e0816ad55b666f8902c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WillC_Squared"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
