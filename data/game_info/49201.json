Or you can go on the offense  with exploding turtle poo or with baby turtle calls. That's right, little baby turtle exploding poo, because that's how it is. You can also use turtle calls to find food and go on the offensive. Either way strategy is key because like a real baby turtle, you only have one life.<br/><br/>As a tiny baby turtle getting stuck on objects is a possibility and means certain death as you become helpless. Sometimes, you might get lucky and struggle your way off... predators are everywhere.<br/><br/>Beware of your nemesis, The Seagull, he will snatch you away. If he appears your only option is to hide, or run.
