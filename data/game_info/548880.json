Use a strategy and defeat your opponent.</p>\n<p>Currently only the<strong> two player version</strong> is available, I'm working on the single player version (it happens that programming the AI is very difficult for me hahaha).</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for downloading and I hope you enjoy it!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T07:27:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61c1c58741f0b4b88997b8239959d4a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdokinNadoki"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
