It is a platformer written in C using SDL2 in 72 hours. All of the assets were made during the jam period and most of the code was also written in this period except for some of the base engine. This base engine can be found in the SDL-Base folder in my GameDev GitHub which is linked below. There is a Web, Mac, and Windows build.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, you have to rush through the levels by using your dash ability as you constantly lose health each second and try to collect the coins as well for 100% completion. If you collide with the enemies, the game automatically breaks and if you finish the game, the game closes itself, there are about 4 small levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game starts with a screen in which a bar is moving down constantly which can be interpreted as your spacebar and once you press it or any other key on the keyboard, you can load into the actual game. I would suggest you download the native binaries for the individual platforms rather than the web build as if you collide with an enemy, the game ends and to restart you have to do, CMD + R or CTRL +\u00a0R.</p><p>In the topleft, the red bar, is your health, while the white bar, is your stamina, and there will also be a purplish color which represents how many coins you have collected, once you have collected all, the size of the collected coins bar will be the same as of an untouched stamina bar in which you haven't used even 1 stamina.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun making this game and I may make a devlog on it, if I feel like it.</p>\n<p>Note: Web build is slower and is not as fast as native binaries/builds..\u00a0I could not get it to build for Windows so I am very sorry for that</p>\n<p>The Controls:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Up Arrow - Jump Up</li><li>Down Arrow - Dash</li><li>Left Arrow - Move Left<br/>\n</li><li>Right Arrow - Move Right</li></ul>\n<p>The source code for this project is on my GitHub as well, in the folder called Ru5h.</p>\n<ul><li>C/C++ Game Dev</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:14:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7d/b7dcbbe2b2fd2dd608140e6ec7a122ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["DevHedronYT"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
