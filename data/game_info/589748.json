During the night, enemies come out and attack you. Ghosts spawn from dead enemies and chase you around the arena. The quicker you kill enemies, the more of them you can spawn.\r\n</p>\n<p>At the start of the day, all active ghosts will turn into coins. Collecting the coins as quickly as possible reveals a coin chest, and spawns extra ghosts that will make the next night more challenging.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>This is my submission to the #BulletHellJam2021. A small game made over the course of 5 days, built around two themes - bullet hell and \"10 seconds\". Despite it's focus on scoring, don't treat it too seriously because luck will play a big part past a certain point. Most assets are original, but some sounds were recycled from Mechanical Star Astra &amp; the basic skeleton is based off the one in Pocky &amp; Rocky. Hope you enjoy!<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>If you liked it, please consider buying it as a donation for the development of my other games.<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T06:36:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/561b630c5dd8fb80604219f78f918f75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boghog"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
