The weapons and the enemies you'll find also scale with the level you are, so as the game gets tougher the weapons you can get will have a more important role.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>This game is not finished.

I know that there are a few bugs and\u00a0 probably some more that I have still not figured out. However, the game can be played withour major issues, but it may crash if you get to a really high level due to some limitations on the generation algorithm. In conclusion, the game is still far from a final product, but given the fact that it was developed during a month, I think it can still be enjoyed.</p>\n<p>There are other builds available, such as Windows, Linux and MacOS.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>More notes<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This is the first game I've uploaded to itch.io, and despite the fact that the game is still not finished I have had some fun while playing it myself, and I thought that maybe some one out there would too. So that's the main reason why I decided to upload it.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets List<br/></strong></p>\n<p>All the assets that were used to develop this demo are free to use and they are available at the Unity Asset Store:</p>\n<p>\u00a0-Sci-Fi Gun Light: http://u3d.as/NG7<br/>\u00a0- Simple Box Pack: http://u3d.as/1U4<br/>\u00a0- Unity Particle Pack: http://u3d.as/BZ7<br/>\u00a0- Fog of War Gun Sound FX Free: http://u3d.as/wbH<br/>\u00a0- Weapon Soldier Sounds Pack: http://u3d.as/byo<br/>\u00a0- 3D Scifi Kit Starter Kit: http://u3d.as/RE9<br/>\u00a0- Sci-Fi Door: http://u3d.as/9hZ<br/>\u00a0- Handpainted Keys: http://u3d.as/i6q<br/>\u00a0- SciFi Enemies and Vehicles: http://u3d.as/6CD<br/>\u00a0- Nextgen Sci-Fi: Cratehttp://u3d.as/jze</p>\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p><p>https://github.com/TFGProcGen/DungeonGen<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7fc002fa95761f694cd0c67ba50ca30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Defu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
