Often termed \"Slayers in Space\" Lost Universe is a fun anime that holds a place for us as one of the first we ever saw. Fans of the characters, when the fan-game contest by Nackster started we almost immediately decided to make what is probably the first Lost Universe-based game ever.<br/><br/><strong>I meant the game genius!</strong><br/><br/>Oh, well, the game is a platformer and a shooter mixed into one. Our first adventure with 3D in GameMaker (and at all!) there was a lot to learn and experiment with.<br/><br/>Platforming elements mixed with melee and ranged combat, space combat, and music right from the Best of Soundtrack for the series (sorry for the J-Pop!) Lost Universe was an ambitious project that we're glad to see done for now. Smile<br/><br/><br/><strong>Anyone wanted to know who was responsible? Eh? Where'd everyone go?</strong><br/><br/>Anamei Productions<br/>Jump Ultimate Stars (base sprites used for the characters!)<br/>MusicShake (for the Desert and VR levels)<br/>Lost Universe for the Series and Best of Soundtrack for the rest of the music and my sound effects!<br/><br/>Beta Testers:<br/>ArtBane<br/>Ocean's Dream</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T07:02:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73c/73cb64cbbde7d06881000a19107ea9fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaskedIntrovert"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
