{"id": 470685, "slug": "neon-hopper", "name": "Neon Hopper", "name_original": "Neon Hopper", "description": "<p>This was a summer project i decided to work on, my personal goal for \"Neon Hopper\" is to release my first ever priced game.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\"Neon Hopper\" is inspired from B hopping that comes from old generation games where movement wasn't perfect, These type of games inspired thousands of speed runners to partake in timed runs. The names of games that inspired this the most were (Doom 1 - 3, CS:Source, CS:GO, Half Life\u00a01 -2 and Quake) The movement of this game takes inspiration from these titles and is close to emulating the movement\u00a0 that these titles were known for.\u00a0</p><p>This game would be a perfect steppign stool for learning how to speed run with such movement, as it provides the player after completion with the follwing skills\u00a0(Strafing left and Right, timing when to jump, gaining speed from certain angles of the map, mid air control, and over all jumping accuracy)\u00a0</p><p>The game isnt built to be the hardest parkour game, but it does challenge the player to learn basic to intermediate movement based on the challenges that await.</p><p>!Note you do not need to read the below, however if you do you will be supporting the developer of this title very much....</p><p>I'd like to say first for\u00a0all if you are here and even checking out the game but not thinking of buying it, all i want to say is thank you for looking and i hope i make a game in the future that is suitable for you, For those that have bought the game, this is my very first 3D game and i hope you have enjoyed it however criticism is always welcome, For the final note If you can please donate to the developer through his other games as it would really help his current Situation with Game development. Thank You ! You Guys are awsome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T04:06:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d60/d606973c8e21809db3a817041212e8a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dagaru"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
