It was created in 3 days (for 8x8 Game Jam 2 hosted by SuperGamersGames)! WOOHOO! This was only meant to be a silly little foray into Game Jams, but the little critters grew on us, so we might update this down the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Simple tower defense. Click on the two tower options at the top and build on the map. Esc if you want to pause the game or restart.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>BitScript font by usr_share.</p>\n<p>Fast fight / battle music by Ville Nousiainen</p>\n<p>Everything else homecooked by Studio Mooli!
