The main game revolves around the story of Damani and Rocco, who's memes have gotten out of hand. They must now gather their guns, weapons, and armor, and stop the memes of their own creation.\r\n\n<p>While applying to a Game Development\\Design college, this release of DURAG was specifically for my portfolio and potential scholarship... however is now public here. This release of DURAG and it's story are NOT considered canon, as it was a filler demo episode for technical review only. The game at it's core IS DURAG, but the real, canon, final release of DURAG will probably have more changes and definitely time put into it. The game (at it's base with no DLC installed) will have three episodes, which bounce from the main characters of Damani and Rocco. The main DURAG story line follows every episode where you play as Damani, and Rocco's episodes being the side-story, happening around the same time that Damani's episodes do... who knows... they may meet up one day...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:57:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e28/e281b0300727c3f4a9859f1360ff37a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Shaggy39"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
