The buttons on the instructions refer to the Xbox pad, so X isn't where you think it is. It's meant to be the bottom button to fire, left button for laser. Your button labels may vary, and the wrong button may inadvertently quit the game instead of starting. A little puzzle for you there, no charge.</p>\n<p>10 evenings work, submitted to BulletHellJam2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T17:14:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8b5e7502085ca3a1132cd80d6c1c0ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mugs Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
