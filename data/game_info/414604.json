Playing a game with the tapioca bubbles! Relax and enjoy until the tea is finished, but even then, there's always more bubble tea at the caf\u00e9!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the arrow keys to position the straw, then launch the bubbles with the spacebar. Three bubbles of the same color will disappear, and four or more of the same color will combine for a positive or negative effect!<br/></p>\n<p>Everything is made by me, PepperGhost. If there are any bugs, plz yell at me on twitter and I will try to fix them! (But a nice-like yell. Like a yodel? Yeah, that'd be nice.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T04:25:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/929/929b9d785d87507755dbfedd387de3a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PepperGhost"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
