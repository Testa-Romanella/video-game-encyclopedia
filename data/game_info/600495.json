The filter is composed of a core and a shield. As a player, you control the rotation of the filter in order to block damaging projectiles or to move your shield from the way of the good projectiles.\u00a0 As your score gets bigger the difficulty rises as well. The projectiles will be faster and will spawn at a faster rate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T11:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/648/64853fa73f8d681dc87297086675a5e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["paul.berta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
