Shatter as many terrible green asteroids as you can in this 80's inspired space shooter and track your high score. With momentum based movement these evil asteroids are more deadly than ever, but don't fear: There are a few power-ups along the way to help you out. Or potentially harm you. You can also team up with a fellow asteroid hater in local co-op. Or shove your friend into the asteroids if they don't hate asteroids as hard as you do. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n     TL;DR<br/>\r\n     -80's inspired space shooter<br/>\r\n     -Local co-op<br/>\r\n     -Controller support<br/>\r\n     -Endless high score shooter<br/>\r\n     -Momentum based movement<br/>\r\n     -80's synth soundtrack", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbd/dbd3d847e0b2cafb1de9cffcb81f7795.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Halcyon Day Digital Co"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Halcyon Day Digital Co"], "esrb_rating": null}
