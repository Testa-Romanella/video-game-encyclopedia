A classic style rpg which takes inspiration from SMT for apocalyptic and dark imagery. Navigate an underground laboratory in hopes that freedom may come with a chance to save humanity.<br/></p>\n<p>Content Warning: While this game does not contain any gore nor intense violence (nothing beyond what most rpgs feature), it does feature 4 child protagonists in a violent scenario. Were this game to become a full release, there would be a time skip in which they become older later on.<br/></p>\n<p>Though most of the visual assets are original, the music, sound effects, and battle animations are all part of rpg maker 2k3's included assets. I was also originally planning on adding at least 1 male character and 1 nonbinary character, but implementing the animations for the existing characters was already time consuming enough so I decided to hold off.<br/></p>\n<p>Please let me know if there are any issues which should be corrected.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T16:27:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38c63ba1915bfecaccbdf982989d1acf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrimsonBulb"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
