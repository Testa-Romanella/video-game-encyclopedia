All you can do in this game is run and shoot. The main target is to destroy the amoeba so it stops rapping in Russian.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nName of the game comes from the final words of the rap song which amoeba sings.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nHere is a review I got from a beta-tester:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\tIt is the only one who is not afraid to cross the line of what is permitted knows how far he can go\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tMinimalistic design hides the austerity of life of the author. As soon you start the game, it is absolutely clear \u2014 we are surrounded by an allusion of Eden, where the ball plays both the role of the Tempter and the Creator. A truly open, free world ends with a circle of green bushes.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tOf course, soon it becomes clear that the circle is for reason here \u2014 it is an obvious reference to the Ouroboros.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBut back to the story, which can be traced, once you seek the hidden meaning. What kind of amoeba is it that runs away from you? This amoeba beckons you, and at the same time tells to leave the game.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\"Ty iebanootyi!\" \u2014 it says to you rhythmically, alluding to the lack of logic and senselessness of what you do. But it is necessary to continue following the ball.\r\n\t<br/><br/>\r\n\tAnd at one point, it disappears.\r\n\t<br/><br/>\r\n\t\"Freedom!\" is the first thought that arises in the mind of yours, and now, finally, you can safely enjoy the Creation. But at the edge of you perception, you hear the words: \"Ty yebanootyy, ty yebanootyy!\", and you understand that the amoeba is not lost, it still calls you is a language only it understands.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t Running like a squirrel in a wheel around the scene, you finally manage to do the impossible \u2014 you go beyond. But once you accelerate, you fall into the abyss, which is the punishment for your excessive ambitions.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAfter closing the game, the player understands the leitmotif of this creation \u2014 it is the only one who is not afraid to cross the line of what is permitted knows how far he can go.\r\n\t<br/><br/>\r\n\tMinimalism, deep philosophy, and graphics making the powerful hardware lag .
