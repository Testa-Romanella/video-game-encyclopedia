Some guidance can be deceitful and corrupting. Some places are psychedelic, it playes with glitches, it's an orgasm of shaders and effects. \r\n<p>EXsynchronos is the final episode of the meloveyou trilogy. If you haven't played the first two EPs, then <strong>NO WORRIES... start with EXsynchronos</strong>.
