But for the GBA Jam, I programmed this version from scratch as it's <strong>100% made in Lua!</strong> Indeed, I used the wonderful <strong>BPCore-Engine by Evan Bowman</strong>  that allows to create a GBA games in Lua. If you ever used a fantasy  console like PICO-8 or TIC-80, it's a very similar tool, but the  resulting game will run on a actual console, our beloved Game Boy  Advance!\r\n </p>\n<p>If you want to try your hand at making GBA games, I really recommend  you BPCore-Engine: it's a real pleasure to make games with it. And I'm  also sharing the heavily commented code source of my game if it can  help you making your own GBA games in Lua: https://github.com/drludos/meteorain-gba</p>\r\nMusic credits\r\n<p>Ingame music: <strong>\"Overmode\" by Warlord</strong>, used under a CC-BY-NC-SA licence:\r\n http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/Overmode/7738/\r\n</p>\r\nLooking for a challenge?<p>My current record is 247 points.
