The original setup uses three traverses on the sides of which pressure pads are attached. Each player has one pressure pad to his or her right, one to the left and one on a low table to the front. For controlling the characters on the big screen in front of the players they use plastic pickaxes to hit the respective pressure pads (left, right, and the one in the front for downward movement).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T13:12:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea8/ea8bdf3a77a7aa4199cf0f6df5366f21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Meeple"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
