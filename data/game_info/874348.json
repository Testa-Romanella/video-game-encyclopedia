It is a vertical platforming game with core game mechanics revolving around climbing different types of ladders while scaling a tower. You will encounter enemies and obstacles along the way while also saving kittens that are trapped within the tower.</p>\n<p>You play as a brave and caring knight who has come to rescue their cat that has become a prisoner atop an evil cat wizard's tower. Within the tower, the cat's 20 kittens are also trapped in magical bubbles. It is the knight's duty to climb to the top of the tower and save their cat and her several kittens. The wizard will attempt to stop the knight by casting spells at them. The knight must beware of the wizard and their ghostly minions that patrol the tower.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>- Programming by Sean B. and Drewby</p>\n<p>- Source control by Max W.</p>\n<p>- Game design by Drewby</p>\n<p>- Music and sound effects by Drewby (2022)</p>\n<p>- Art and sprites by Drewby (2022)</p>\n<p>How to play</p>\n<p>Use left and right arrow keys to move, spacebar to jump, and up and down arrow keys to climb. When jumping from one ladder to another make sure to hold either up or down when jumping to grab onto the ladder. To save the kittens that are trapped in the bubbles, simply collide into them, this will raise your score. If you take damage, there are heart pickups that will heal. Within the main menu, there is an accessibility option menu, this includes cheats that you can toggle on or off. There are also different endings depending on whether you save all of your cat's kittens or not.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T13:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/846cc094545ebd0cf8b840f276154b4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["drewby"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
