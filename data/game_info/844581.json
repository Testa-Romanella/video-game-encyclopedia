As such, we're proud to deliver this demo at SAGE'22 Expo and hope you enjoy it as much as we do!\r\n<br/>\r\nIn this fast-paced action plataformer, you dwelve into Lost Angeles, a city plagued by supernatural parasytes called \"wisps\". Aside from looking suspiciously cute and marketable, wisps can possess human hosts and give them supernatural abilities in exchange of the person's free will. When a wisp gets bored enough, it breaks the connection to find a new host, leaving the current one behind with severe injuries in the process.\r\n<br/>\r\nIn order to protect the city, a governamental organization was created: P.C.E., which exists to Protect, Contain and Exterminate this threat and keep Lost Angeles at peace. <br/>But what happens when someone is unfortunate enough to be possessed by no mere wisp, but one megalomaniac enough to drag its host around in a rampage quest?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This year's demo presents the introductory section of the game (intro, tutorial and first level).\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T06:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab0cbc743b926c50e3116383c1cb6614.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Punk Puppy Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
