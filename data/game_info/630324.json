And which opportunities and insights can be gained by infiltrating them?\r\n<p>\u200d\r\n</p>\n<p>The workshop \u00abDigital Playforms\u00bb lets you explore a variety of digital platforms alongside three artists, that will guide you to playfully alienate the digital structures from their purposes. By implementing their own artistic approaches, Melody Chua, Laurent Jakimow and Quarck have created three very different artistic, fun and playful digital experiences in which the participants will be challenged to interact not only with the game but also with each other.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u200d\r\n</p>\r\nQUEERING GAMES\r\n<p>The workshop is part of the artistic research project\u00a0\u00abQueering Games\u00bb\u00a0which aims to find new forms of art and exhibition practices as well as calling their reception into question. Based on Queer Theory, playing serves us as a method to challenge social (game) rules.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nFUNDING\r\n<p>This workshop is realized within the framework of Queering Games with the kind support of Migros Kulturprozent. Kein Museum is supported by the Canton of Zurich (Department of Culture) and the City of Zurich (Department of Fine Arts).\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T16:50:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e1939dc1779ece81ea9d5d1c07e1b7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KEIN MUSEUM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
