Navigate flowerbeds, collect pollen and sell it at different hives to buy upgrades and become a very wealthy bee.

Weird level geometry - sometimes stuff spawns outside the bounds of the world. Not gamebreaking, just ugly.</p>\n<p>2. Game over is still a little janky.</p>\n<p>3. No real end game - progression is kind of pointless.</p>\n<p>4. Lots of inefficient and badly organized code -- this game was an exercise in actually _finishing_ a project, which meant prioritizing finished work over nice shiny code. </p>\n<p>As of November 28th, I'm out of time to work on this game jam, so this project is complete for the time being.</p>\n<p>This project is complete, so these issues will likely persist.</p>\n<p><strong> Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, Art - Evan Mulrooney - github.com/emulrooney</p>\n<p>SFX, Music - Erica Charles</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:36:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32a/32a0f5a187a4286b68ef123b8d49c8db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Evan Mulrooney"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
