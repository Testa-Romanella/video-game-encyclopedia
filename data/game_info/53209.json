It was released in North America on February 25, 2002 and in Europe on March 15, 2002.</p>\n<p>The Huge Adventure is the seventh installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series and the first Crash Bandicoot game to be released on a handheld console. The game acts as alternate sequel to the first four mainline games, and its story centers on a plot to shrink the Earth by the main antagonist, Doctor Neo Cortex, through the use of a gigantic weapon named the \"Planetary Minimizer\". The protagonist of the story, Crash Bandicoot, must gather Crystals in order to power a device that will return the Earth to its proper size, defeating Doctor Cortex and his minions along the way.</p>\n<p>The game stemmed from an agreement between Universal Interactive Studios and Konami that enabled them to produce and publish (respectively) a Crash Bandicoot game for next-generation handheld game systems, ending the franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles. Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure received generally favorable reviews from critics. The game was praised for its graphics and overall design, but critics noted the game's lack of innovation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-04T14:28:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f26/f26113f7e22d35ec89dcc32989d87733.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.76, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 10, "beaten": 20, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 20, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Vicarious Visions"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Vivendi Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
