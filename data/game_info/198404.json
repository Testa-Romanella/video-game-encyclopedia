He will break the law, take matters into his own hands to make this world a better place to live. Sneaking into the city, this man will dodge the police, and civilians to revive the city. The general public will not know his name, only his image, as he travels through different cities. He will redefine anarchism in his venture to take on the neglected responsibilities of his government.</p><p>This game was created for a class assignment with no intention to make money.
