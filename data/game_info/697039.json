You will <em>always</em> be learning something new.</p><p><strong>Please keep in mind that DeckMaster is in beta.</strong> I'm updating it constantly, but bugs are still to be expected. If you find anything, you can contact me anywhere and I'll try to get it fixed ASAP!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T09:53:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cef2f0352ab3e2044b6595775efc9ec9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuantumCatYT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
