The government feared the villagers telling the truth about what had happened,\u00a0so the town was closed forever, and no one ever visited the town, until you, a thrill seeker made it to the cursed land through many rumors. You must collect all the spirit and souls of those who died a unjust death and only then can you free them from the forever darkness, and welcome the sun. Beware of the mutated locals and evil entities that guard the bridge and the land of darkness.</p>\n\n<p>WASD and Space to move and jump</p>\n<p>Good luck explorer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T07:32:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c1/6c18a8a2f49dcc38275dc2ef1b974bb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BleepBloop"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
