The only thing that's giving you some sort of safety is a Campfire made out of sticks. You also got a stick as a weapon.<br/>What are you going to fight against? Monsters? Dangerous animals? Murderers?<br/>Nah, just sticks to be honest. Everything else would be too obvious.</p>\n<p>Hope you will enjoy my first game and will stick around for my upcoming projects!<br/></p>\n<p>Oh and please play it on 1920x1080! Otherwise it could be a bit trash ^^<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:35:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e3/6e3bdad7800850713f39e9932ef43548.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrZhiSponge18"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
