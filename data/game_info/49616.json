Or, perhaps you just like fun centers. If you answered yes to owning one but don\u2019t have millions of dollars to buy one, or answered yes to just liking to go to them but don't want to go out of your house, what is the next best thing (and cheapest option)? Having it in virtual reality! I couldn\u2019t find a game that fit my wants in a fun center type game so I created my own to share with the world!
