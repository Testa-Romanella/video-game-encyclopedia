If you get several in a row in the same spot, its bad RNG.<br/></p>\n\n<p>How the system works:</p>\n<p>Each character has Turn Units that count up to their Turn Unit max by their TU Speed. \u00a0When the character reaches their max, they become active in battle. \u00a0Meanwhile, while no characters are active, time flows normally and arrows move, fireballs move, traps activate, and roaming monsters roam, etc. \u00a0The idea is to have a realtime with turntime hybrid system, with characters being able to intercept arrows targeted at a squishy ally, and that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>Actual TU is spent in a combat action like so: First, the TU for each/any move is subtracted from the units current total. \u00a0Then, the remaining TU is either halved, thirded, or quartered, depending on the Move status (none, adjust, run).\u00a0 This is represented in the TU stat on the left in the status panel: as is, this is pretty confusing so I am looking into a way to make this work better. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Actual actions per round are currently limited to a single action.\u00a0 Multiple actions could be possible later, I am keeping things simple for now.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 <br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/846dd9da1d6073a935c5348f875ee91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ikkir"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
