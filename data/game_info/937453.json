The only way to do this is by jumping and reaching the fuse. But be careful, every jump comes with a risk of falling!<br/><br/>You'll need to plan your jumps carefully and predict where you'll land to avoid falling to your doom. While you're in the air, nothing can affect your character, so you'll need to pray that you land in the right spot.<br/><br/>The best route to the fuse may not always be visible, so keep your eyes sharp and look for clues that will help you navigate the obstacles in your way. And don't forget, every jump leaves a trace, so use that to your advantage and adapt your jump range accordingly.<br/><br/>With each level, the game becomes more challenging, requiring you to use all of your skills to make it to the end. Are you up for the challenge?
