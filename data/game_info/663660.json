This project is the continuation of a 7DRL-2021 submission.<br/></p>\r\nSummary\r\n<p>In this game, you build your character by gathering pieces of DNA.  You will be forming chromosomes by gathering one gene of each of the two  types:\r\n    </p>\n<ol><li>Trigger (greenish): determines when the chromosme is activated\r\n</li><li>Effect (blueish): determines what happens when the chromosome is activated\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>Those genes are teared of blops trying to kill you. Because they also  posess chromosomes which can be activated the same manners as yours!\r\n    </p>\n<p>The goal is to defeat enemies by anticipating the chains of effects, until you find The Blopulet. <br/></p>Disclaimer<p>The game is in development. It is playable and there is an end. But it is not really balanced.\u00a0</p>Controls\r\n<p>The controls are always displayed at the top of the screen.\r\n    </p>\n<p>They are updated when the mode changes.\r\n    </p>\r\nPrecisions and tips\r\n<ul><li>You attack when you move into an ennemy.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Damage dealt by attacking is equal to the attacker's power (displayed below the healthbar)\r\n</li><li>You regain all your life when you go downstairs.\r\n</li><li>Enemies drop <strong>only one</strong> gene when they die.\r\n</li><li>You can't remove genes from your DNA. But you can override them with other genes.\r\n</li><li>You can look at droped genes with Observation mode (Enter).\r\n</li><li>You can look at enemies' DNA and stats with Observation mode.\r\n</li><li>An incomplete chromosome does nothing.\r\n</li><li>There is no XP. You only get stronger by picking genes and items.\r\n</li><li><strong><em>The Blopulet</em></strong> is at depth 11.\r\n</li></ul>Goals of this project<ul><li>item-based progression, no exponential stats upgrades, no skill points</li><li>no grinding (no XP)</li><li>free-form builds, no classes, no skill trees </li><li>reward exploration of gene combinations</li><li>multiple viable but very different strategies</li><li>great replayability, interesting even in the first levels</li><li>short (&lt;1h)</li></ul><p>We are not here yet. For example there ARE better genes and trash genes, and the levels feel very samey.<br/></p>\r\nInspirations:\r\n<ul><li>Cogmind (and the devblog of its very kind author)</li><li>Brogue (I didn't play it, but I liked this talk)<br/>\n</li></ul>Credits\r\n<ul><li>Language: TypeScript\r\n</li><li>Library: rot.js\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Font: Fira Code</li><li>Developpers: Aur\u00e9lien Coussat and Maxime Chabance (Drestin)</li></ul>\r\nChangelog\r\n0.2 \r\n    \r\n<p>Lots of changes since the jam version. Mainly User Interface improvements, but there also are 9 new genes!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T08:44:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e0/2e0f1ba8807e5fa24b4d05dc2f33050d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Drestin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
