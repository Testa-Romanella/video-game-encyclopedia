Just as the title says, you will be stationed in a tower, where a chance roll of the dice will determine how long you have to win or lose. While the clock is ticking, you must stay cool under pressure and fight your way to the top of the tower by making calculated moves which involve taking on enemies equal or below your rank. One miscalculation, or the cruel fate of time, and it's Game Over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:39:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc5/bc58f606c32a496baa06ca89c3fd997d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ace Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
