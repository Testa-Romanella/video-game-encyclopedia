Your boss has given you an order to rob a specific item in each home, and you must do so without leaving any trace of your presence!</p>\n<p>Use the mouse controls to toss items around while you look for the item. Once you find it, click on it to collect it. Before you can leave the house, though, you have to make sure everything you moved is put back into their place! You don't want to get caught, after all.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversificadores Diversos:</strong></p>\n<p>Utilizamos o diversificador de \"Linguagens do Brasil\" - criando casas decoradas com itens caracter\u00edsticos do Rio Grande do Sul: cuia, bomba (o primeiro item a ser roubado pelo jogador \u00e9 uma bomba dourada), cacetinho (p\u00e3o franc\u00eas), churrasqueira, espetos, e muitas outras refer\u00eancias!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Developed by Diogo M\u00fcller and Julia Melgare.
