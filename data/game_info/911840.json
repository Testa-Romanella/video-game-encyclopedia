You won't have time to linger, though, as eventually the monster will appear and you must fight or flee into yet another dimension.</p>\n<p>This game is about a 20-30 minute experience, although each playthrough is unique in its own way.</p>\n<p>The game was developed by Frank Henry (Programming), Ginghis Ken (Sound), and Annie (Art).
