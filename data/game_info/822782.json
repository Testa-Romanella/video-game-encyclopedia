In the game you play as an explorer traversing an island, as you progress through the game you venture deeper into the island. The game features 4 playable worlds.</p>\n<p>The 4 worlds include:</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0Beach</li><li>\u00a0Forest</li><li>Mountain</li><li>Temple</li></ol>\n<p>Each with a unique design and tile set.</p>\n<p>Enemy birds will try to kill the player as they traverse through the game. They become more frequent as the game progresses. The goal is to reach the salt crystal at the end of each level. There are 12 currently playable levels.</p>\n<p><strong>SOME NOTES:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This was our first full game and game jam. Sorry for any bugs and the relatively short play time. We did intend to add some other features but ran out of time to add them in any meaningful way. If people actually play it and like it then we might update the game with more content.\u00a0Thanks for playing.</p>\n<p><strong>DEVS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A.Doge</p>\n<p>Sultry</p>\n<p>GenesisCookie</p>\n<p>Snoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T18:34:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2e/c2e7bfadf3b5b35eaca2d07048500af1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Angerydoge", "sultry", "genesiscookie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
