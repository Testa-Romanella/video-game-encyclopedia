Using funds from both agencies, he hired an old friend to track down 7 of the best and most skilled fighters in the Solar System, <em>after the disappearance of Earth's greatest hero</em>. This squad was formed to tackle the most severe threats to Earth's safety, including fighting off the notorious Cycloid race of aliens. However, they inadvertently set into motion a sequence of events that dramatically increase the scale of conflict, and they must soon deal with a threat that is new to even the most supernatural members of the team.<br/><br/>Can you fight as the AMC Squad, and take care of this threat? Will you scour the battlefield, find and acquire research and equipment and tackle the threat strategically, or simply run in guns blazing?

As Mikko, the cybernetic leader of MS Corp industries, who brings a range of deadly and hi-tech weaponry to the battlefield?\u00a0Or as Highwire, who relies only on his good old-fashioned military rifles, and a trusty bottle of Vodka?<br/><br/>Whomever you choose, be prepared for the fight of a lifetime.\r\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Classic FPS gameplay mixed with modern mechanics.</li><li>Mission-based level structure, spanning 3+ separate episodes, with more than 20 hours worth of content.</li><li>Intricate and highly interactive levels, with many secrets to find.</li><li>A rich story consisting of multiple character arcs and plot threads.</li><li>8 different character classes with different gameplay styles, with more to unlock as you progress.</li><li>Unique loadout of weapons and items for each character, as well as level-specific weapons to find and unlock.</li><li>Collectibles, weapon\u00a0replacements\u00a0and a fully-fledged loadout system.</li><li>Upgradeable weapons and character abilities.</li><li>Multiple vehicles, including motorcycles, spaceships, tanks and horses.</li><li>In-game cutscenes and pre-rendered FMV sequences, complete with\u00a0voice acting and subtitles.\u00a0</li><li>And more\u00a0features you never thought possible in a Build Engine game!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T08:02:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69b/69bbf2f0b24d6273fdf6cd2c61174759.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["AMCSquad"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
