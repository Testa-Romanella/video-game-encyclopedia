It will allow you to play 'Snap' on PICO-8!</p>\n<p>This game is two players only, so make sure you have somebody with you to challenge at this game. Player 1 uses Left to put a card on their side, while Player 2 uses Right to put a card on theirs. Once the cards are matching either Player 1 or 2 (depending on who's turn it is) presses the (O) key. After that, they win! However, if the cards don't match, both players will lose. So, make sure the cards match one another!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T12:24:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba4bc2fc98877130f5264b2dad6ef5e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PG24"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
