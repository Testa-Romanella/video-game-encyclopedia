You can control the robot's left and right movements and even when it jumps. The issue however is that you can only reliably send 4 seconds of movement data to the robot. Once it gets to the end it rewinds and starts again. This means that when moving you must take into account that your movements get repeated every 4 seconds.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>In recording mode:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A/D or Arrow Keys to record left or right movement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Z or space to jump</p>\n<p>When you've finished recording the four seconds of movement:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0R to reset the level</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0X to begin the robot's movement</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music: Electric Exodus v0.2 by FoxSynergy (https://opengameart.org/content/electric-exodus) (Slight modifications made to allow for looping)</p>\r\nPlatforms\r\n\r\n<p>Windows 7 or higher is required to run this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:59:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9db8e76f1498fcc6e177deb333d99f23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Watters"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
