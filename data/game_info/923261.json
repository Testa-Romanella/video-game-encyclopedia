Romeo is madly in love with a kitty named Julie but doesn't know how to impress her. Thus begins his quest...</p>\n\n<p>The player helps Romeo navigate a sunset paradise, collecting roses while fighting rival cats, naughty cupids and other enemies. Will Romeo win Julie's affection? How many secrets will he discover along the way?</p>\n<p>Romeo's Purrfect Adventure features one fully playable level. I plan to add more levels in the future and possibly combine this and other event-themed cat games into an anthology.
