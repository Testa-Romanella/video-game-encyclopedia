There are ten levels to smash through\u00a0with randomized elements for replayability.\u00a0The fall edition features a spectacular soundtrack and spooky handcrafted pixel art inspired by the autumn season.</p>\n<p>You control the ghost of a soul doomed with the task of breaking every single cursed brick that was placed by the corrupted generations that came before. With a jack o' lantern as your vessel, you are able to shift the platform using ethereal magic and shatter these cursed bricks with four orbs. If successful, you will finally be liberated from the curses and find hope in the possibility of a less grim tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Download the free demo today to play the fifth level and experience a portion of the darksynth / metal soundtrack!</p>\n\n<p><strong>C O N T R O L S</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys\u00a0= Movement</p>\n<p>Spacebar = Begin</p>\n<p>R\u00a0= Restart Level</p>\n<p>Escape = Quit</p>\n\n<p><strong>C R E D I T S</strong></p>\n<p>Created by\u00a0VOMITINGMOOSE for the\u00a0Crunchless Challenge</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio</p>\n<p>Created with\u00a0GameMaker Studio 2 and\u00a0Audacity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:57:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d228e99a254918dc194508580fb5284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VOMITINGMOOSE"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
