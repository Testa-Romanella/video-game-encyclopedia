It is on\u00a0to please the gods by providing them a full set of runes \u2013 for eternity. The gods are impatient though. Should you not be quick enough providing them the sets they may send you to afterlife.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>How to play:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Four different runes are assigned to the d-pad of the playdate. In front of you you find a collection 8 runes. One of the original four is missing.\u00a0</li><li>Select this rune on the d-pad and you are rewarded with points. Be careful. Every wrong selection will deduct points.\u00a0</li><li>You are playing against time so hurry up.</li><li>You can create a streak that will give you time back for each five full sets in a row \u2013 they even will provide you extra points. The game is over if the patience of the gods is not with you anymore... as in time is up.</li><li>You may restart always as the gods forget about you quickly.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Don't play on maximum volume. The sounds are a bit broken.</strong></p>\n<p>This game was done as part of a play jam.</p>\n<p>This is my first time coding something like this. I used only pulp by panic for this and got quite far in the last two days.</p>\n<p>I recently found a bug where sometimes two runes seem to be missing yet that seems to happen rarely.</p>\n<p>Please don't pay for this game but donate to a good cause if you were actually considering putting money into this. It is a fun experiment and actually a quite addicting game for what it is, but maybe in the future I make it a real game.</p>\n<p><strong>Please give it a try and let me know if you enjoyed the game mechanics! :)</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T12:30:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d2c2b28a2393c348e0a5ff7840a559f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rantdom"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
