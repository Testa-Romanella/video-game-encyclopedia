{"id": 195233, "slug": "chaos-arena", "name": "Chaos Arena", "name_original": "Chaos Arena", "description": "<p>Chaos Arena is an arena-survival action game where you utilize a sword and magic to defeat your foes.</p>\n<p>You move with WASD, and you can disappear in a cloud of smoke to dodge foes' attacks by pressing the space bar. You swing your sword to hack through hordes of enemies and recharge mana with the left mouse-button. You can switch between 4 different spells with the 1-4 keys, and cast spells by clicking the right mouse-button, or hold to charge for more powerful spells. Enemies have a small chance of dropping health pick-ups upon death. Enemies gradually spawn faster the longer you survive. There are only two types of enemies, but they come in different sizes, with larger enemies having more health.</p>\n<p>Chaos Arena is the first game developed by Weston Mansfield and Cody Selman. We completed it in about two weeks on GameMaker Studio 2. The goal of this game was to make a game, start-to-finish, to see if it was something we liked doing. Weston primarily handled the art and visual design, while Cody handled most of the programming. Our friend Jeff Alvarez was kind enough to whip up all of the audio for the project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ece/ecee3c57fa5572b0b9a4af7d28caaf0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cody Selman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
