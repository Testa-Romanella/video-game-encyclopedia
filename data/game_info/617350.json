Hostages are small green robots, they are almost out of power and cannot navigate their surroundings. Your goal is to get in their line of sight\u00a0so that they receive a signal and start following you. To escape the room you need to find all green robots and lead them to the exit without getting caught by red robots. Red robots can see you with their cameras, but you can trick them by hiding behind the walls. If red robots catch you or any of the hostages you'll have to try again.</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n  </p>\n<p>wasd - movement;\r\n  </p>\n<p>p - pause.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Music by: https://freesound.org/people/samueloak89/\r\n  </p>\n<p>Art by: _mirthless_ (Instagram)</p>\n<p>Made for GMTK GameJam 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:13:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/148ce73fa4149ad4f88a3827bcc1c213.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sergeyrid"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
