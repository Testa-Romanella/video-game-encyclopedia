Each time you jump, the level fades a little bit more into the abyss. Rethink the way you maneuver in a traditional platformer, and challenge your idea of what's possible\u00a0with less.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0originally made this game as a final project for a college course, and I'm continuing development in my own time. As of now, it features a small number of levels which demonstrate only a portion of what is possible with the core mechanic; more puzzles will come in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Negative Space</em> is made almost entirely by me, Andrew Knollmeyer, with some sound assets sourced from the internet. In the process of developing this game, I have gained skill in and familiarity with programming, animations, UI design, level design, iterative design, playtesting, and more. From the initial paper prototypes I made with transparent projector sheets to the fully digital product it is now, I have learned so much about planning, documenting, and building on player feedback. I plan to continue building levels for the game until I have constructed a cohesive puzzle experience which could last a couple hours\u00a0for an average player.<br/></p>\n<p>If you enjoy the game, be sure to share it with your friends, or just leave some constructive feedback here in the comments. Any help goes a long way and is super appreciated :)</p>\n<p><em>Credits</em></p>\n<ul><li>Andrew Knollmeyer - Designer, Programmer, Artist</li><li>Music: \"Up in the Sky\" - Memoraphile @ You're Perfect Studio</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:54:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/584/584d3869d3201d5755fee05a9b69692d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["fshh - Andrew Knollmeyer"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
