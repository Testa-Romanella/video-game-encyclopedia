The true meaning of the game is that no amount of material goods can be worth more than a place to call home. Without a place to call home, one loses part of themselves, part of them will always be missing, searching for safety and\u00a0security. This goes for all other simple necessities of life. It doesn't take much to lose part of your identity that nothing other than that missing part can fill, but the smallest things make the biggest impact.</p>\n<p>Also, the art style is really simple, so there's that too I guess.</p><p><strong>P.S -\u00a0</strong>Sorry for the terrible noise after you beat the boss, I don't know what's wrong with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:39:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b10/b10ffa36b8a0372f591f76bfb820a78c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JHawk Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
