The music is by Kevin MacLeod and most of the art is from Kenney asset packs. The sound effects come from various sound packs I have purchased over the years.</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>Defend your castle from monsters by typing their word to kill them. Earn points for killing enemies, but beware! Accuracy matters! Each time you type an incorrect letter the game will speed up. Survive for as long as you can!</p>\r\nTools\r\n<p>Godot (C#), Visual Studio Code<br/>Aseprite</p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>Because I had only 3 hours to put this game together, it might not be balanced. The early game might feel too easy, and the difficulty might scale too quickly. I didn't have enough time to give it a proper balance pass.</p>\n<p>But in the end I think\u00a0I'm very happy with the result, considering that it was my first attempt at Trijam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T08:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27f/27fbb0515dc3772d7a9015e4fbf5392d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Justin C"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
