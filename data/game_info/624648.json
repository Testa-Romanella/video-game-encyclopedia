The challenge was to create a game in under 560 characters (or two tweets).</p>\n<p>\u00a0In the game, you play as a brave rabbit guarding your carrot patches against evil alien invaders. Click the mouse to fire your carrot cannon at the alien's probes before they destroy\u00a0 all of your patches. If they're all gone, you won't have any more carrots to fire and the alien wins!</p>\n<p>It is based on a game my friend and I made years ago in high school. The original was called Toon Attack.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecd834c59860e498bfa9c779a52d5163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thavelick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
