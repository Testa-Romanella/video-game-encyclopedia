The mission is to fly over the suspected nuclear missile silo bases and take photographs while avoiding the missiles that are targeting you every second.</p>\n<p>Make sure you look at the fuel gauge, as you need to keep enough fuel to finish the mission. The mission will span over 3 areas, and a total of 6 photographs are required for completion.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Good luck out there!</p>\r\nControls\r\n\n<strong>W</strong>Throttle <em>( Consumes more fuel)</em><strong>A &amp; D</strong>Steer Left and Right\r\n\r\nNote from the Developer\r\n<p>Unfortunately, due to the time constraints, I was unable to add sound and music to the game, but I am working on it and will add it to the next update.
