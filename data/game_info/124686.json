It's happening again this October, and we want you to submit a paper, a demo or a tutorial about something cool you've done, written about or thought about. Indies, artists and other non-academics are also very welcome!</p><p>You can find out more about us online at www.exag.org. We try to be a different kind of academic event, and one of the sillier ways we do this is to make little games to advertise our workshop. This year it's a parody of BurgerTime - make papers by walking over section headers to line them all up and submit them to EXAG.</p><p>If you don't fancy downloading it, <strong>you can play the game online by clicking here!</strong></p><p>If you have any questions, you can ask us on Twitter - @zookae, @sentientdesigns and @mtrc. &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52a/52ab0eb74592a7c416aadc5f758918f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Cut Garnet Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
