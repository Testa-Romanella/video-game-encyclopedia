The theme for the jam was, \"genre without mechanic\".</p>\n<p> Our game, \"Revolt\", is a match-3 game where the player avoids making sets of three. You play as an advisor to a dictator who is trying to arrange his population according to a specific plan. Citizens can be moved in the traditional match-3 fashion of switching places. However, lines of three or more matching citizens will begin to generate unrest. If too much unrest is generated before the population is arranged correctly, there will be a revolt, and the player loses.</p>\n<p> <br/></p>\n<p>Licenses for Assets Used:<br/></p>\n<p>DawnLike 16x16 Universal Rogue-Like TileSet, by DragonDePlatino.
