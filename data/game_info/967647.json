Alfredo Garcia is an ordinary man who lives in the countryside.<br/>\r\nLike most men, he ran out of the house. With his lovely lover Janet.<br/>\r\nThree months later, he was in great trouble. I'm going home now. I don't know why, but the way home doesn't look as easy as before. Can you take him home?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nProduction of a behind-the-scenes story that never got noticed! Play \"Roll Me Home\" right now. If your beard is growing, I recommend you play it<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRoll the character with the rudder and jump. As usual, it's a space bar<br/>\r\nIt has simple manipulation, but it's not going to be an easy challenge<br/>\r\nUnderstand the physics of things and explore the silhouette.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game includes difficulty and gore images, but that's not all. I hope you will read Garcia's letter and want to send him home.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-13T04:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f0/9f0e879346fe87b07442dcd1ac6415cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PUMPKIM"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PUMPKIM"], "esrb_rating": null}
