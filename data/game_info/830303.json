It happens to the best of us. You don't need to worry, though- here at the Hotel Ouroboros, not only are you given new life, but you'll be able to live it in the absolute lap of luxury. Enjoy our state of the art pool, our decadent menu, and all the accommodations that you can ask for: completely free of charge!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Kick back, unwind, and let us treat you. After all, time's ticking.</em></p>\n<p><em>With love,</em></p>\n<p><em>The Management.\"</em></p>\n<p>You play as Wren, a young woman who has found herself on the wrong end of a car bumper, and woken up, miraculously alive and well, in a strange hotel isolated from the world. By turning the many clocks throughout the hotel, she can alter the flow of time, saving her from the trouble of waiting around and twiddling her thumbs for things to happen.</p>\n<p>Get to know other guests who have been lost to the ages, and learn their stories. Figure out why you've been brought back to life. Die. Again.</p>\n<p>And please, don't feed the rats. They're getting to be a real issue these days, and it's so difficult to get a decent exterminator around here.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard and Mouse are both supported.<br/>Z-\u00a0Interact<br/>Arrow Keys -\u00a0Move</p>\n\n\n<p>Please Note: The game was completed in a bit of a pinch and is VERY buggy in its current state.
