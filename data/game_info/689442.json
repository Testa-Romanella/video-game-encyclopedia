Please play this game at fullscreen<br/></p>\n<p>This is a game I created for my final year project in my bachelor's degree programme.\u00a0 My project is titled Gamification of Cybersecurity Awareness Training. This game was created as a fun interactive approach to raise people's awareness and knowledge about cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>The major concept of this game is cybersecurity, and it has two stages. This concept was chosen to satisfy the project's objective of creating a game that would educate people about cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>The first stage includes an escape room where players must solve three puzzles based on clues and hints found around the scene. The hints are all clickable and have something to do with cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>The explanations for the stage 1 riddles are included in stage 1.5. Right after stage 1. Feel free to immerse yourself in each riddle's explanation.<br/></p>\n<p>The second stage is a quiz stage, in which the players must complete all quizzes in order to escape. This stage contains three cybersecurity-related topic quizzes, each with ten questions. Players can also view notes and hints before answering questions and retake it as many times as they want, however each quiz must be completed within 5 minutes and players will only have three hearts.</p>\n<p>This game will be played in the browser, so there will be no need to download anything. Feel free to give it a try, and if you have time, please fill out the pre-play and post-play questionnaires as feedback. I definitely appreciate your time. <br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>//The questionaire is still in progress. feels free to comment instead.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T07:27:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b876ed75c71877ef3cdb39d643a67a06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rikuo_otonashi"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
