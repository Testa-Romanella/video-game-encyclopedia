It's only a small game and it doesn't have much depth, but there's an idea being explored that you might find fun! Here's how it works:</p><ul><li>Use the arrow keys to move all your adventurers at once.</li><li>Skeletons hunt down things they can see (in straight lines only).</li><li>Skeletons attack things standing next to them.</li><li>Each level is complete when all <strong>living</strong> adventurers are on exit tiles.</li></ul><p>I hope you enjoy it! Let me know what you think, particularly if you have any comments about the puzzle design. You can leave comments here, or send me a tweet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2c214fae47e80105b2729d2efc4cc6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Cut Garnet Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
