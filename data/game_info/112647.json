(Ludum Dare #33)</strong><br/><br/>------------------------------------- <br/><br/><strong>You're a growing monster baby. You need to eat to survive. You also need to hide from the damn humans to survive. Your cover also happens to be your food. Uh-oh! </strong></p>\n<p>As a newly hatched Magicrap, floundering about, minding your own business, working damn hard just not to starve to death and scraping up just enough money for your family to get by, it's absolutely insult to injury when some capped kids stomps into your personal space, and starts throwing these bloody things at you. <br/><br/>Looks like you gotta keep your wits about you to outsmart these abominable kids! Who the hell do they think they are?? <br/><br/>------------------------------------- <br/><br/>*So* many features that I wanted to include but didn't make it in. But despite that it's all actually pretty fun! What I did manage to squeeze in: </p>\n<p>&gt; Stealth system where you have to eat your cover to stay alive. <br/>&gt; 5 Levels. <br/>&gt; You can 3 star each level by completing them \"perfectly\". <br/>&gt; Audio! (Making time for sound is among the best decisions you can make for a jam game) <br/>&gt; Not nearly as many bugs as I thought there'd be! <br/>&gt; A beginning and an end!
