{"id": 798410, "slug": "the-manfisher", "name": "The ManFisher", "name_original": "The ManFisher", "description": "Christian adventure with spiritual quest\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Play as Johnas who is called by God to go to seven cities and deliver letters to seven churches. While you are sojourning on the island Petra (The Rock) you need to survive and overcome the tribulations and sufferings in faith. Interact with the people by having conversations and if possible share the Gospel with them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On your journey it is of\u00a0great importance to maintain your walk with Christ. The indicators of your spiritual health are \"faith\" and \"good works\". Prayer and reading the Bible are examples of ways to increase your faith. The scriptures are accessible at all times and the whole\u00a0audible Bible can be read out loud for you, while you keep on exploring the island. Besides the narrative\u00a0are the side quests such as finding collectables, helping people out and learning the deeper truths of God's word.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nThe development\r\n<p>Up to this point is The ManFisher\u00a0being developed by one man. The current version of The Man Fisher is an alpha release, which means that it is still in development and not finished yet. The 4km\u00b2 open world is already much developed and fully accessible (seven cities, forests, fields, mountains, beaches etc.) . The game-play and interaction with the people of the island is currently limited to one city. Twelve music tracks have already been composed and more will come if this game is being developed further.<br/></p>\n\r\nNot of the world\r\n<p>The ManFisher is not intended to be played by children. Subjects like various sins, violence , blood and death may not be suitable for a young age. Discretion is therefore needed. This game <strong>however</strong>, will <strong>not</strong> lead the player into sin, nor reward them (as with most of the games on the market), but in fact, the player is rewarded for resisting sin instead. Violent behavior, theft etc. will lead eventually to a \"game over\". It is by far a worldly game and if you are specifically looking for one, then this is certainly not for you. The ManFisher will try to lead you to a godly behavior, which is simply the opposite of that of the\u00a0world and its games.<br/></p>\n\r\nThe Word\r\n<p>The great care for God's word, its interpretation and implementation makes the Man Fisher partly an interactive Bible study. The focus will always be mainly on the Gospel, the Cross and salvation through Jesus Christ alone. All scripture is regarded as the word of God, so in the ManFisher both the Old and the New Testament are used to create the narrative and gameplay. As you play this game you're expected to study and understand the meaning of things that are brought to you in various ways.<br/></p>\n\r\nVintage style PC game\r\n<p>The graphics look a kind of\u00a0\"vintage\" and the majority is made in-house, just like the rest of the content. This is not a game made with Unity or Unreal\u2122 nor with content of their asset stores. It currently runs in a custom fork of an infamous fully open sourced game engine called Torque. It\u2019s not bound by 3rd party licenses that may limit the distribution or require royalties. Controls and mechanics have much similarities with those open world games from 10 years ago.</p>\n\r\nHow much you can play already...\r\n<p>The alpha release is to be considered as a demo version. You can start playing right now and while the content and narrative for each of the seven cities is being developed further with the releases being offered as patches. The finishing of the game really depends on the financial support it receives. As I am writing this now (May  2022) the income is not even enough to pay for a Photoshop\u2122 subscription.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nTech\r\nMinimum requirements:\r\n<p>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 7 (SP1) 64bit\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i3-3225 or AMD Phenom II X6 1100T\r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: Nvidia GTX 650 Ti or AMD HD 7850\r\nStorage: 5 GB available space\r\nPeripherals: Mouse &amp; keyboard\r\nDisplay: 720p is the bare minimum / 1080p recommended\r\n\u00a0<br/>Performance:\u00a0\r\n<p>The current build is not optimized yet. Though it\u2019s a 32-bit application, due to it\u2019s current memory load (around 3.5 GB) can it only run on a 64-bit operating system at this time. The initial aim to release this on 32-bit seems no longer doable, so if the development continues it\u2019s likely that it\u2019s going to be a 64-bit release only. It\u2019s a CPU hungry game, and runs best with high clock speeds. It\u2019s recommended to set the power profiles of laptops to \u201cperformance\u201d and boost the CPU (overclocking etc.) to gain more fps. 4Ghz or higher may give you around (roughly!) 50fps on a lot of areas on the map, but also may still drop to 30fps in dense areas; that is on 1080p. Playing on 2k (or more) -may- cause instability, depending on the other graphics settings and the hardware.<br/><br/><strong>\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f </strong><strong>alpha build 0.1.7 runs best at 1080p\u00a0with medium settings!!!</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em> \u00a0\u00a0(1920 x 1080 pixels)</em></p>\r\nNote\r\n<p>Please read this:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\r\nBuy the ManFisher if you have no issues playing a game that is not finished yet, may see some poor performance, instabilities and overall lower quality than the current industry standard.
