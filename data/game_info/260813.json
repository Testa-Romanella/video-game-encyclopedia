There are even more activities to discover beyond the gates of the Mascherata. You have been invited to carouse among peerage and poverty, \u00a0pundits and pariahs, merchants and mendicants. Who are you to them? Who are they to you?</p>\n<p>No one, that's who. Once you have donned the mask, it will make you anew -- and it will not come off so easily.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Night of Nights</strong> is a carnivalesque text-based exploration game featuring directional navigation, an inventory system, NPCs, multiple endings, and 13000+ words overall. Though the game takes inspiration from some Italian Carnevale traditions, the setting itself is a fictional pastiche that in no way reflects real life, geography, or epidemiology.</em><em>Made for <strong>ECTOCOMP 2018</strong> (Le Grand Guignol).</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f88/f8801abb28a672606d06bc108fe465a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grim \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
