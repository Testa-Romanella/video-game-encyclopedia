Twitch reactions won\u2019t be enough to carry you through, you\u2019ll need to think strategically and plan your next move to stay alive. Intense. Demanding. Exhilarating.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDid we mention hard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat our playtesters are saying...<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cJust played for a solid hour, I already love this game. Probably tied for my #1 favorite. Such a blast.\u201d<br/>\r\n-- La Casa De Huevos, Playtester<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cThe swinging mechanics are incredibly well designed. Feels exhilarating. The aesthetic is delightfully clean and vibrant.\u201d<br/>\r\n-- Luny, Playtester<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cI personally love it. I found the grappling to be incredibly fluid and easy to pick up. It felt like Spider-Man meets Galaga.\u201d<br/>\r\n--  iHi, Playtester<br/>\n<br/>\r\nComing Summer 2021", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T03:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/389/389ebbe3e49eb5c7900f3bd9e19af6f8.jpg", "website": "https://www.swarmvrgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greensky games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Greensky games"], "esrb_rating": null}
