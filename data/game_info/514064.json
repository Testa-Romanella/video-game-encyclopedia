Hunger and the undead are dangerous - especially at night - but you also have to manage the social structure of the survivor group to avoid conflicts and\u00a0keep everyone happy. Every survivor is not just a unit but a character with indiviual looks, skills, tastes, needs, wishes and interests, and of course these interests may be in conflict.</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n<p><strong>!!  WORK IN PROGRESS\u00a0 !!</strong></p>\n<p>This is a <strong>very early version</strong> of the game and a lot of features are not implemented yet. For now it's mainly the basic structure for a game like this to run. There is no sound yet, some GUI elements are only decorative by now and there may be some minor bugs left. But still this prototype shows what kind of game this is planned to become.</p>\n<p>Features so far:</p>\n<ul><li>explore an island</li><li>fight zombies</li><li>loot weapons and food</li><li>put up tents</li><li>survive as long as you can</li></ul>\n<p>I work a lot with random generators, therefore the entire map\u00a0as well as the houses and the characters are generated randomly. This game is planned as a <strong>sandbox / </strong><strong>simulation </strong>game and will probably not have a story line. But the goal is to create a complex simulation of the given scenario that creates a story of its own.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm planning to work on this project for the next months and a whole lot of features have yet to be implemented (tutorial, random map generator, social system, happiness system, aging, seasons, crafting, buildings, farming, cars, etc.).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls are listed under Menu (Esc) -&gt; Options.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>For now this is it. Any feedback and/or bug reports are highly appreciated :-)<br/>-&gt; jschoenergames@gmail.com<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:01:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d23/d237920e40f7f27ee89faad581668f77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jschoener"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
