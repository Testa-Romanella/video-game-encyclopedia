It has minor horror elements as well as basic puzzle mechanics, so make of that what you will.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as John, a young man who's started having trouble with anxiety after a traumatic experience. The game is focused on you navigating your apartment as more and more fears pop up to make life more difficult. My approach to the theme of the jam \"Out of control\", is to relate it to my personal struggle with anxiety and OCD, and has little mechanical presence in the game. This could of cource be something to critique, but know that I am well aware of the possibly lacking mechanics.<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94b222d48213055ff3ead398b91f2eef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["That`s Boring"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
