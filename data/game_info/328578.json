(Alpha)", "description": "<p>ROCK PAPER SCISSORS FIGHT is a 2D\u00a0platform fighter that puts a twist on the classic game of rock, paper, scissors. Players can switch between the three to\u00a0try and strike with a weapon that beats their opponent's. But choose wisely, as you'll be locked in to your weapon for a brief period of time after switching, leading to a constantly shifting match dynamic!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Supports local multiplayer with 2-4 players. Compatible with most modern controllers (but let me know if yours doesn't work!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T04:56:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4c/e4c1b5a0ff39b9727a293460f4b4e9ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["brenanwayland"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
