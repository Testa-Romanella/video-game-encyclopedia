We want\u00a0to create this game to reflect on how people obsess with posting on social media and seeing others' reaction on their posts. We\u00a0want to send out the message that we should embrace our imperfections in reality and prevent deceiving ourselves by others' judgements on social media.</p>\n<p>Try to get enough likes on social media platform and avoid hates and bad feedbacks to get through levels. In the last level, likes of the post will become the energy of the big boss which is the imagined and unreal-self on social media. You have to beat the big boss to get back to the reality.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Press\u00a0\u00a0\u2191\u00a0 \u00a0\u2190\u00a0 \u2192\u00a0\u00a0to move, space to jump, and right shift to fire.
