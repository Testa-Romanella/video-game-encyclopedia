It seems to be fine in fullscreen, however.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>This morning you woke up dead. It's unfortunate, but it happens to us all and quite frankly it'd be easier on everyone if you'd just stop moaning about it and get on with your afterlife.<br/></p>\n<p>Speaking of which, we have a job for you...</p>\n<p><strong>Rescue Fellow Ghosts</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Some wannabe Ghostbuster is going around trapping ghosts. As a card-carrying member of the afterlife, you are tasked with setting them free. There's just one problem; ghosts can't see the living world.</p>\n<p>If you are to save your undead brethren and avoid falling into the same fate yourself, you need to borrow the eyes of the living. Don't worry, they won't even know you're there.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The controls in Free The Ghost! are very simple. Use your WASD keys or gamepad controller to float around, and your space bar or A button to jump into a living body for a glimpse of the living world.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Does This Exist?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Free The Ghost! was made in 10 days for Seth Funk's Frightfully Funky Jam 2022. The theme was \"Thru the eye\" and there was also a restriction that the game must support a game controller. Unfortunately, due to work constraints, I didn't get time to add as much content as I'd have liked, but the game mechanics are fully fleshed out.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to see more content from me, check out my YouTube channel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T09:41:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad5/ad5e740702b8a7f05494735c53b9c43a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["b3agz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
