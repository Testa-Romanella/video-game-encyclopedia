{"id": 613364, "slug": "paradise-fishing", "name": "Paradise Fishing", "name_original": "Paradise Fishing", "description": "<p>A few years ago I was part of a team that ran a FiveM server called Swedish Paradise. We had a lot of fun doing that, and we had a small group of enthusiastic players.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons we had so much fun is because we had quite a few entirely custom made mini games. The most popular of these was the fishing. It has been sorely missed, so I decided to re-implement it as a stand-alone game.</p>\n<p>Implemented in the Godot engine, I present to you: \u00a0Paradise Fishing</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong><br/>This is pretty much all placeholder graphics and there is a real chance I'll even be swapping out the sound effects. It is my understanding of the license of the things used that I'm allowed to use them in this way (sound effects, font, etc), but should I discover that I've overstepped I will <em>of course</em> remove it immediately. If you own these assets, just let me know if you want them yoinked, and they are as good as gone.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T11:58:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c74/c7441efe8e0d8d4e7a61f6272067b221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Demonen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
