All he wants to do is reach the end of the level but keeps falling off! Perhaps he could do it if a kind person in front of a screen could help him in some way?</p>\n<p>Reach the end by changing shape to solve various physics-based puzzle\u00a0platforming maneuvers! Dynamically switch characters\u00a0as either a squishy cube with wall running and sliding mechanics or a hard bouncy ball to achieve\u00a0massive movement potential by chaining movements together! Can you reach the end?</p>\n<p>Developed in the Game Design III course, at the University of the Witwaterstrand.</p><p>Feel free to donate to my Paypal at\u00a0paypal.me/DarthMurky\u00a0to support me in my studies\u00a0:) Have a great day ^^<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T05:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e1a6b10a4084386d106e65e3781fd19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["DarthMurky"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
