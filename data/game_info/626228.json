Remain hidden for as long as you can. Once you're detected though then the hunt can only end one way, with your death. You can try and buy time by running or screaming. But in the end the Whispers will always find you.</p>\n<p>You can play in <strong>offline</strong> or <strong>online</strong> mode. <strong>In online mode</strong> the paths that other players have taken will make those same areas of your world more dangerous. In both modes you can customise many of the balance options and easily share yours with others using the 'balance code'.</p>\r\nPhotosensitivity Warning\r\n<p>This game contains both moving and flashing lights. It may cause discomfort and/or trigger seizures for people who have photosensitive epilepsy even if you have no prior history of epilepsy or seizures.</p>\n<p>Some effects can be turned off in the Settings menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:18:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76ae21117fe60b35f253aed5b5f66549.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
