Develop your skills in combat to earn money and experience. Money will purchase more blocks to expand your castle. Experience levels you up, opening up new block types and other building opportunities. A higher level also earns you more fame, which indicates how many blocks and items you can use to build your castle. The more fame you have, the bigger and more elegant a castle you can build. Every piece has a specific use: ballistas for defence, beds for soldiers, and plants and art to improve the morality of the castle\u2019s occupants. As the castle\u2019s king, it\u2019s your duty to provide the perfect balance of defence, occupancy, and morality. From this, what will begin as a small keep will evolve into a sprawling fortification with towers, steeples, and secrets. <br/><ul><li>Build your very own castle with no limit but your imagination and prestige <br/></li><li>Build a castle from scratch or choose from prebuilt castles that you can modify or defend <br/></li><li>Build according to realistic defence and physics<br/></li><li>Use extensive terraforming to improve environmental defence or aesthetics of the castle <br/></li><li>Tiny details to improve the look or functionality  of the castle<br/></li><li>Realistic physics: if you knock out the base of a tower, the entire structure will fall<br/></li><li>Choose from over 200 block types <br/></li><li>Customize your own flag<br/></li><li>Customize your marshal and army loadout for defence and for offence</li></ul>Combat<br/>When fighting other players, the game\u2019s balancing system ensures you and your opponent have similar levels, prestige, and fame. As the siege commences, the attacker deploys their marshals to the field while the defender sets up their marshals inside the castles at appropriate defence sites. As an attacker, take advantage of trebuchets and other siege equipment. As a defender, utilize your battlements and other historically accurate defence techniques. Command your marshals in battle or take first person control and engage in the fight yourself. As an attacker, eliminate the defending army or take the throne within a given time limit to win. As a defender, ensure you survive the time limit or kill off all the attackers. Battles are not just one-on-one: invite friends to help defend your castle too.<br/> <ul><li>First person and top down combat depending on how you want to fight<br/></li><li>Destruction of the castle is not permanent. Damage automatically repairs after combat <br/></li><li>Dying in battle happens.

Some will teach players about intricate game mechanics and others will be inspired by true historical events. Campaign victories reward players with useful blocks, units, items, and other relics to improve their own castle. From the beginning, new players will have access to the tutorial campaign and one or two additional campaigns.<br/> <ul><li>Adds engaging story elements to the game<br/></li><li>Campaigns will be regularly updated, hopefully two new ones per year<br/></li><li>Campaigns offer unique rewards for your castle to show off your achievements <br/></li><li>Campaigns will consist of 4-7 missions</li></ul>DevelopmentThis game is still in development.
