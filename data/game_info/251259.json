Puzzlescript is an engine designed by Stephen Lavelle.\u00a0The first game was already ported to Puzzlescript by Anna Anthropy:</p>\n<p>https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=a0e0b94c91f3fe029c89<br/></p>\n<p>And she used that port as a basis for her lovely little game, Aunt Flora's Mansion:</p>\n<p>https://w.itch.io/aunt-floras-mansion<br/></p>\n<p>I've always enjoyed Cyberbox 2, though it is quite a bit more complex than the first one. So I thought I'd port it to Puzzlescript as well! This game is quite special to me, as it's the very first sokoban-style puzzle game I've ever played in my life. Child me was perplexed and intrigued by the game's level editor and I made quite a few!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coming back to Cyberbox 2 like this is\u00a0a nice way for me to celebrate 5 years of Puzzlescript and 10 years of Increpare's inspiring works!</p>\n<p>Everything is included here, even the grass. You can copy and paste custom Cyberbox 2\u00a0levels into the source code\u00a0and they will play!\u00a0</p><p>https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=22b495b87251d63782b22daa3235e0c4<br/></p>\n<p>(When you bring in a level, be sure to put a 'zy' in the top-left corner.)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c554d27fe672a86c848a7cf11e1c4aa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aquin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
