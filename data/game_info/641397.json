Strangely, \"gnoblins\" in hot air balloons show up to sabotage the operation! They covered the innocent birds with tar and they're throwing heavy debris on your island to weigh you down!</p>\n<p>With your water gun, clean the birds and they'll help lift your island up, push debris off of your island and douse the fires in the gnoblins' hot air balloons to make sure your weight doesn't become too high!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the StarEye Atlas game jam. The theme was \"We rise by lifting others\". We plan to continue working on the game after the jam, there are still ideas we weren't able to fully realize!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Mouse - Aim</li><li>Left click - Shoot</li><li>F - Interact</li></ul>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<ul><li>Vincent Dankbaar - Programming</li><li>Mees van Gaalen - Pixel Art &amp; Music |\u00a0https://meestheking.itch.io/</li><li>Teun van Gisteren - Programming, SFX, Unity |\u00a0https://tgofficials.itch.io/</li><li>Prisca Roddeman - End screen pixel art</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T08:21:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7bafc4995f25089eaebad188e5b80e8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MeesTheKing", "TGOfficials"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
