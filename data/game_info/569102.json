UHH!\r\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHis smash television series; Lights, Camera, Smackson chronicles his adventures, and has just been renewed for its 11 season. This time, he's managed to track down a hungry alien species and he's ready to deliver as many knuckle sandwiches as it takes to end their hunger once and for all.\r\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSmackson loves the spotlight of course, and will always move into camera shot. We also know that the aliens hate light and will always move away from the spotlights. Control the Lights, Camera &amp; Smackson all at the same time with the mouse cursor. Good luck!\r\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nLights, Camera, Smackson is a Bear Jams Spring 2021 submission. I wanted to do a lot more with the idea, but ended up missing the first day entirely. For what it's worth though, here it is, and thank you to everyone who took the time to play. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:26:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bf/1bfebc00534a3103d9d29cb1633423dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SpyderByteStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
