Player in the front uses JKL; keys. You may need to click the game for it to work.</p>\n<p>To row, first lift the oar on the side of the boat, and then push the oar in the water on the same side. For example, if the rear player wants to row repeatedly on the left, they will press S then A then S then\u00a0A etc. If you push the oar in the water wrong, you will spin around.</p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>Made during Daylight Savings\u00a0in 0 hours for the 0 hour game jam.
