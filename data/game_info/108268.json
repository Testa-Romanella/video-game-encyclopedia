When the game starts each player is given a color. Colored letters will appear on the screen and you have to press the letter corresponding to your color as quickly as you can.<br/></p>\n<p>It gets pretty crowded with more than 4 people, but that's part of the fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8ab408834bbfaf79c45165e9a8ab27f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["swsteffes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
