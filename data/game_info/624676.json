Now.\r\n<p><strong>Anxiety! In the Club</strong> is a game about, well, anxiety and being stuck in places you'd rather not be. The idea started off as kind of a vent project on how my own anxiety feels and then got developed into this short game when I saw that the Amaze Me Game Jam was happening - so I figured why not, let's make a game in less than a week in an engine I'm completely unfamiliar with (this was my first time working in GameMaker Studio!)</p>\n<p>While there's both a browser and a desktop version available,<strong> the game is best experienced on desktop, with sound enabled!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Content warnings: </strong>depictions of panic attacks and anxiety, (minor) flashing lights, screenshake, sounds of heavy breathing, crowds and laughter<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>player character gets stuck on the moving platforms if they're jumping and the platform goes through them (gets unstuck once the platform moves past them)</li><li>player character gets stuck on random objects (rare, but happens; requires a restart when it happens)</li><li>player character's speed remains slow even when the player enters the blue areas - happened to one of the playtesters, no idea what causes it (possibly related to framerate on lower-end devices)</li><li>browser version: interruption while playing may make it impossible for the game to recognize input (requires reloading the page when it happens)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A, D, arrow keys - walking</li><li>Space - jumping, skipping cutscenes, pressing menu buttons</li><li>Enter - pressing menu buttons</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Design, art, writing, programming - Anthony O (twitter)</p>\n<p>Music - VOiD1 Gaming (itch.io)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:00:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a52/a52d2df9d18c6ccc6e2eb61168dee0b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Anthony O"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
