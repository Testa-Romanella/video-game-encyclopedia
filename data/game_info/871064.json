The infinite void of clicking and watching the number go up. We're talking BIG NUMBERS. Cyber Idler will not disappoint in that regard. In this clicker/idle game, not only do you get to watch your Credits go up and up and up, but you will also be able to use those Credits to upgrade your heroes, buy abilities, and crank out BIG Damage per second on the infinite enemies and bosses you will face. With a robust inventory management system and the gear that drops from the bosses as you slay them, you will be able to outfit your heroes, fighting the good fight, with the correct gear to handle any situation thrown at them. Can't quite get to the higher-level unlocks and generators or feel you need more Credits to upgrade your heroes even more? Why not prestige, get some gems and have your Credit Generator multiplied to reach those expensive upgrades?<br/></p>\n<p>Credits Generator:</p>\n<p>The Credits Generator is where it all starts. Start by upgrading your generator and build up a nice little nest egg to start upgrading your heroes. You can never have too many credits. In fact, there is an infinite supply of them, so get clicking away to afford your first auto generator.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enemies and Bosses:\u00a0(In Development)</p>\n<p>In Cyber Idler, you will encounter an infinite amount of enemies and bosses to take on in your quest of watching the number of credits go up! These enemies range from spaceships to vermin you would find in a sewer. High and Low, your heroes are there to protect you and your Credits Generator. Don't let them down and upgrade them as you see fit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(In Development) Heroes:</p>\n<p>Cyber Idler, at the moment, features 4 distinct heroes, all with their very own abilities and attributes that you can upgrade to help you along in your journey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- (In Development) The Pistol Artist features a fast attack and High Damage Output but lacks in the amount of Health Points (HP) he has.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- (In Development) The Archaic is the Tank of the world. He has RIDICULOUS amounts of HP and will be there to take most of the damage and ensure that your heroes fighting behind him, stay alive.</p>\n<p>- (In Development) The Gumshoe is like the Pistol Artist but with a lower attack speed and puts out a mammoth amount of Damage per second. He features more HP, too!</p>\n<p>- (In Development) The Blackhat Hacker is what many would consider a \"mage\" in classic RPGs. He has the ability to weaken the enemy to make it easier for your heroes to deal more damage in a shorter amount of time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- (In Development) The Whitehat Hacker is the opposite of the Blackhat hacker. She focuses more on the HP of her teammates and tries to protect them in case they get hurt during battle.
