Your only possession is an old flashlight with dying batteries. Among the eerie silence, you try calling for help. Receiving no response, you assume that you're alone. Until you hear the footsteps.</p>\n<p>Can you escape?</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Hearing footsteps other than your own, you instinctively know that this sound is to be avoided at all costs. Throughout the map are hidden clues that must be revealed in order to find a way out. However, the lights in the facility have long ceased to work: the only light left comes from the flashlight in your hand, and it seems to be getting dimmer by the second. But be careful where you point your light: what is seen cannot be unseen, and if you see whoever (or whatever) these footsteps belong to, you'll probably want to unsee it.</p>\n<p>Can you escape, or will you be left fumbling in the dark?</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move around with WASD, and examine objects by left clicking them (a question mark will appear to indicate objects that may be examined).</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Inspired by \"Miss Eyesore\" (https://filipbergkvist.itch.io/miss-eyesore)</p>\n<p>Ambient music made by \"ThrillShowX\" (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6aGkyktim54QjAIVqrx2sg)</p>\n<p>Title screen music by \"NCM Epic Music Ender Guney\" (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHEioEoqyFPsOiW8CepDaYg)<br/></p>\n<p>Scary SFX by \"Ghoulish Grin Films\" (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-9Pdwa25arR79s5uophCg)</p>\n<p>Footsteps SFX by \"SoundEffectsFactory\" (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYIxR_86Ck0sCL26eVuumvQ)<br/></p>\n<p>Old computer terminal model and skin by Michael Carey (http://mcarey134.wixsite.com/michaelcarey)</p>\n<p>Made for Optical Jam #9 (https://itch.io/jam/optical-jam-9)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/2082c2f9796ccc086666afe243ca043a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SorbetOnion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
