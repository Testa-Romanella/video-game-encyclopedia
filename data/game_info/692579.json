Trapped in an alternate reality and on the run, the crew desperately searches for answers while being hunted by the relentless Earth Systems Alliance (ESA). <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Star Shift Origins features a turn-based active time combat system with a maximum party size of 7 and multiple playable characters. There are no levels in Star Shift, instead skills and stat increases are managed by knowledge points acquired from battle which are used to gain new skills and increase stats. Victory in combat relies on the player being strategic to achieve the desired outcome. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition to the standard turn-based combat, Star Shift also implements a tactical battle system for fleet and army combat. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Star Shift implements a complex skill tree system. Customize your characters with unique skills and abilities. Increase stats through passive skills, or learn active skills. Unique skill trees exist depending on the species of the character, as well as their class. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Time has been shattered, only you and your crew can unlock the mystery and correct the damage, before it's too late.<br/><br/><br/><br/>An incredible soundtrack from multiple independent artists will keep the player engaged and in the moment.  <br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T03:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6e/a6e7dadae5fc307898c27623bcf1a655.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 379, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Psychronic Game Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["G-DEVS.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
