Two players go head-to-head with power-ups that allow the player to change the physics of their paddle or alter the way they hit the ball. The ruleset is the same as Pong, where a player has to score 11 points and be up by 2 to win the game.</p>\r\nLeft Player Controls\r\n<p>[Movement]</p>\n<p>W: move the paddle up</p>\n<p>S: move the paddle down</p>\n<p>[Power-Ups]</p>\n<p>A: activate Fast Ball</p>\n<p>Q: activate Curve Ball</p>\n<p>E: activate Grow Paddle</p>\n<p>D: activate Speed Paddle</p>\n\r\nRight Player\u00a0Controls\r\n<p>[Movement]</p>\n<p>I: move the paddle up</p>\n<p>K: move the paddle down</p>\n<p>[Power-Ups]</p>\n<p>J: activate Fast Ball</p>\n<p>U: activate Curve Ball</p>\n<p>O: activate Grow Paddle</p>\n<p>L: activate Speed Paddle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T17:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec6/ec691dc78ef78b63b8b43f5d890a1f7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Zaney"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
