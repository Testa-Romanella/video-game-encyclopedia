Pizza Lad delivers pizzas to his friends until he runs out of pizza. Pizza Lad\u00a0is very happy, but there's a lot of weird stuff going on outside, so getting to his destination isn't always easy. But Pizza Lad keeps delivering pizzas to them because Pizza Lad\u00a0loves his friends very much, even though they don't talk all that much anymore, and never close their front door, and don't really move either...</p>\n<p>\u00a0You know, I think Pizza Lad might not be a very sane and stable lad.</p>\n\n<p>wasd or arrow keys\u00a0to move</p>\n<p>space, enter, or left click to punch</p>\n<p>(once Pizza Lad runs out of pizzas, there won't be a countdown in his home anymore.
