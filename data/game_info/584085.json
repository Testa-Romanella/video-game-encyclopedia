Not long after, he's also let aboard the Garr-00 for his ride home. Considering that it was noted to be their most impressive Space Station, he found it odd that it wasn't very grand. In fact, it was quite moderate in size. After a couple hours of travel in the Garrozlean vessel, everything suddenly came to a shaky halt. In justified confusion, Legacy asked what was going on. It turned out that the Garr-00 was docked at the Asteroid of Death, a place called home by a species known as \"Space Ghosts\". Legacy would have to get the rest of the way back in his own ship, given that the Space Station was too large to pass through. Luckily for him, the Garrozleans repaired and modified his ship to be hyper durable and capable of travel through wormholes. Accepting that this was the only way he was getting back, Legacy followed a Garrozlean Guard to where his ship was parked. It was then that Legacy felt uneasy, swearing that he heard screams echoing in the halls of the station as he was walked through them. Before he could work up the nerve to try and investigate without tipping off the guard, the doors were closed behind him. Getting into his new and improved ship, Legacy knew that the Garr-00 had a darker purpose, and he had a feeling he wasn't gonna like what that purpose was. Can you remotely navigate Legacy's ship through the Asteroid of Death and get him home, or will you get lost searching for the dark secrets that lie waiting in the station?\u00a0</p><p>Controls:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys to Move.\r\n</p>\n<p>Space to Shoot.\u00a0</p><p>Q to Reset.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T02:23:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a2/5a257b722e35ce322359de04232d6ce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheFazbearLegacy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
