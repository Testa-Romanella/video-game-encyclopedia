This is my first game and it took me around 3 weeks to finish this. Kagami is heavily inspired from classic platformers such as Super Mario Bros\u00a0and Sonic. Why you should play this game is simply because the most mind blowing part about the game is that it is not just a game. ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:16:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f969bfa90956a7d1fcdd4bf879a1ba4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raaghav Prabahar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
