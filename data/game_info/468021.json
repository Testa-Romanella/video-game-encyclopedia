He can raise himself out of the water a bit, and lower himself back down.</p>\n<p>Use this riveting ability to tilt a series of floating marble courses,\u00a0<em>precisely </em>controlling a marble to the goal of each one!<br/><br/><br/>Pillaro was created in 48 hours for the GMTK 2020 Jam. There's more I'd like to have done with him but unfortunately time ran very short, and this was my first time using the Unreal Engine in a few years. Let me know what you think!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:31:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/922/922d64a57f72d2776dc893436bd53ab8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WaveParadigm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
