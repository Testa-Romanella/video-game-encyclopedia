The journey, however, proves to be full of surprises and unexpected obstacles. The bus to the city breaks down in the middle of the \"desert\" (we are still under water mind you) and only you can figure out the way to make it operational again... just to discover that you don't have the money for the subway ticket... Maybe working part time in a restaurant will help? Maybe, but this is just the beginning. What other adventures await you in this underwater world of fun riddles and abstract humour? Nobody really knows... well, maybe except the Old Ones.<br/><br/>Meduziak is a laid back point-and-click adventure game inspired by the classics of the genre, especially the Goblins series. The game is mainly focused on solving puzzles to overcome obstacles and weird problems of this deep sea realm.  <strong>The game features:</strong> \"no dead end\" puzzle design, fun minigames, unusual inventory system, hand drawn animation, original music and sound. All of the sound samples are \u201cmouth made\u201d (we do not use any objects to record them). Since the creatures of the sea do not speak any human language, all of the dialogue is symbolic.<br/><br/>If you would like to immerse yourself in this epic journey, feel free to download the <strong>free demo of the game (about 60 min of gameplay)</strong>.<br/><br/>If you like the game and would like to help us in the development process, you can buy <strong>the early access version of Meduziak</strong>. Early access is offered at a correspondingly lower price. It automatically unlocks the next episode of the game and guarantees free access to all subsequent episodes and updates (until the project is completed). The price of early access will increase as the game is developed, until the target price is reached. <strong>Saves from the free demo will work in the early access version</strong>.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-12T03:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66c/66cc67f2657e316dbb8b38d714fffa67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fieldfare Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Fieldfare Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
