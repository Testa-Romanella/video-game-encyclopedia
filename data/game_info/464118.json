Please enjoy:<br/></p>\n<p>\"Randomizer 3000\" is a single player, top down, adventure game that sets the player in the shoes of a scientist who managed to make travel through parallel universes possible thanks to his handy widget, which he always carries around. He also became very lazy with age and he uses this great tool for stupid things, like ordering a pizza and trying to find loose change inside his own house and within houses from parallel universes. Hurry up, the delivery guy will be at your door in 10 minutes. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:07:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f05/f050c627cfa85f694ccbdb79bc5ca0d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nixdixyklo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
