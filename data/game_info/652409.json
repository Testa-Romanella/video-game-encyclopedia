This was my 15th game,\u00a0originally released in October\u00a01994.</p>\n<p>Xenex is a simple space shooter variation on Asteroids, with the added innovation of two player co-operative play, and\u00a0being optionally mouse controlled. Rotate clockwise by moving the mouse right, anticlockwise by moving left, and blast increasing waves of enemies.\u00a0This control scheme was first introduced in Roton (1992). I made many variations of this game for Windows PC: Roton (1999),\u00a0then the 3D Gunstorm (2005), and my last original game, Gunstorm II.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T02:03:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/294b8273a2da682a6d1098fef257834d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
