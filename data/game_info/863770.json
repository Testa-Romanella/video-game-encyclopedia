You can access them by pressing the 'Play' button.<br/><br/>It is not very useful as the save system is not complete in the Sandox option, but we will fix it as soon as possible.<h3>Game Mechanics</h3><br/>There are mechanics in the game such as building, crafting, chilling, collecting materials, speeding up time.<br/><br/>This game is a survival game. Even though there are zombies in the game, the biggest challenge is the cold-temperature balance. The SandBox mod of the game is under construction. Apart from that, there are 3 different sections.
