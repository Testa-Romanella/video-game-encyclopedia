It can move exactly 1 square on it's turn, just like a king in chess. It's illegal for the mouse to move to a square diagonaly away from a cat (just like how a king can't check themselves in chess). There is an exit hole, and on the mouses turn, it will chose the legal move that is closest to the exit. (It's also illegal for it to just stay put on its turn, or move to a space occupied by a cat)</p>\n<p>If it reaches the exit hole, or you run out of turns, you lose and have to try again.<br/></p>\n<p>You win by making the mouse have no legal moves on its turn (basically checkmate).</p>\n<p>Also, remember to make it fullscreen before playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T10:21:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f7/7f7a56febff062944934c251adabba6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LardTheRard"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
