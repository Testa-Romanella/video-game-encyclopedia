It&#39;s main draw will be it&#39;s porn scenes, and it&#39;s gameplay only secondary. It features a cast of mostly (gay) male characters with a decent ratio between humans, anthros, orcs, goblins, and the like. They all have porn scenes which may not necessarily involve the main character, and may present kinks that may not be for everyone. As for the tower defense aspect, it is mostly easy going outside of certain challenge quest, and doesn&#39;t demand a lot of time for the player. If any of that sounds good to you, maybe you&#39;ll enjoy this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T01:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91a/91a786537006636cce3ef394eb9d4539.jpg", "website": "https://anothereidos-r.com/en/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
