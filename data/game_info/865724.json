Press X to pick up and put down crates. (On mobile devices, swipe a direction and tap the screen respectively.) Press Z to undo your last move, R to restart the level, and Esc to go back to the level selection screen.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>You can climb steps one square high by walking into them. Falling two squares is safe, even if you're carrying something, but falling three will hurt.<br/></p>\n<p>Orange boxes are normal, but pink ones are going backwards in time. If you drop a box off a ledge, then in reverse it looks like it's flying up into your hands. That's strange to us, but perfectly normal to the pink boxes!</p>\n<p>If you've seen Tenet, we're doing the scene where the protagonist holds his hand over a time-reversed bullet as if he's just dropped it, and it jumps into his hand on its own. Except instead of a movie, it's a puzzle game.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you to pancelor for the level select fork of Puzzlescript.<br/></p><p>Thank you to Stingby12, TheZachMan, Karoo, Draknek, and Maltramac for the bug reports\u00a0-\u00a0and\u00a0sorry\u00a0for the\u00a0bugs\u00a0and\u00a0exploits.</p><p>And thank you to knexator for the discussion of time travel puzzle games here, without which this game would not have happened!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T10:38:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/adad0db0ff3416fe2e44c82ffe8661cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TophWells"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
