He's probs hungry, so we should force feed him jelly beans until he calms down.<br/></p>\n<p>We based our game around a lightening god, in the form of a spaceship, who was firing lightening rods down at the player. From this we developed a space shooter game with bullet hell mechanics. The art style is a huge element in this game. Even before we had found out the theme we had decided on the art style. Sasha, our artist, had taken inspiration from the works of Mason Lindroth, who made Hylics.</p>\n<p><strong>Developers:</strong></p>\n<p>Johnathon Christopher : Designer</p>\n<p>Sam Dicken : Designer</p>\n<p>Sasha Solomon : Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Music\u00a0</strong><strong>(Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial\u00a0 (3.0) license):</strong></p>\n<p>Reusenoise (Interstellar Mix) by spinningmerkaba (c) copyright 2018 http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/jlbrock44/57395</p>\n<p>Reusenoise\u00a0 (DNB Mix) by spinningmerkaba (c) copyright 2017\u00a0http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/jlbrock44/56531</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f5/9f545b411f80f36e51b4aa8ecbc3b7eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ProfessorDudley"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
