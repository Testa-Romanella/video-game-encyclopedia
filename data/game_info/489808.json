Levels are randomly generated with a recursive backtracking maze generator and are processed into vertex buffers (crudely) because in a fit of naivety, I thought that would be easier than making a few more tiles. Well, at least the levels can be rotated easily this way.</p>\n<p>Generic Robot Adventure! <em>should</em> support any X-Input gamepad and most DirectInput gamepads.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Movement - WASD or Gamepad d-pad/left stick<br/></li><li>Attack - Shift or Gamepad face button 3<br/></li><li>Rotate Map - Q and E or Gamepad shoulder buttons<br/></li><li>Restart Game - CTRL + R<br/></li><li>Return to Title - Escape<br/></li><li>Toggle \"Debug Mode\" - CTRL + D</li></ul>\n<p>While in \"Debug Mode\":</p>\n<ul><li>Zoom map - Z and X</li><li>Spawn Enemy - CTRL + E</li><li>Spawn Boss - CTRL + R</li><li>Spawn Treasure - CTRL + T</li><li>Also, player robot will run while in \"Debug Mode\"</li></ul>\n<p>Source code available\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>Credit - All code and programmer artwork for Generic Robot Adventure! was made by Mushroomstick.</p>\n<p><strong>#olcCodeJam2020</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:29:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dc0b38b5e51dd33648d54bc34ae428a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mushroomstick"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
