First time using Godot and the InkGD addon. I tried to create a game which explores, in a very fictional\u00a0 way, the idea of AI and how what we use to train AI may result in machines that have a better understanding of life then we expect. I think when we do create the \"Sci-Fi\" version of Artificial Intelligence, it will be by mistake. I just hope it's a good mistake.\u00a0</p><p>I tried to make an online version of the game, however I had some issues, so instead I'm releasing it as an executable file. I did enjoy creating the story, I hope I can make a version online in the near future.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/115/1157374d2e9f3dc4b1b906d99e4c17a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GreenCloversGuy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
