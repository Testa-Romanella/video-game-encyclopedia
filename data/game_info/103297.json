Players must barf, build, and crawl up these structures to capture levitating sport-balls and score points. Don't get careless though! Geckos can also discharge power laser beams that will explode other geckos and their carefully constructed vomit-ladders.</p>\n\n<p>a game by theo triantafyllidis &amp; alex rickett<br/></p>\n<p>commissioned by adult swim / etc<br/></p>\n<p>presented in the 2017 UCLA Game Arts Festival @ The Hammer Museum LA<br/></p>\n<p>featured in kotaku &amp; rock paper shotgun<br/></p>\n<p>read the interview on UCLA Game Lab's blog<br/></p>\r\n\ud83c\udfc0\u00a0\u00a0 \ud83e\udd8e\u00a0 \ud83d\udca5", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af4/af484166316c618115f16aadbbe33a40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["theotrian"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
