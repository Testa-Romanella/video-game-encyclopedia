Burj Builder is a superb, physics-based tower building game - only people with quicker building skills need apply. The goal in this brain-teaser is to build the highest and most stable burj possible.<br/>.<br/>Blocks move from one side to another and you have to decide the exact spot to place it. If it fails to land perfectly on the block beneath, you lose a slice of the block - so the next block will be smaller than the previous one.<br/>.<br/>It starts off very easy, but gets hard fast. prepare yourself, you will probably fail a few times before getting it right. <br/>.<br/>Happy building!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:20:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de0/de0d990ae42c8df81803814adfd498e1_LMSoV9a.jpg", "website": "http://www.teensystudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Teensy Studios"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Teensy Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
