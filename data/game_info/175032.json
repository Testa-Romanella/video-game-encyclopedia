They find themselves trapped on a floating island in the middle of the ocean with 5 other Tikis. Tikis must scramble for the Idol to gather favour, once enough favour has been gathered, they must make their way to the top of the tower and finally offer the idol to their deity to win.</p>\n<p>It's not exclusively multiplayer though, as Bots will replace any players not connected! You can host a local server and play solo vs the AI. Players will assume control of a bot-controlled Tiki when they join the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are at the end of the tutorial in game, or if you skipped it. Here they are:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Spacebar - Jump</li><li>Left Mouse Button - Attack</li><li>E - Collect Item</li><li>Escape - Open Menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/3263c90cb6bf96ec3043cd64156fe846.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Adey"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
