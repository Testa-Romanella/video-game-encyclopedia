Your body is in a deep slumber somewhere out in the world but your brain is wide awake, and it can't wait to take over...</strong></p>\n<p>A super duper short visual novel game where you have a conversation with Violet, a character from your dreams, and watch as your sneaky brain plays tricks on you and constantly undermines your decisions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are no right or wrong choices in this game, because there is no right ending. But there is however good and evil... or at least how your character <strong>views</strong> good and evil\u00a0if categorized as animals.\u00a0All choices eventually lead to the same fate. That is unless...you manage to convince Violet to take off her glasses. What is hiding behind them? Your brain will give you the proper clues you need to persuade Violet into showing you.</p>\n<p>~-~-~-~-~-~</p>\n<p><em>(I wrote 95% of the script on my phone while in class, in an hour or two. And I completed all of the artwork in less than a\u00a0week, so you could say this was bit of an impulse project - don't expect perfection.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>I've made the art-pack, full of every asset used in the game at full res (wallpaper too) available for $2.
