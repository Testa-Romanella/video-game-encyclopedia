Sentience has sprouted inside of you, and you must defend your pumpkin siblings from the hordes of humans who want nothing more than to carve them into Jack-o-Lanterns.</p>\n<p>Can you save your pumpkin patch from annihilation?</p>\n<p>Gameplay:<br/>The humans will try to take pumpkins from the pumpkin patch and bring them back to the tables to be carved. <br/>Use your vine-whip and bullet-seeds to scare away to scare them off. But be careful, the teenaged punks will hurt you if you get too close!</p>\n<p>You lose lives when you take damage or a pumpkin has been fully carved at the tables. If you lose three lives, it\u2019s game over.</p>\n<p>Keep the humans at bay for as long as you can.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Movement - \u2018WASD\u2019<br/>Melee attack - \u2018E\u2019<br/>Ranged attack - \u2018Space Bar'</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Ben Germano - Designer/Producer<br/>Catherine Levine - Audio Design/Producer<br/>Everest Marshall - Environment Artist <br/>JJ Prendergast - Enemy Artist/Animator<br/>John Blaikie - Programmer<br/>Julia Pickett-Garcia - Programmer<br/>Keira Wentworth - Player Artist/Animator, U</p>\n\n<p>Audio sources:<br/>Walking Sounds: https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/347850/<br/>Carving: https://freesound.org/people/PsychoPancake/sounds/325223/<br/>Enemy \"OW\": https://freesound.org/people/Topschool/sounds/442602/<br/>Spitting seeds: https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/477782/<br/>Baseball bat: https://freesound.org/people/Taira%20Komori/sounds/215024/<br/>Crow Sound: https://freesound.org/people/straget/sounds/404687/<br/>Button Click: https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/448086/<br/>Whip sound: https://freesound.org/people/biawinter/sounds/408089/<br/>Splatter:https://freesound.org/people/GagaMan/sounds/88511/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:15:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b0/2b016156b6c2fa5f28930fba00e9bc6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bsg2bsg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
