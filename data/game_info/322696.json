Munch your way into the skies.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the JamDNA #15 within 96 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left click</strong>, <strong>E </strong>or <strong>Space ba</strong><strong>r</strong> to jump (your jump replenishes after having passed through a sweet or having jumped out of a candy floss).</li><li><strong>A </strong>and <strong>D</strong> keys move the player left and right respectively.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game Jam Criteria:\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Endless Runner\r\n</strong><ul><li>The game is a vertical endless runner, the game can be played forever but it does get progressively more difficult. The walls around the screen constrict and less interact-able objects are spawned - causing the player to make smarter choices when plotting the character's trajectory.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hyperactive</strong><ul><li>The main character is hyperactive in their design. The gameplay is also quite over the top in it's style and game feel - prioritising quite hectic and fast paced gameplay.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Happy</strong><ul><li>The main character is in a quite emotionally happy place - they even have a large toothy grin planted across their face. The art style and design of the game is light hearted and happy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chiptune</strong><ul><li>The game uses upbeat chiptune music to further enforce the happy criteria. It is also a bit annoying and, therefore, it could be interpreted as 'hyperactive'.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Follow me for gamedev stuff on Twitter over at: https://twitter.com/RobThomasWhite\r\n</p>\n<p>or on Instagram at: https://www.instagram.com/robwhitedeveloper/\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS / DISCLAIMER (The assets listed below were not created by me, everything else was):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>One public\u00a0domain\u00a0music\u00a0track (main theme song):</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/4-chiptunes-adventure<br/><br/><strong>One font, free use</strong><strong>:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>https://www.1001freefonts.com/carnet-de-voyage.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:07:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12f/12f056d3e7ff08f2ef6d0b923f129a6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Robert White"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
