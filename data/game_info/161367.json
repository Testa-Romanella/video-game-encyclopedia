The concept behind the game is that there are two incomplete platforms, that look like one due to the single perspective. The game is a\u00a0proof of concept for what could be an infinite runner type game\u00a0and was created in Construct 2. Done as a portfolio project for my dual enrolled Game Design class.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b41/b41c48bb8ac7968b67bdef50d6caf017.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bryce Myers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
