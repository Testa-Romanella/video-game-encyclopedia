There are no rules and no complex game mechanics, Loopomotive is a wholesome and relaxing game with a simply mechanic, a joyful soundtrack and cute graphics to brighten your day. Spot the curious peeking sloths as you go through 15 unique levels set in a variety of sceneries.<br/><br/><h3>How to play:</h3><br/>You drive a train that is stuck in a loop and is unable to fully stop: You can only accelerate, slow down and occasionally use the emergency brake (when it is fully charged).<br/><br/>Levels in Loopomotive are completed by either running a pre-defined number of loops around the track, surviving until the end of a countdown, or letting a number of cars pass through the tracks safely.<br/><br/>You lose the level if you hit a vehicle and cause any accidents. Just one accident is too many. (Come on, you don't want to make the sloths sad, do you?)<br/><br/><h3>What you can do:</h3><br/><ul><li>Explore 15 levels with unique sceneries, from the underground to the outer space</li></ul><ul><li>Find adorable sloths hidden in each level</li></ul><ul><li>Unlock multiple game achievements that add replayability</li></ul><ul><li>Pimp your ride and have the coolest train (possibly in the entire world) with unlockable custom skins</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T17:32:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/366/3669f630ed714c5ea697094c7eca721a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ikturi", "Shy Pixel"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Shy Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
