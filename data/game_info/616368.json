Spikes.</strong> A\u00a0dastardly eagle bent on taking your most prized hiker possession. Are you gonna take that sitting down? Didn't think so! So get on up that mountain and take back what's rightfully yours!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No Cups?<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>So, let's face it... alone you're pretty useless. But hey, you can still do the good ol' tried-and-true run and jump stuff, right? That's something.</p>\n\n<p><strong>With Cups?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Oh, you found some of your climbing gear, that's great! <strong>Pick up those cups</strong> and the real fun starts!</p>\n\n<p>With them, you can cling to walls! Sorta like a delayed wall jump. Just one thing, though. <strong>You only get two cups for each jump.</strong>\u00a0Whoever said climbing a mountain would be easy, right?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Try, Die, Repeat.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Yeah so turns out this whole mountain-climbing thing is actually really difficult. Steer clear of those spikes if you can. If you can't, well, you can at least enjoy the fireworks, right?</p>\n<p>If you know what's good for you, you'll <strong>hit every checkpoint flag</strong> on your way. These harness the mystical powers of <strong>mountain-climberness</strong> and <strong>platformer tropes </strong>to make sure you don't flip out every time you have the misfortune of hitting a spike. You still might, but at least your PC will probably survive. Probably.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kick that Eagle's Butt!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Eagles, who needs em' right? Well, probably the ecosystems they're a part of, but in your case there are more important things to consider. You've gotta get your backpack back (...pack)!</p>\n<p>So face that eagle head-on and show him what you're made of!</p>\n<p>...just not literally. Figure of speech. He'll rip you apart if you go toe to toe... just sayin'.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0- Features -</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Three tough-as-nails levels that'll test your platforming prowess.</p>\n<p>One swooping, soaring boi.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0rockin' soundtrack by\u00a0Aaron Weatherford.</p>\n<p>Built-in gamepad support.</p>\n<p>Cool blast-processed parallax backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0- See more -</strong></p>\n<p>For more updates on this project and others, visit\u00a0my youtube page for devlogs on my gamedev journey, or\u00a0follow me on Twitter to see updates on all of my work!</p>\n<p>Also, make sure to\u00a0follow Aaron Weatherford on Twitter\u00a0to see more of his awesome stuff!</p>\n<p>Backgrounds: <br/>Stage 2 -\u00a0Aamatniekss<br/>Remaining art by\u00a0Diego del Solar - Shackhal</p>\n<p>Font:\u00a0</p>\n<p>NotZelda Overhead Adventure Tiles by Raphael Azcueta (LUNARSIGNALS), licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license. <br/>Creative Commons License <br/>#NotZelda Asset Pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T10:10:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/164/16491210538e44f87f5cd1cf337da579.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Baron"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
