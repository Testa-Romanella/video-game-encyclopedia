Ad", "description": "<p>Help Blue to go up!<br/><br/>Infinite levels and dozens of enemies with different behaviours!<br/><br/>Controls:<br/><br/>Control Blue is very simple, just touch the screen and Blue will hook to the pegs. Let it rotate over to increase speed and destroy the \u201cenemy-mines\u201d.<br/><br/>Key features:<br/><br/>This game is made by a solo developer with GdevelopTM (and PhotoshopTM).<br/><br/>The difficulties will increase level after levels including bosses every 10 levels. Save the coin on the game and increase the length of \u201cstar power\u201d or buy Blue lives.<br/><br/>Your suggestions &amp; feedback are precious, for letting me create better versions. Maybe you would like more stuff to buy? Maybe an auto-save? Maybe the possibility to have the game on other platforms?<br/><br/>If you like my game please rate and give reviews.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Music and Sound effects by Eric Matyas<br/><br/>www.soundimage.org<br/><br/>Thanks:<br/><br/>I would like to thanks Elena for suggestions, Dino Paolo for help on mathematic and \u201cGruk\u201d and others on \u201cGdevelop Forum\u201d for tips.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T02:40:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc3/fc3d40cada1a063b82c9d35e50706bed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["vstudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
