In its current state, the game is beatable in a few hours. If people like it, I have plans to expand with more towns, landscapes, and quests.\u00a0 I will release a Linux version as well if people are interested.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/65754e5a5aa3d4e54eaac037a80bf36d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jeremy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
