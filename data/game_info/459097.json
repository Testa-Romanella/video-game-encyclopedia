Touching the cup, she finds herself whisked away from School to a dark, dank cell, her only company a hungry rat and an ominous painting, both watching her closely.<br/><br/>Deprived of her wand and most of her possessions, Sophia will have to find a way to escape from her prison before whoever orchestrated her capture returns, forcing her to put her wit, creativity, and fledgling knowledge of magic to the test. <br/><br/>Designed in Adventure Game Studio,<em> Sophia McGrath and the Strange Invitation</em> is a Point n Click adventure made in the style of old Sierra On-Line and LucasArts games, as well as a work of fan-fiction set in the Universe of Harry Potter.
