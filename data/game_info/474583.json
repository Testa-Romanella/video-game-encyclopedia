Play through a multitude of levels, but run out of lives and it's back to level 1 for you. Earn money based on the score you got for each run that can be used to buy different kinds of powerups to help you conquer the challenge. Choose from three difficulties that incrementally ramp up the speed of the game, but also the rewards. For those looking for a challenge, a timer keeps tracks of how long your run takes so shoot to complete it in the lowest time possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/527fd7f9c92e5de9236a7abc3cea7194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Searcy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
