It's not my best work but I still think it turned out okay.</p><p>The basic idea is that your control a swarm of fish and are trying to avoid sharks that are attacking you. You do this by moving out of the way. And to gain more protection from getting eaten you can pick up new fish for your swarm by getting near the fish around you.</p><p>Hope you enjoy it :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b223d4874941bba5628a0a7ef28ac9eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piffle"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
