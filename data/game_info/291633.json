If you can survive that long.</p>\n<p>You have extremely limited food and water supplies, and you must rely on what you find on the planet to be able to survive long enough to find the remnants of your ship and piece it back together.</p>\n<p>Controls: Type commands to perform actions in-game, use arrow keys to control the main menu. You can also press F11 to switch fullscreen, and Esc to quit.</p>\n<p>NOTE: If you have trouble seeing the text or it's not pleasant to look at, you can press F10 at any time to change the text colour.<br/></p>\n<p>this is only the first version of the game and it has had less testing than I would like.
