That will motivate me <br/>to update the game and\u00a0make the game more fun to play.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers! :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T09:55:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/820/820f956a02f7f676edc2e4b3803c911b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Microbex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
