Approaching a planet or satellite will give us the option of landing there. And thus, continue our exploration on the surface of each planet or satellite in order to pry and learn more about our neighboring planets or satellites.<br/>The game brings together a simulation of the kinematics of space (physics of movement in space) as well as a most faithful and consistent representation of gravity and the atmosphere of each planet or satellite.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T06:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c6/0c6bb32ee19d5de8f7ea3e470f684450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ruben"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
