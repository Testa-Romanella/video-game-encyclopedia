She embarks on a perilous journey to find the source of the problem and restore the river to its former glory, facing dangerous enemies and unexpected allies along the way.</p>\n<p>How to play: Place the playable characters in the front line, depending on the row you want to use. The objective is to get all your characters to the right side of the battleground. Don't get caught by the soliders! Finish your placement and start moving with leftclick to the tile you want to move to. Your characters have a special ability with rightclick that can be used once per combat challenge to help you get to the other side. Remember: On rows with obstacles no characters can be placed. Some soldiers move, others just stand still. Shooting a standing soldier will cause his surrounding defences to fall. Use that to finish the challenge, but most importantly, make the characters work together. Only then, you will be able to solve the challenges.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Attacks:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Girl: Throw a stone downwards in a vertical line.<br/>Hunter: Shoot a blowdart straight.<br/>Warrior: Shoot an arrow straight.<br/>Diablo Huma: Use magic in a diagonal line.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T06:55:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/861aa247814f57bf3e956c0cd731b4b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stefem04"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
