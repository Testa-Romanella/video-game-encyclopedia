He doesn't know where he is, who he is, how he got to this unknown place and why this all happened. His mind is completely wiped out and all he can do is explore and figure out these questions himself but he can not do it without you. Can you help Callum regain his memories and escape the Dreamverse? Callum believes you can do it so let us see, shall we?<br/><br/>Here is a bit about this game:<br/>This game is a story-oriented 2d platformer game where all you can do at the moment is run, jump and crouch. Do not worry though because I am willing to add more mechanics, characters besides Callum, enemies, more cutscenes and so much more stuff trust me on that, and please be patient. This is my 1st game and I was learning how to use Godot (My game engine) during the time of making this game. This game took me since march 2021 to make and I'm really proud of this game.<br/><br/>WAIT! there is one more thing I want to say!<br/>If you would like to be a part of the Callum - Under The Hood community and support me then please join my discord server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/NKkjMUKqGW\u00a0This would really help me and motivate me to make more games in the future Thank you all so much for playing my game and I love you all!<br/><br/>I give you all another thank you for playing my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T08:42:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/621/6215f60a0ed5c2a88ba52981130c057a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kobi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
