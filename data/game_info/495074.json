You remember the forest now. Walking. But then the ground, or wh--THUD. Nothing. Are you dead? No. Are you sure? Ow ok no you're definitely alive. It's just pitch black here. You fell. Where are you. Need to find a way--OW. Ok standing is hard. Wait what's that? A light? You inch forward, arms outstretched, feeling nothing. It's damp. The thud still echoes. Is this place...alive? No that's crazy, just calm down. Ok you feel something now. It's the light, it's getting brighter. It's so cold. You can see a little. Barely. Just silhouettes. There's an opening ahead. Need to keep going. Need to escape.</em><br/><br/><br/>In Grotto, you find yourself trapped in a dark cave and the only way out is to feel around to reveal the world, composed\u00a0 of millions of tiny dots.\u00a0Grotto is a large cave that takes time to explore. We hope you can take it at your own pace and discover what awaits you in the depths. The game is best experienced using room-scale VR and a large play area. Dim or turn of the play area boundaries for a better experience,\u00a0\u00a0if it is safe to do so.<br/><br/>Made with L\u00d6VR<br/><br/>Sounds<br/>Windy_Night_02C.wav by\u00a0dheming<br/>Dark Cave Drone by\u00a0Kinoton<br/>Digging a Hole and Shovelling Soil/Dirt by\u00a0Ali_6868<br/>waving flag by\u00a0AlaskaRobotics<br/>Flapping Gloves by\u00a0Sheyvan<br/>cloth flaps 1 by\u00a0exe2be<br/>tumble_downstairs_a.wav by\u00a0malexmedia<br/>Water Dripping in Cave.wav by\u00a0Sclolex<br/>Royal sparkle whoosh centre.wav by\u00a0alexkandrell<br/>SFX_TouchToLight_2.wav by Dneproman<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:53:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c7/8c7c83d250eed4809ee5cc5ef5235e63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Witch Warlock"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
