However, there is an unfortunate problem where the water doesn't cause the plant to grow, and instead, it only causes the labyrinth containing the water to grow, not the plant. Each time you water the plant, you must travel farther and farther to retrieve the water until you eventually fall to ghosts which will only get faster the longer the game goes on.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T11:38:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c3/1c3513bd0fd2d7f0ec25f2c721a9b3bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarmadileManteater"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
