In this mode, rocks get sucked towards the vacuum <strong>much faster</strong>, but with a lot <strong>less control.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I hope you have fun trying the game out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f673f3c0831a1b11c5702d89fc4114f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlorianHoll"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
