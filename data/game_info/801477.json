{"id": 801477, "slug": "bullet-hell-supplement-ruleset", "name": "Bullet Hell Supplement Ruleset", "name_original": "Bullet Hell Supplement Ruleset", "description": "<p>This adds on to the base game system, this is for both Version 2 and Version 2.1 of Bullet Hell Reverence. I noticed that Health Bars, Energy, and other Enhancements were missing. However, fret not! This is not the end of the Supplements at all. There will be more updates, more fixes, and other things available to put into the Base System of Both 2.1 and Version 2.\u00a0<br/>-Large Halbert now has a Dynamic Kill.\u00a0When the Pilot has 30 Health or less. The character is able to increase the roll, to go for an instant kill. They would need to roll a 6d9 to do it.\u00a0<br/>-You can now rip people out of their Mecha! They'll need to be Lowered health, this can be anywhere between 20/10/ or in the 30's. I put it vague for a reason because, I wanted people to have fun with it.\u00a0<br/>-All Mecha when build have a 100 Health bar at the start of each game. Weight doesn't matter to increase Health; All Mecha shares the same Health Bars.\u00a0<br/>-New Feature known as Energy is able to be applied to the Mecha. This is an optional rule to apply to your game, however due not that it can be a very messy and chaotic playthrough if you use it, there are plenty of Energy weapons to use such a Bullet Hell Triple Shot, Bullet Hell Rapid Fire, and Blue Lions roar to name a few Energy weapons. EN for most Mecha (If used in games) use 150 to start with, which a reasonable start for base games.<br/>-Armor applies to Health, it is a brand-new mechanic, this isn't too big of one, but instead of Mech's regenerating Health and becoming a real annoyance, armor is there to fully increase some health and to act as an extra shell to protect the pilot; so that they reduce huge blows when they're hit in combat rounds. Which helps when you don't want to die so quickly in games generally.\u00a0<br/>-Beam Magnum now has a Dynamic kill action as well. When the\u00a0Pilot has 20 health or less, they can increase the Beam Magnum roll to a 10d6, which the DK is called \"The Last shot\" and this pretty much instantly kills the character that they're fighting if damage is high enough in-game, generally.<br/></p>\n<p>So that's the recent fixes and patches for some weapons and new Mechanics, people can use. More updates will come later on.</p>\n<p>(The picture is not my artwork; all credits go to the owner who made it.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T07:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/351/3516b158f5cfa71c35b91cc17d8984a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LoverofDogs123"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
