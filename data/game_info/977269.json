While this system entails some inherent risks, it has proven to be extremely efficient.<h3>Energizing and recycling bullets</h3>The <strong>Bullet Tower</strong> shoots basic bullets that don't carry much energy. It is, therefore, desirable to energize them in <strong>Energy Towers</strong> before they hit batteries. It is also useful to recycle bullets that do not hit any battery in the <strong>Eco Tower</strong>. This earns the company <strong>Eco Credits</strong> and keeps environmentalists at arm's length.<br/><br/><h3>Changing bullet direction</h3>Due to the complicated layouts of our factory floors, it is often necessary to change the bullet path to avoid an obstacle. This can be achieved by <strong>Bend Towers</strong> that change the bullet's direction by 90 degrees.<br/><br/><h3>Splitting bullets</h3>Building multiple <strong>Bullet Towers</strong> to increase the number of bullets in circulation can be quite expensive. So here's an alternative: <strong>Split Tower</strong> takes an already existing bullet on the input and splits it into three bullets with reduced energy.<br/><br/><h3>Fusing bullets</h3>To create the most powerful bullets, it is necessary to utilize the <strong>Fuse Tower</strong> that fuses the energies of three incoming bullets into one. The combined bullet has very <strong>high energy</strong> and pierces through batteries instead of being destroyed. This way, only a fraction of the energy will be used for charging, and the rest will pierce through.<br/><br/><h3>Routing bullets</h3>The <strong>Junction Tower</strong> is quite versatile and can be used in various situations. It can chain bullet streams, fuse them, and perform complex bullet-routing tasks. Furthermore, the routing direction can be switched when hit from the side with the lever.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T04:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/663/6633156f1e376ad0a73596e8ff882661.jpg", "website": "https://omnibullet.cz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arbitrary Combination"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Arbitrary Combination"], "esrb_rating": null}
