These sisters named the Zeenu sisters are believed to be magical, knowledgeable beings, far more intelligent than the likes of humans, some dream to see them but most believe them to be Evil Witches who don\u2019t deserve a place in the vast and vibrant land of Barresmeare. These Humans drove the witches apart and now they live separately in hiding in the enormous and enchanted Joraniska forest. That is until now! A catastrophe has struck upon the forest and the sisters must locate each other to save the place they and their ancestors have lived in for centuries!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>This project was my first ever 2D game designed in late 2018/ early 2019. Unfortunately as this was the start of my game design campaign I didn't save the names of all the asset packs I used. However they were all free packs on Open Game Art -https://opengameart.org/. Credit to the designers as they are beautiful packs, sorry I do not have your names or links - If you happen to see this, please message me and I will credit you here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is a 2D\u00a0platformer and is narrative driven. It contains 5 levels which increase in difficulty. The challenges are the traversal and various enemies you will have to face. I designed the story, levels and basic coding for the game. Assets and art work are <strong>not mine.\u00a0</strong>As I said before this is my first 2D game so I learned a lot from the process. The difference in coding and level design between 2D and 3D is expansive but very interesting.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bf/4bfb696966e634bfaffc864aa340752d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JFC132"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
