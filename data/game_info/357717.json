To space out you could go to sleep, drink something, eat something or fall over something. After you'll fell down I wanted to make a dodging game where you run on the streets and visualize funky stuff with shaders.</p>\n<p>Plans didn't go as planned.. On wednesday I only managed to put 5 hours in this jam because of deadlines at work.. I already sort of gave up..<br/></p>\n<p>But then I got this new idea! I thought why not.. with about 5 hours left for producing this game I started to set this little game up!</p>\n<p>First it took me about 1.5 hour to find the assets fitting my idea in my head.Here a list of all assets:</p>\n<ul><li>https://ansimuz.itch.io/explosion-animations-pack &lt; for explosions</li><li>https://vnitti.itch.io/grassy-mountains-parallax-background &lt; background</li><li>https://hugues-laborde.itch.io/cartoon-viking-character-pack &lt; player</li><li>https://hugues-laborde.itch.io/cartoon-warrior-character-pack &lt; enemy</li></ul>\n<p>Then it took me about 3 hours to create the whole game using my own code I also use for my html5 build series blog on my website! www.justinbieshaar.com/blog\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end I am happy I still managed to create something small and fun. Next time I will start small, but hey, it has been 2 years since my last participation in any game jam. Needed some reality check if I really could make something complex after work hours!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/293/293f4fe90a053b0af0b6fc78c5e3ffbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JScotty"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
