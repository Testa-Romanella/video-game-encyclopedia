F###, I don't know.</em>\"\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSo in this game you acquire knowledge so you CAN know, and in doing so eventually get hired to be a BUSINESS DOG. (If you know enough human business knowledge, people won't realize you're a dog!)\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Sneak around and find business knowledge to win!<br/>\n</strong>\n</p><p>Release notes:</p><ul><li>\r\n\tCompatible with WASD or X360 controller (you could also rebind Horizontal, Vertical, and Look Axis in input options during startup).</li><li>On the part with the six rotating guards standing around pillars, sometimes they get out of sync and it can make things really difficult / impossible. Sorry.\r\n</li><li>Designed for 720p/1080p.
