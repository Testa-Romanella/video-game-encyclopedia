The champion\u2019s abilities should provide a unique and more <strong>diverse</strong> direction for the game, while also being <strong>familiar</strong> and fitting in with the games current state of mechanics. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Unfortunately for a two week prototype I did not have the time to implement the Battlerite energy system that adds a lot of complexity to the game. But I still concerted the abilities that would use energy.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>The abilities:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>M1 \u2013 Ice Shard (Projectile)</strong></p>\n<p>7 damage, Cast time: .3s, Cooldown .2s, Energy Gain 5%</p>\n<p>Ice Shard applies Frost. Frost slows the enemy by 10% for 6 seconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>M2 \u2013 Freeze Ray (Ray cast)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>20 damage, Cast time: .8s, Cooldown 7s, Energy Gain 8%\r\n  </p>\n<p>Consumes Frost dealing 8 bonus damage, and inflicting a Fading Snare for 1.5s to enemies hit.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Space\u2013 Frost gate (Teleport)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>6 damage, Cast time: .1s, Cooldown 8s, Energy Gain 5%\r\n  </p>\n<p>Airtime .8s \u2013 Applies frost to surrounding destination.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q \u2013 Shadow Nova (AOE)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>12 damage, Cast time: .2s, Cooldown 10s, Energy Gain 5%\r\n  </p>\n<p>Inflicts a 15% snare for 1s.

Attacks every 2 seconds for 8 damage. Each attack applies, or consumes frost. Consuming frost heals the Lich for 8 and inflicts a 15% snare for 1.

Skeleton health: 20\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>Due to the scope of this two-week project. I did not allocate time to concept Battlerites as I would not be using them in the playable prototype.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the prototype!</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think \u2013 Game dev\u2019s love feedback :)\r\n</p>\n<p>__________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Dev Commentary</strong>: AKA - How I balanced the Lich Lord for the Design Challenge</p>\n<p>Pretty much the first thing I did was collect data. I hopped into Battlerite and tried every Ranged Champion ability, marking down every available stat, and approximating for non-text learned \u00a0mechanics as well. \u00a0</p>\n<p><em>View Screenshot2 - Average M2 Abilities for Champions and Lich Lord</em></p>\n<p><em>View Screenshot3 </em>-\u00a0Average Ultimate Ability for Champions and Lich Lord</p>\n<p>After I had a sufficient amount of data I began to rank each ability based on a few different metrics like DPS, Utility, Maximum Damage, and Overall Value. Making sure that each ability was properly represented by the chosen metric system. Eventually coming together to form a overall Power Rating for Ranged Champions in Battlerite.</p>\n\n<em>View Screenshot4</em>\n<p>After I had all the metrics for the default characters, I designed my new abilities to align with the overall average power level of it's target ability slot. I toned some abilities down to make sure I was below the overall power curve. It's more fun to give than take'th away, (atleast at first)!</p>\n<p>--- After I had done the initial ability concepting it was much easier to create the task list for how I would code the game... err Design Challenge Prototype!</p>\n<p><strong>:Edit: Added<em> </em><em>Postmortem</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ab/3ab90ca2b8e2be474eb67b618d9da393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flowG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
