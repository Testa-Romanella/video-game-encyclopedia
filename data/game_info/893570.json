Once you have the treasure, you can move on to the next level. The game needs to be improved, first of all, the map layout will be adjusted to make more innovative maps. The second thing is to make the game more challenging, to add more operational challenges along the way, I think the levels in the current game are too easy. The third point will add more collectible items to help players pass the level while adding more challenges. (However, collection is optional, players can choose whether to complete it or not according to their own game needs)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T08:14:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/755/75589d9da10f92c54d237bd6666f260f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ziadeity"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
