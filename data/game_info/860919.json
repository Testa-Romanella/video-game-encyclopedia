TacOps is a 3 - level\u00a0shooting game with enemies patrolling the levels and attacking\u00a0the player. The player wins by shooting to kill\u00a0each enemy on the level and hiding behind walls to escape their field of view.\u00a0</p><p>The first level begins by introducing the player to the controls of the game. This level only has one enemy to kill and there's only one wall for hiding. The second level increases the number of enemies and there are more walls to give the player opportunities to reload. The last level has larger green enemies with slightly more health and the player still only has 100 health to kill all 14 cubes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD for moving, Spacebar for jumping, mouse for moving head and shooting, R for reloading</p>\n<p>Github:\u00a0https://github.com/jbautista5435/Exercise-3-Game-Dev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T19:57:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cde08bdb6f30a6a19a87849537c69f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tc2965"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
