Now he doesn\u2019t know who\u2019s taking care of who...!<h3>CHARACTERS</h3><br/><strong>Kazari Saionji</strong> (Voice: Anzuhana)<br/>The daughter of wealthy business tycoons, she was actually raised by Minato\u2019s late grandmother, who was her maid at the time. Out of love and a sense of filial obligation, she assumes responsibility for Minato\u2019s living expenses after hearing about his plight. Thanks to her rich parents owning the entire campus, she happens to be the board chair of the same school she attends as a student\u2014Whitebell Girls\u2019 Academy\u2014and so conveniently enrolls Minato there, too.<br/><br/>Despite her attempts to come off as a refined, elegant young lady, in many ways she\u2019s surprisingly clumsy and below average. As her roommate, Minato soon discovers that she\u2019s not only slow and socially awkward, but gets lost easily and needs her hand held for the simplest of tasks...<br/><br/><br/><strong>Yuzu Kifune</strong> (Voice: Akane Ueda)<br/>Minato and Kazari\u2019s classmate and dormmate, and the head of the school\u2019s newspaper club. Another daughter of a prominent family, but unlike Kazari, she\u2019s genuinely charming, friendly, and almost too accommodating to Minato...<br/><br/>That might make it sound like she\u2019s the ultimate Japanese tradwife, but when it comes to domestic chores, she\u2019s beyond salvation. She\u2019s also a terminally curious and surprisingly stubborn tomboy who tends not to sweat the small stuff\u2014to the point where her dorm room is a constant pigsty. And as if that weren\u2019t enough, she\u2019s actually confident(!) about her terrible cooking... How can a girl so good at everything else be this catastrophic when it comes to household affairs?!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Hinata Ogaki</strong> (Voice: Airi Himekawa)<br/>Minato\u2019s junior dormmate and a member of the library committee. Her family struck it big only recently and now controls an up-and-coming business enterprise. Despite being a \u201cnouveau riche,\u201d she has none of the usual smugness that comes with it. In fact, she\u2019s too caught up in being a huge fantasy nerd and edgelord to really care about things like family standing or \u201chaving a decent personality\u201d anyway...<br/><br/>Speaking of edgy, she insists on calling herself \u201cZarathustra, General of the East.\u201d Indeed, as one of the Demon Generals of the Four Heavenly Kings, she apparently already rules the world as we know it. Her story often changes, though, so sometimes she\u2019s \u201cabout to invade\u201d us in the near future, instead of already being in control. For all her constant cringiness, however, she\u2019s actually not so bad underneath. Heck, she\u2019ll even apologize if you tell her off hard enough, waterworks and all.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Minato Asuka</strong> (Voice: Sara Ayumi)<br/>The protagonist of this game! Left without anyone to rely on after the passing of his grandmother, he was taken in by Kazari and offered a roof over his head, as well as enrollment at her family\u2019s all-girls school. Despite very much being a boy, when dolled up in a skirt he can easily pass for the fairer sex\u2014even without the extra padding. While this god-given talent might help him move through his new school life undetected, he\u2019s still loathe to accept how good a girl he makes...<br/><br/>His hobbies and talents include cooking, cleaning, laundry, and other household chores. In fact, upon moving into the girls\u2019 dorms, he assumed all domestic chore duties himself because he couldn\u2019t bear to see the mess his housemother-less dormmates had made. For his troubles he was later voted \u201cno. 1 ideal housewife\u201d in a campus newspaper club poll.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Miyu Minami</strong> (Voice: Haruto Turuya)<br/>Sits next to Minato in class. Always cheerful and approachable, even towards people she\u2019s only just met. She\u2019s also thoughtful and considerate, easily getting along with most of her classmates. Close friends with Yuzu, who has also invited her to join the same newspaper club.<br/><br/>Despite attending an expensive all-girls school, her family is not that well off and is struggling to pay her tuition. The plan was apparently to ensure that she\u2019s raised with a little more class than they have been able to provide thus far... Unfortunately, though, her grades are at the bottom of the class, much to her parents\u2019 dismay. Miyu, however, doesn\u2019t seem too worried about it.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Nanami Nanami</strong> (Voice: Rin Nanagase)<br/>Minato\u2019s homeroom teacher and math instructor at Whitebell Girls\u2019 Academy. Gets salty if you make jokes about her full name or age. Seems to have landed the unfortunate extra role of looking after Kazari. She\u2019s even the overseer of Dorm II\u2014Minato\u2019s new home. It\u2019s not like she wanted the extra responsibilities, however. She just found herself unable to leave the seemingly helpless board chair to her own devices...<br/><br/>She has two go-to maxims: \u201cI don\u2019t wanna do work\u201d and \u201cWhy do today what you can leave for tomorrow?\u201d As a chronic slacker, she leaves all the housework chores, including looking after Kazari, to Minato once he moves in.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T03:59:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf5/cf53f65f3cb1a9129a87cef587e4b5f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PALETTE-QUALIA"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Shiravune"], "esrb_rating": null}
