Cards will take as long to build in the queue as indicated in the upper left of the card art.</p>\n<p>Card effects suffixed by an 'R' are \"Repeated\" effects, which will affect the point rate (indicated below the appropriate point value, in parentheses). The point rate will affect the point value on a per season basis.</p>\n<p>You may <strong>Draw </strong>up to 10 cards at any time, drawing cards costs either 10 gold or 10 food (depending on which is selected below the draw button). If your hand is full, you can <strong>Purge \u00a0</strong>your hand for either \u00a0military points or monarch points, which costs 2 of the respective point per card purged.<br/></p>\n<p>Some hotkeys have been bound for convenience:</p>\n<p><strong>[ 1 ] </strong>- Play</p>\n<p><strong>[ 2 ]</strong> - Double Speed</p>\n<p><strong>[ Space ]</strong> - Pause</p>\n<p><strong>[ Escape ] </strong>- Restart/Quit<br/></p>\r\nTools Used\r\n<p>- Unity</p>\n<p>- Asprite</p>\n<p>- Audacity</p>\n<p>- Paint.NET</p>\n<p>- YouTube Audio Library</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>- AJ \"MrSerp\" -- Lead Developer / Card Art / Programming / SFX<br/></p>\n<p>- Matt -- Card Art</p>\n<p>- Aaron Kenny -- Music (\"Yonder Hill and Dale\" - YouTube Audio Library)</p>\n<p>- Google Fonts -- Font 1: Philosopher, Font 2: Lato<br/></p>\r\nPost Mortem\r\n<p>I originally wanted to cram more goodness into the project, but, steeped in persistent bugs, I fell short on time. For example, the little world at the top was ideally going to fill with people and buildings as you played cards, but that had to be \u00a0cut for time. <br/></p>\n<p>If I had more time to work on it, I would probably add more cards and events, I feel like card diversity is a bit lacking, but less than a day was spent on actual content generation. More traits could also be added, especially to better incentivize trait rerolling.</p><p>A warning about some of the bugs that made it into the release, be careful when putting cards into the queue, if you're too fast, it will send the card to \u00a0into the ether and still eat up a slot in the queue, the same goes for the hand.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:54:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c33/c33b833b20cacedf7906af494be5b69a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhyNXT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
