It is the fifth instalment of the Devil May Cry series, serving as a reboot. Announced in late 2010 during the Tokyo Game Show, the game is set in an alternate reality in the Devil May Cry series.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s story focuses on the player character Dante, a young man at the start of his saga. Dante is a Nephilim: half-angel, half-demon. He is partnered with his twin brother, Vergil, and is on a quest to kill the Demon King Mundus, who murdered their mother and condemned their father to banishment. Players can use Dante&#39;s iconic sword, Rebellion, and signature handguns, Ebony and Ivory, as well as a variety of other melee weapons and firearms to defeat enemies. The game also introduces Angel Mode and Demon Mode, which are modifiers to Dante&#39;s moveset.</p>\n<p>The re-imagination of the Devil May Cry series was requested by Capcom, resulting in a total reboot. Capcom chose Ninja Theory to develop the game, assisting them to ensure that gameplay was reminiscent, but distinct, compared to previous titles.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2015-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T16:34:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a7263e0ccaf879a00296db0d6d91c854.jpg", "website": "https://ninjatheory.com/?page_id=1315", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 11, "beaten": 34, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 31, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 31, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Ninja Theory"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
