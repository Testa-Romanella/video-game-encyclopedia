It is played with a standard set of 52 playing cards and is closely related to other trick-taking games like Hearts, Euchre, Bridge and Whist.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to take at least the number of tricks that were bid before play of the hand began. Before the game begins, each player decides how many tricks he/she will be able to take. Adventurous players can decide to bid nil or blind nil. No suit is named, as spades are always trump.<br/><br/>The first player begins the game and it will continue in a clockwise order. The next player must play a card in the same suit, if possible. If not, he/she may play a trump or discard.<br/><br/>The player who plays the highest trump wins the trick but if no trump was played then the player who played the highest card in the led suit takes it. That player will lead the next trick.<br/><br/>The game will continue on like this until everyone runs out of cards. Each hand consists of 13 tricks. Spades can\u2019t be led with unless another player has previously played one or if there aren\u2019t any other options.<br/><br/>The player or partnership with the highest score at the end of the game is awarded the win.<br/><br/>SPADES TERMINOLOGY<br/><br/>\u2022 Bidding: When a player looks at his/her hand before a trick and estimates how many tricks they will win in that round<br/>\u2022 Trick: When one card is played by each player. A trick is won by whoever played the highest card in the suit, or the highest spade<br/>\u2022 Trump: A card that has greater power than all other cards. In the case of this game, spades trump all other suits<br/>\u2022 Following Suit: Players must follow the suit of the first card played in each trick, if possible<br/>\u2022 Hand: The cards held by one player<br/>\u2022 Breaking Spades: Spades are broken when a player cannot follow suit and chooses to play a spade<br/>\u2022 Partnership: When you work with the player opposite you to achieve a total number of bids<br/>\u2022 Bag: A bag (sometimes called a sandbag) is collected for each extra trick won beyond the player\u2019s bid. When a set number of bags are collected a penalty is assessed <br/>\u2022 Nil Bid: A risky bid of 0 where players stand to win big but risk an equally large penalty<br/>\u2022 Blind Nil Bid: An even riskier nil bid without looking at the hand before the round begins, which awards or deducts twice the points as a nil bid<br/><br/>TIPS<br/><br/>\u2022 Keep track of cards that have been played! There are 13 cards of each suit in the deck. Play around the cards you know are remaining in the deck<br/>\u2022 Voiding a suit (getting rid of all cards of a specific suit in your hand) is a great way to control the tricks you take with a spade<br/>\u2022 Pay attention to your partner\u2019s play and avoid taking tricks they intend to win<br/>\u2022 Taking extra tricks can sometimes be a good way to stop your opponents from achieving their bids, resulting in big penalties<br/><br/>SUPPORT AND FEEDBACK<br/><br/>If you have any technical problems, please email us directly at uv-support@magmic.com. <br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>FAN PAGES<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter and Like us on Facebook!<br/>www.twitter.com/magmic<br/>www.facebook.com/magmic", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:54:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70faa67ca2742460c06dced3e4f13ab5_hNie0Ca.jpg", "website": "http://www.magmic.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Magmic"], "genres": ["Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Magmic"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
