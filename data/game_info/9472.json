We really hope you will enjoy the experience, as we made it public for just that reason: For you people to get a glimpse of what Medusa could have become with a longer production time and additional funding.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-10T19:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87a/87afd0c38c5a5a3dff8d48798a78c7dc.jpg", "website": "http://gurugames.se/games/medusa/", "rating": 2.19, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 469, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Guru Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Guru Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
