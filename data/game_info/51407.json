{"id": 51407, "slug": "criminal-bundle", "name": "Criminal Bundle", "name_original": "Criminal Bundle", "description": "Criminal Bundle is a first person shooter online multiplayer with low poly esthetic. Shoot other players while trying to open the safe or prevent criminals from run away with the money.<br/><br/>Don\u2019t be fooled by the low poly art! In Criminal Bundle you will need to master the police strategies so that criminals do not escape. You and your teammates will have to decide how to act in the robbery, what weapons you should use and what will be the breaking and entering zone. But as a criminal your strategy will be totally different. You must get to the bank and break the safe. Then, take all the money and run for your life.  Don\u2019t mind the casualties, don\u2019t mind the hostages, just mind the money!<br/><br/><strong>WEAPONS AND CUSTOMIZATION</strong><br/>There are many types of weapons like rifles, pistols, snipers and knife. Choose wisely... or not, it's up to you getting the job done, but how you will do it doesn't matter. That\u2019s why you can pick different characters in both teams, but only the \u201cbad guys\u201d can wear different masks like a horse head, clown face, Mr. President covfefe mask among many others.<br/><br/><strong>MAPS</strong><br/>We will expand the game with new free maps such as supermarket, jewelry store among others. There will be exclusive maps for VIP subscribers.<br/><br/><strong>MONTHLY VIP SUBSCRIPTION, NOT A PAY TO WIN</strong><br/>Criminal Bundle is fun and cheap full game. Players will have lots of content totally free. However, we think some hardcore players may enjoy additional content like skins, masks and maps, but never better guns or somekind of power-ups. We don\u2019t want to be a pay to win game.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad47b8ed14b48a85460611b768bcf905.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/CriminalBundle/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 31, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Higgs boson"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Higgs boson"], "esrb_rating": null}
