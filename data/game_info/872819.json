E. 3000</strong> is one of the best video games ever created. It's my game number 10 and it's the first time I feel this way about my own work. I DO believe this work is genius. And honestly it's all I want you to know at this point. But, of course, it's <strong>my personal opinion</strong> and yours may be completely different.

More than <strong>10</strong> game-play modes and their combinations, different perspectives, forms, space ships, etc! <br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong>  variety and quantity are two different words. SQ R3000 is not a long game. It's \"wide\", not \"long\".<br/><br/>\t+ - <strong>Asystematic Game-Design</strong> (If you have never heard about it - it's all right! Nobody's using it! ...but I do.<br/><br/><h3>ADDITIONAL INFO</h3><ul><li>- [SATURN QUEST SAGA]</li></ul>Saturn Quest is an <strong>Alien Space Opera</strong>, containing multiple episodes that can be played in any order. R.U.N.E. 3000 is a sequel to the previous episode and a prequel to the very first.
