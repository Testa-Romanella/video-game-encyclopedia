You, as young Curdle, must carry on the legacy of your Grandmother and try your best to maintain the factory and complete every order as fast as you can! But beware, the jam season is\u00a0<strong>winding down</strong>, so the final rush of orders are going to start coming in!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for you, the factory power generator has just blown before your first day on the job. Last minute, the engineers replaced the jam machines with\u00a0<strong>wind</strong> up crank generators that power the machines. You must not only make sure the machines start once loading them, but you also must make calls for fruit, load the fruit through vacuum pipes, and fulfill your deliveries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>The web build isn't perfectly optimized and can become more laggy over time of playing it.
