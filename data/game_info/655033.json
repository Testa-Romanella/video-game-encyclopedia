Here's a new mini-game, created to help promote Project: Quimbly, which is currently in alpha development, and available at https://teamquimbly.itch.io/pjquimbly. It features DEB, the debug girl available in-game, drawn by the Team Quimbly member lilstinker. In this mini-game, you are testing DEB's capacity, as well as her ability to increase that capacity under pressure. To do this, you will use a dispenser to create compressed-air pills\u00a0to\u00a0feed\u00a0her,\u00a0which\u00a0will\u00a0then\u00a0inflate\u00a0her\u00a0belly. Pay attention to visual and audio cues, and try to get close to her limit without going over!<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Controls:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Press R to reset<br/>Press Z to advance the text on the second screen</p>\n<p>On the warning screen, there are button toggles for sound, hyper mode, and popping:<br/>The sound button mutes/unmutes all audio, and is also in the testing room.<br/>Hyper mode toggles the range of sizes that DEB's belly will appear in-game (as well as growth rate). Note that normal mode is closer to her intended sizes in Project: Quimbly, while hyper mode is closer to my other mini-games.<br/>If popping is enabled, there will be a cartoony popping effect for when DEB's limit is surpassed. You will not need to restart the game if this happens; she'll recover in a few seconds regardless of this toggle.<br/></p>\n<p>Click and hold the blue button on the dispenser to charge an air pill.<br/>Release the button to drop the air pill, which will appear larger based on how long the dispenser was charged.<br/>Charging the dispenser for too long will cause a temporary malfunction.<br/>Click and drag the air pill to DEB's mouth to feed it to her, which will immediately start inflating her for a short but slightly-varying amount of time.<br/>Alternatively, if you don't think she can hold the air, you can dispose of the air pill in the trash can on the left and start again.<br/></p>\n<p>Click on DEB's belly to thump it, purely for testing purposes. It will rebound less, with different sound effects, based on how tight it is.<br/>Hold down left mouse button on DEB's belly to rub it, certainly for testing purposes. Rubbing it gives a loose indication of if she's more than halfway to capacity, and can also cause a burp, relieving a bit of pressure.</p>\n<p>If DEB's belly surpasses its current capacity, she'll faint for a bit and release the air. Her capacity stays the same, though, so it's just a matter of getting her back to her previous size. If popping is enabled, instead her belly will pop to the same effect, and with no lasting consequences.<br/></p>\n<p>If DEB's belly is very close to its limit when the air pill runs out, her capacity will increase with a \"fwoomp\" sound effect, and then a burp. When her capacity reaches the highest available point, the dispenser's display will read \"fin\" to signal the end of the mini-game.</p>\n<p>Check out Project: Quimbly here: https://teamquimbly.itch.io/pjquimbly<br/>Check out the Project: Quimbly Discord community here: https://discord.gg/AahH7wuVvb<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T15:27:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8d/c8db4aac700e7c28e3692d3f66f1d566.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Blunder Jub"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
