This was just a promotional stunt organized by people from Commodore.\r\n</p>\n<p>However Warhol kept the computer he was given by Commodore and actually used it to make some art.</p>\n<p>Now after 30 years is up to you to use all your retrocomputing skills to retrieve <strong>ART LOST IN TIME</strong>...</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Inspired by documentary on Warhol &amp; Amiga.<br/><br/>As there is no music, so I recommend to listen Amiga Music: Thunder Compilation #2 or some Velvet Undeground.<br/><br/>Drawn mostly in jspaint.app. I used my own game engine (from WIP game) and actual digital art by Andy Warhol. I hope this is fair use.<br/><br/>Challenges taken:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Only use the default MS Paint color palette. (iny my case jspaint pallete)</li><li>Draw your assets without a drawing tablet.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83d/83d5073d848bf4a22423c2e5333f2055.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sever\u00e1k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
