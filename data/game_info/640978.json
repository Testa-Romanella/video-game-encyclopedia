It was mainly an opportunity for me to boost my Javascript knowledge, especially ES6, so I made this little game engine from scratch, with some advices and beta testing from Florent A., thanks pal! So from this point of view I'm quite happy with the result, even though last hours took their toll on code cleaness and consistency.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T06:27:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/989/989ee2e9983674b448dc6aad926036b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ElGregos"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
