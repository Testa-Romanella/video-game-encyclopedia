{"id": 844266, "slug": "the-fox-and-the-hunter", "name": "The Fox and The Hunter", "name_original": "The Fox and The Hunter", "description": "<p>The Fox and The Hunter is a third person shooter prototype that involves the\u00a0player as a fox whose goal is to rescue a cat that is patrolled by an AI/NPC hunter. The\u00a0hunter releases dogs to find the fox. The player has the ability to defend themselves by shooting,\u00a0which will enable them to kill the dogs and the hunter and get to the cat.</p>\n<p>This prototype was worked on by Sabelo, Kate (keightyrose) and Molebogeng. We're a group of 3rd year Game Design students who get accessed on our ability to rapid prototype.</p>\n<p>We attempted a third person shooter. She's not perfect, but we love her. Kate wanted to work on an AI enemy as part of her journey in another personal project coming soon, so we thought about how we could implement that into a game now. We felt a tps would be a good fit. Here is what each member worked on:</p>\r\nKateHunter and dog (enemies) controllers, and\u00a0 asset integration.SabeloLevel design, world building, and asset integration.MolebogengCharacter and gun controllers, and UI.\r\n<p>In more detail,\u00a0I (Kate) wanted to make an AI enemy using nav mesh agent properties.\u00a0 Having a hunter as the main enemy seemed appropriate, but I decided to add in faster but weaker dogs as enemies to create more dynamic game play. I worked on tweaking some of the world's development and character controller\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>**PLEASE NOTE**</p>\n<p>The game only ends when you eventually kill the hunter (and no other way yet). The character controller is also fighting us - it's hard to look in the opposite direction and run back to a previous spot.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>**BUT PLEASE PLAYTEST**</p>\n<p>We would really love for you to engage with this prototype and let us know what you liked,\u00a0what we could have better, what you maybe felt it lacked or even what you would have liked to see/get from it!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T18:53:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01e/01ea4dd6b134a4a8afb4644d2b5359df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["keightyrose"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
