Haven't you?</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Headspace, a bridge between your plane and others. This area was created by none other than William, a strange being that greeted you when you signed up for his service of sorts. According to him, he uses the headspace as a place for people to \"dump their grievances\" as he puts it, he allows people into the headspace and provides them with a journal where they're free to write whatever they please. He also has designated helpers with him to help the client with journaling or talk with them if need be. He claims to be doing this for research, as he's never come into contact with humans like yourself before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Explore this new world and the strange beings in it, who knows, you may make some newfound friends.
