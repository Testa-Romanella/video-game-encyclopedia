Crawl through a randomly generated dungeon, collecting weapons and fighting monsters on your way to explore every nook and cranny.

You can beat each dungeon by simply finding and opening all locked doors. However, you only begin with 3 keys, so you must find the rest keys scattered among chests in different rooms. Guarding these chests are enemies called the Jellycrabs, which will lunge towards you if you get too close. Every time they hit you, the screen\u2019s window will shrink causing limited visibility. Fortunately, chests may also contain healing potions (increasing window size), increased damage potions, and most importantly weapons to fight with. Explore as many dungeons as you can before you get killed!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/14956fb67fb6a24c555cb52fe4df7e1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shockwire"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
