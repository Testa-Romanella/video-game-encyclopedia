Even in death he threatens to take the lives of any who wander too close to his final resting place.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>That's exactly why walking straight into his home is usually a terrible idea. Thankfully even warlocks of great eldritch power can be out of their league, sometimes.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n<p><em><strong>A Colour Like No Other</strong></em> is a story about expression, vulnerability, and shared burdens. It's about trying to help the people you love, even if you're 99% sure it isn't necessary.</p>\n<p>It's also about those things happening in the context of the horror movie unfolding around you. It's okay, though; you're much scarier.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ce/0ce5fa0076b57b6ac2faad5fbce4c2c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TheNamelessOne"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
