{"id": 146307, "slug": "big-palladium", "name": "Big Palladium", "name_original": "Big Palladium", "description": "<p>A short video boardgame (playtime ~5-10 minutes) with an emphasis on risk management for 1 - 4 players.</p>\n<p>Palladium is the most fluctuating metal on the market</p>\n<p>Wollahyde, a cunning businessman, insists the right prediction will \r\nmake it big. He gives you a loan, and wants as much Palladium as \r\npossible, as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Fluctuating Markets</p>\n<p>Each go around the board will see the market in different conditions \r\n-- it may be booming, or tanking. You won't know until AFTER you invest \r\nin Palladium Blocks, or PdB. Not to worry, however -- you are given the \r\noption to arm yourself with weapons against the unpredictability of the \r\nmarket.</p>\n<p>Calls, Puts</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game (or later if you are very lucky) you are\r\n given the option to buy a Call or Put contract. While you may be able \r\nto invest in fewer PdB, Calls and/or Puts can offer you peace of mind \r\namidst a wild market. Calls ensure you'll never have to buy future PdB \r\nat a price higher than the contract states, and Puts ensure you'll never\r\n have to sell your PdB for less than a certain rate. Choose wisely -- \r\nplay too safe and you won't win big, but play too risky and you may lose\r\n it all.</p>\n<p>Interest</p>\n<p>Think the PdB market is going to be garbage for awhile? Why not hold \r\nonto your cash? You'll make interest on your account at the start of \r\neach turn. It's a small but constant cash flow -- and it matters more \r\nthe more cash you have stored away.</p>\n<p>Annuities</p>\n<p>Once you reach the end of the board your assets will be liquidated \r\nand used to buy PdB at the price the market at that space will buy it \r\nfor. At that point, you have two choices: stop right there and be \r\ncontent with what you have, or make a final wager. For a decent chunk of\r\n your hard-earned PdB, you can buy an Annuities contract -- you'll be \r\npaid a certain percentage of your PdB, in PdB, for every turn your \r\nopponents don't reach the end. Put some pressure on the competition and \r\ncash in on your high rolls!</p>\n\n<p>Check out the Soundtrack!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f3/8f36b254ed1a1a0b121421f986cd9d58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WaveParadigm"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
