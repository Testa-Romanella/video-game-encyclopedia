Astronaut Alone is a beautiful 2D Platform tackling the themes of isolation and regret with a story told out of order through lost letters. In this game, the player is able to jump midair whenever they want, but limited in jumps by their fuel gauge, forcing players to conserve resources and think carefully about how they traverse a level.</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Space: Jetpack</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: Move</p>\n<p>Z: Reset Level</p>\n<p>M: Return to Main Menu<br/></p>\n\n<p>Background Theme:<br/></p>\n<p>New Direction by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4120-new-direction<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T04:56:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e8/9e86f7963a78433bf5c7b9c4edf7c6c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casey Jarmes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
