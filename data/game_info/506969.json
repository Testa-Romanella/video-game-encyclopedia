It is a first person shooter where the player has to shoot multiple boxes to earn points or increase his time.\u00a0 The thrill in this game comes from the fact that the player has limited time to score as many points as possible, but if he tries to be aggressive in his attempt for gathering point or time bonus he is more likely to fail as the game automatically learns his strategy and adjusts itself accordingly.\u00a0This will require a mouse and keyboard to play, it is supported on any version of windows above XP.\u00a0 \u00a0Please do provide your feedback in the community section</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:09:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/289/2897d961632adcf1180d33c8b0d394d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anarchy Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
