Racing with stunts by car.", "description": "<p>\u00a0 </p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>The game is a car simulator with a view from the cab.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0In this fascinating game you have to drive along the various routes laid along ramps without fences for the minimum time. Be ready to overcome sharp turns, jumps and dead loops, go around swaying hammers and other difficult obstacles.\u00a0</strong><br/>To confidently overcome all the elements of the tracks you will need to gain some experience and understand how the car behaves on different parts of the road. Therefore, be persistent and analyze the mistakes you made.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0For each race you will be credited with coins, the faster you overcome the track, the more coins you will receive. In addition, you can collect prize coins in the process of movement on the highway. All the coins you receive can be spent on upgrading your car or opening a new racetrack.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Car Upgrade:\u00a0</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0When upgrading your car, observe a reasonable balance between the installed components, controllability and stability of your car depends on it. For example, after installing a powerful engine you can reach great speed and show better race time. But if you leave the tires with a small coefficient of adhesion, then drifting is guaranteed on turns, and the soft suspension can not keep the car from a large roll and the car will turn over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Driving on the highway:\u00a0</strong><br/>\u00a0 When driving on the highway, pay attention to the signs and if necessary, follow the recommended speed.<br/>\u00a0 Do not brake sharply when cornering, this may lead to a car drift and fall from the overpass.<br/>\u00a0 When overcoming the springboards, try to move with acceleration at the moment of separation. This will make the flight more even. Do not slow down in any way.<br/>\u00a0 When overcoming the loop of death, drive into the loop at a speed of at least 100 km / h. Try to move coasting and do not perform sharp maneuvering.<br/>\u00a0 Remember that the car in the game behaves quite realistic. Therefore, in the case of an accident, try to analyze the situation, understand the reason and repeat the race. Practice, experiment, improve your driving skills and be sure you will succeed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Driving a car:\u00a0</strong><br/>\u00a0 To control the car's turns, use the accelerometer of your device. In the settings menu, you can select the control sensitivity that is most convenient for you.<br/>\u00a0 For backward movement, it is necessary to simultaneously hold down the brake and gas pedals.</p>\n<p>The game is regularly updated and supplemented with new tracks. Try to go through all the race tracks in turn, this will allow you to gain the skills necessary to travel along the following tracks.<br/>\u00a0 Please do not forget to leave your feedback and suggestions for further development of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T05:17:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06b/06b3a1a57f3b17714cd102ee228378d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leonid1964"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
