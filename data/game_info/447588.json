So when you re-play a level with the exact same settings and moves you get the same results, over and over again.</p><p>I want to create a \"clean art\" / minimalistic and smooth Match3 game without overloading effects and such. Also I'm learning some basic art skills on the way. Graphics are done by myself. As a typical technical software engineer it's not an easy task for me, but trying my best.</p><p>When all mechanics are implemented, the game will be released for iOS and Android.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Procedural level generation</li><li>Bombs when matching 4 or more pieces (row, column, area T or L shapes)</li><li>Simple stage system (10 levels per stage)</li></ul><p><strong>In Planing</strong></p><ul><li>Color Bomb</li><li>Tile blocker</li><li>More goals</li><li>More limits</li><li>Enhance graphics</li><li>Booster / Powers (destroy a block, destroy specific color on screen)</li><li>Endurance / Life system (loosing hearts when loosing a game)</li><li>Rewards (finishing a stage)</li><li>... more</li></ul><p>Please leave a comment with some valuable feedback.
