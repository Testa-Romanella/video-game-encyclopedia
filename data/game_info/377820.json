Fling your way across dozens of levels with your trusty gatling gun of doom. Try your best not to die, but believe me, you are going to be dying.<h3>Gameplay</h3>You live, you die, you live again. In Gatlin', your main methods of problem solving are your eyes and learning from your mistakes. Upon dying, you are sent back to the start of the level to run through it again until you do it right.<br/><br/><br/>I hear you asking, \"What causes me to die?\" That is an oddly-morbid question, but a question I will answer nonetheless. You'll die to classical art, you'll die to spikes, you'll die to weird demented clones, and you'll die to tears. By the way, that last thing is both figurative and literal.<h3>Boss Fights</h3>The boss fights in Gatlin' are sentient bullet hells gone rogue. Fear not! They have patterns and tricks that you will likely get accustomed to.<br/><br/><br/>Each boss also reveals  <strong>c</strong> <strong>r</strong> <strong>i</strong> <strong>s</strong> <strong>p</strong> <strong>y</strong>  lore and each boss harbors an unforgettable personality - so that's pretty neat I guess.<h3>Endgame</h3>The endgame of Gatlin' is a distinctive twist on the existing gameplay. After the conclusion of the main story, <strong>level modifiers</strong> and <strong>endgame worlds</strong> are unlocked. Want levels to be more difficult? We've got you covered. Imagine Hell itself. Good work. Now imagine Hell without gravity and now every surface is covered in soap. Get the picture?<br/><br/>Does Hell not sound appealing enough for you? Understandable, everyone's a critic. Instead, <strong>we offer a wide array of eccentric and ever-expanding levels, worlds, and challenges to partake in.</strong><h3>Speedrunning</h3>Gatlin' was and will always be designed with all types of player in mind. If you wish to go slow or fast, the level design panders to all. That said, <strong>we highly encourage speedrunning</strong>.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T02:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de87561412717f69af3e71696504dd84.jpg", "website": "https://dotcopycat.com/projects.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["dotcopycat"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["dotcopycat"], "esrb_rating": null}
