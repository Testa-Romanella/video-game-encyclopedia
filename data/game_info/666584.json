The main goal is to farm pumpkins and protect the crops from evil beings using your tools and resources around.</p>\n<p>MYTH/ LEGEND (Limitation): A long time ago in Ireland, they used to place harvested pumpkins, well-known as Jack O' Lanterns, to scare evil creatures from their crops when the date of Halloween was approaching.</p>\n<p>To do it a bit more challenging, I limited myself only to use an 8 color palette and an 8x8 canvas.</p>\n<p>Please, feel free to comment what you've liked and disliked about the game or any bugs you found, all the reviews are appreciated!!
