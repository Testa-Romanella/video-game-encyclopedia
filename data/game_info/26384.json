It's up to Kirby to get it back and ultimately save Popstar from \n      being taken over! Our round, pink hero will have to journey through six \n      main games and two minigames, finishing with the ultimate showdown in \n      the Arena. Each game offers its own story and variation of platforming \n      action, as well as unique environments and an assortment of enemies. \n      Swallowing an enemy allows Kirby to copy the abilities of that enemy, \n      granting him the power to perform special attacks and giving him a new \n      hat to don. Kirby can also give up an acquired ability and use it to \n      create a helper. The helper will follow Kirby around and automatically \n      fight as his ally\u2014or offer a second player the chance to join in the \n      game by controlling it. There's never a dull moment as Kirby dashes, \n      flies, and fights!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
