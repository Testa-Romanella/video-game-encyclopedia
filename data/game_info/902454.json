More content will be released regularly.</strong></p>\n<p>A 2D retro-style pixelated tower defense inspired by the elements! Fight with your towers to fend off the oncoming waves of monsters and defend your lands.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play + Controls</strong></p>\n<p>I haven't gotten to make a controls screen or tutorial, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>Menus can be navigated using mouse or keyboard, but gameplay is strictly mouse-interactive. If you're a first-timer to Tower Defense, no worries!</p>\n<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Survive continuous waves of enemies by placing towers on the map and upgrading them to strengthen them. You lose lives if the monsters reach the end. Live through 30 waves so you can see the You Win! screen at the end!</p>\n<p>All selecting and button clicking is with the left-click.</p>\n<p>To deselect a tower, use the right-click anywhere on the screen.</p>\n<p>What you get with the current build:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three unique towers: Zephyr, Druid, Phoenix</li>\n<li>Four different enemies</li>\n<li>30 playable waves</li>\n<li>A single map :')</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But here's what you can expect in future updates!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A total of eight towers!</li>\n<li>A (hopefully) endless gameplay system</li>\n<li>A wide assortment of monsters</li>\n<li>More maps to play on</li>\n<li>A more advanced upgrade system, with more powerful tower evolutions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And much more!</p>\n<p>Please do give Elementals TD a shot, and let me know what you think! Feedback or criticism will always be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Feel free to take a look at the dev logs if you want to see a timeline of me ranting during the process of developing this. Maybe I should have made podcast recordings while working on this, but who wants to listen to me complaining about how straightforward things\u00a0<em>aren't</em> for hours on end, right?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T10:39:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/379/379bcead205e8152d286258229b22a06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scarletrazer"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
