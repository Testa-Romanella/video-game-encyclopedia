So we decided to remove the guessing.<br/><br/>Mineswifter uses an advanced Minesweeper AI to make sure each board is solvable before giving it to you. This lets you skip the nonsense and SWIFTLY go to the boards you actually wanted to play.<br/><br/>PERFECTLY NATURAL<br/><br/>Mineswifter is designed with a modern and beautiful user interface. Customize everything from the background colors to your play style to make the game work exactly the way you want. Works great with split-screen and a mouse on iPad!<br/><br/>REAL HINTS<br/><br/>Every board is solvable, but not every board is easy. That's why we added a hint system that uses the power of the Minesweeper AI to show you exactly which part of the board is solvable next.<br/><br/>UNDO YOUR MISTAKES<br/><br/>Accidentally click on a mine? No problem! Since every board is solvable, there are no game overs \u2013 simply click the Undo popover and keep playing.<br/><br/>STAT TRACKING<br/><br/>The main stat tracked in Mineswifter is the perfect game, which is a board completed without mistakes or hints. Try to beat your longest perfect streak or your average time!<br/><br/>DAILY CHALLENGES<br/><br/>Mineswifter also offers daily challenges, which can generally be completed within a few minutes. Check the stats to compare your mine sweeping performance to players from around the world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T02:39:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0b4b72018a49d6356cedcc0f80b7d12_v3e6FGz.jpg", "website": "https://bonzaiapps.com/mineswifter/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bonzai Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Michael McFadden"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
