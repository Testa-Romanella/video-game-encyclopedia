It was built haltingly over about a year and a half using some tools I know well &amp; others I barely understand.<br/><br/>I was inspired throughout by the small but resilient community of people using Gamemaker: Studio for 3D development. Like any commercial framework, GM:S has its caveats, but I appreciate its primordial, open-ended toolset, and I hope this game can be a small but interesting contribution to the scene.<br/><br/>More than anything, I hope it weirds you out for a little while, and maybe offers a bit of respite from grimly uncertain times.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T08:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ce8ee47a3cfe1ddede6a4a0eb374033.jpg", "website": "https://www.whosewoods.org", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hexcavator"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["hexcavator"], "esrb_rating": null}
