Osiris deposits his seed in several places in a palace after participating in a party full of sex.<br/>The truth is that the lovers who had sex with him kept his seed in pots that are now scattered around the place.<br/>Pornocrates wants to take possession of that seed. She creates wonders by manipulating the bodily fluids of men and women.<br/>There is a gigantic creative universe behind Pornocrates. She runs a gigantic simulator that reconstructs several idyllic worlds. Now we will travel to ancient Egypt.  We will travel centuries into the past, facing elusive mummies and demons. Let's try out other facets of Queen Pornocrates.<br/>\"This game is based on F\u00e9licien Rops's painting: A woman in profile, haughty, dressed only in black stockings adorned with a vertical row of pink and red flowers, held up by blue garters, long black gloves, golden bracelets, a wide golden belt with a big blue bow, a blue necklace, blue earrings, a black feathered hat, two white roses in her hair and a white veil headband. The woman can be seen as a powerful female and your hog. The pig with a golden tail can also be seen as an allegory for luxury.\"<br/><strong>\"Pornography is purely and simply a description of carnal pleasures; eroticism is the same revalued description, based on an idea of love or social life. Everything that is erotic is also necessarily pornographic\"</strong> ~ Self-definition of Queen Pornocrates.<br/><br/>The game is in the first person. The player is introduced to a world similar to the real world of the past. This is one of the many worlds created by Pornocrates to satisfy his pleasure.<br/>However, there is an intruder controlling this world: Osiris.<br/>It is unknown if he is an avatar of some hacker or other entity. What is known is that Osiris hides something that Pornocrates needs to recover. The player needs to collect 5 (or six) flaming scarabs to activate the portal that will take them to a secret chamber inside the pyramid. To succeed in this challenge, the player will need to face the creatures that protect the scarabs, in addition to dealing with the traps that will arise. Navigate using the keyboard (WASD) and Mouse.
