As such, the file is very big and\u00a0there are quite a few bugs that at the time I wasn't capable of correcting, so apologies in advance!! I will likely continue this project in the future and hopefully put together something a little more refined. Until then, here's a prologue of sorts to introduce you to this little world of mine:</p>\n<p>-- Prologue --</p>\n<p>Set against the backdrop of an ancient war, the soul of a nameless knight seeks to restore the broken cycle of life and death.</p>\n<p>No one remembers why, but upon its destruction, the world burnt on its anvil and set light to the Dawn of Ember, releasing the Abyss. As darkness spread, it brought with it both a semblance of death, and an aggressive corruption that twisted the souls it encountered beyond repair. Those strong enough to resist either became monsters or fled the curse by stealing stronger husks. Whereas they that perished were reduced to ash, the last flickering flames of their souls tormenting into whimsical Emberlights.</p>\n<p>Now the world is wrought with painful violence. Its sun shattered and its lands smouldered. The key to ending the otherwise eternal age of Ember lies in purging the Great Kingdoms of their curses, driving back the darkness and sealing the Abyss. However, to do so, our hero must consume all ten of the Atheling Souls imbued by the Abyss with Darkling Emberlights...</p>\n<p>Without losing themselves to the curse...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:05:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/130/13032d530419a3dd7f7d0e2fd6e57663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kyle Fitzpatrick"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
