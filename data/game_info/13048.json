Just a few hours ago I was a baker in San Antonio, Texas, who was working hard to give his daughter everything she needed. I am a single father, my wife Rosa died 15 years ago. Those tyrants from the organisation named Kiminster Laboratories killed her. They are the same ones who have kidnapped me and my little child, Elise.
