But.. Why did they send a fat, blue, grumpy blob into space? TO COLLECT STARS!! HE MUST CAT-LECT EM' ALL!!</p>\n<p><em>(tiny-tip: at first aim for as many stars as possible instead of them all)</em></p>\r\nBehind The Scenes\r\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by the Famicom Home-Brew of RIKI. During the initial dev period I found their work very interesting and wanted to make something similar... AND NOW HERE WE ARE!!! Star-Cat took the longest to make out of any of my games. And, as naive as it sounds, has cemented to me that this is my life's cause. I thank you all for playing, and look forward to reading your reviews, comments, and or questions!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Design/Art/Code/Sound:\u00a0@MarinaMakes</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Packbat &amp;\u00a0@MarinaMakes</p>\n<p>Translation:\u00a0\u00a0Yasuhito</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T09:47:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb7/bb7ef31a423534269b79111b6680a796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marina"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
