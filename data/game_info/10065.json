{"id": 10065, "slug": "cities-skylines", "name": "Cities: Skylines", "name_original": "Cities: Skylines", "description": "<p>Cities: Skylines is a traditional city-building game, which allows players to experience urban planning in all aspects including zoning, road placement, transportation, taxation, and improvement of welfare. Therefore, within the game players are able to assume roles of city\u2019s principal architect and mayor. The history of the city, in control of the player, begins with the 2-by-2 kilometers plot of land and a sum of money to start with. Players have to zone the city, build roads, explore the surroundings, provide infrastructure and jobs to attract new citizens. Once the newcomers settle down, the immediate reaction is expected to establish public services and to set proper taxes. Progressing within the game and developing the city will unlock new upgrades of the urban environment and lead to the territorial expansion. The gameplay also requires the control of several city\u2019s parameter scales like budget, health, employment, and pollution. The game also features a creative sandbox mode, where the architect\u2019s imagination is not restricted in any way.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2015-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T19:53:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/25c/25c4776ab5723d5d735d8bf617ca12d9.jpg", "website": "http://www.citiesskylines.com/", "rating": 4.12, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 387, "owned": 6098, "beaten": 484, "toplay": 125, "dropped": 790, "playing": 271}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 471, "ratings_count": 1461, "suggestions_count": 429, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1471, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Colossal Order"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Paradox Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
