Arafinn is a dark high-fantasy world full of epic tales and legends. The kontor gets expanded over time and will be enhanced with new features and experiences.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"In times when the gods wandered among men and shaped Ar\u00e0's surface, light and darkness were in perfect balance; the kingdoms of men and dwarves from the coldest north to the deepest south living together in peace with the elven cultures in the west, and even with the obscure dark elves in the distant east. People were free and had everything to live a good life; neither they knew war nor misery. <br/><br/>But, yes - the time of peace and harmony could not last forever. A\u017cgord\u00e0r, the god of wrath and deception, brought the balance in sway as he betrayed his own siblings. And so it began; the ancient foundations of divine equilibrium broke, and bitterness and immorality found their way to the heart of men. Where hatred and bitterness triumph, inequality and war are not far away. And so, he will rise from the abyss to divide brothers and sisters, promising gold but bringing the sword. Therefore, see and behold, disease and death follow in his shadow.\" <br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore the different ages, gods, creatures and flora, and the legends and tales of Arafinn.
