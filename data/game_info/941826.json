This game is currently in development and the future for this is currently unknown. Although I am interested in implementing more features to it such as more mechanics, design changes, creating my own assets for it and making it a much more honed game. But we shall see.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the first prototype of the game and if you would like to support me, you are more than welcome to donate any amount of money that you wish. There will be many more prototypes to come in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T11:13:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc6d41d9b5749d2871c65fc268fdc5a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hitborn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
