But the universe had other plans for him.\"</em><br/></p>\n<p>This si an entry for the\u00a0Summer Slow Jams August 2020: Horror Games\u00a0from\u00a0@feilyn and me.</p>\n<p>The style is <strong>OBVIOUSLY inspired by Don't Starve</strong>. We wanted to play with the 2D-on-3D effect a little. Also the story is an homage to the classic \"<em>The Colour Out of Space</em><em>\"</em> by H.P. Lovecraft.</p>\n<p>It was a <strong>first collaboration</strong> for Feilyn and me (and, let's be frank, one of the rare collaboration from me with anyone to be honest), \u00a0so the project ended<em> a little bit less complete that hoped</em>, by the fact that we had to learn how to work on the fly (and also because it was made while having a brand new day-job which is never an easy period of life).</p>\n<p>This game will probably get another version soon. But for now, for the jam, this version will do :p.</p>\n<p>Instruction and how to play are in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T02:34:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f9/0f932bce566a0790fcac7e8dd4dfb903.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Captain Nakou"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
