{"id": 813955, "slug": "out-of-breath-demo", "name": "Out Of Breath - Demo", "name_original": "Out Of Breath - Demo", "description": "<p>Out of Breath is a psychological-horror game that uses biofeedback to create a more immersive experience. The player takes the role of an underwater explorer trapped in a cave without an oxygen supply. Explore to find your way out, and uncover the truth abou some ancient evil lurking down there. It's in development for PC and will be integrated to wearable devices for measuring the heart rate in real time.</p>\n<p>HOW TO CONNECT MY WEARABLE DEVICE:</p>\n<p>In order to have the full experience designed for the game, we ask you to be wearing a device compatible with the Hyperate plugin. You can see a list of supported devices here:\u00a0https://www.hyperate.io/supported-devices.<br/>To connect it with the game, you'll need to download the Hyperate app, available for Android and IOS. Alternatively, you can connect through web bluetooth on the following link:\u00a0https://www.hyperate.io/webbluetooth. Either way, be sure to note down your Hyperate ID (e.g.:\u00a0q1GOlZt). Once the game launches, you'll be asked to enter this ID to connect with your device.</p><p>HOW TO PLAY WITHOUT A WEARABLE DEVICE:</p><p>If you don't have access to a wearable device, you can enter \"internal-testing\" in the Hyperate ID field. Doing so will simulate the measuring of the heart rate for the session.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T08:21:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/470/4702703b0a17699f0c78c1204dfe58d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jordyRG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
