Save the helpless and dull-witted campers from an onslaught of monsters with a team of counselors, each with a special power.</p>\n<p>Players are tasked with controlling a group of four counselors on a mission to save the campers from the horrors that lurk in the night, and the camp from a series of unfortunate wrongful death lawsuits.</p>\n<p>Camp Keepalive's gameplay focuses on strategic decision-making, where player must always think a few turns ahead and where one wrong move can lead to a sudden reduction in staff... With twenty levels, eight counselors each with special abilities, and a free-play \"Keepalive\" mode, Camp Keepalive has plenty of challenge to keep make this a summer to remember...</p>\r\nThe demo provides an endless onslaught of top-down terror, as shamblers shamble and werewolves devour every last child. The theme is strong and the variety of monster behaviour makes for compelling tactical decisions. I hunger for more.\r\n<p>Rock Paper Shotgun</p>\r\nQuite unassuming upon first glance, this Twofold Secret creation is a very pleasant surprise that is bound to have you breaking camp time and time again.\r\n<p>StrategyCore</p>\r\nI laughed aloud twice during the brief tutorial, and while that's not always a good thing when it comes to a horror-themed game, the well-crafted strategy elements ensure that players will still be on the edge of their seats while playing \u2014 even if they're laughing in the process.\r\n<p>Gamezebo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b5/0b5defaa71020a6bd528902dbf83ffb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Twofold Secret"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
