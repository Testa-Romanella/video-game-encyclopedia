What did it stand on? An even bigger turtle, which stood on an even larger one. It was turtles all the way down!</em><br/></p>\n<p>In this VR game, stack turtles upon one another, as the gigantic \"world turtle\" beneath them all walks along rugged terrain. Don't let any turtles fall off beneath the world turtle!</p>\n<p>Requires an Oculus Quest / Quest 2 or a desktop VR system (SteamVR, Oculus desktop, and Windows Mixed Reality).<br/></p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 49 in &lt;72 hours.
