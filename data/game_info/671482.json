And somebody is at the door that wants to speak with you. Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around. Press space to open the shades, close the windows, and open or close the door. And there are many more interesting shockers in this game. Anyways it's a pretty-nice game which I spent some time working on.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T05:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e65a0f9012b9990f0ff5e4fa1968260.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joe Capo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
