Once you've constructed a die, you can install upgrades on it the same way.</p>\n<p>Hover a die to roll it (no clicking required!)</p>\n<p>All of the build commands are bound to the keyboard, left to right: Q, W, E, R, T, and so on. This will feel very natural on American Qwerty keyboards... but probably no one else. Sorry.</p>\n<p>As you progress the camera will zoom out and reveal more build sites for you to construct dice on. Don't forget to sell your lesser dice and replace them with better dice. I\u00a0hear the rare Cosmic Die can send you into another universe... it can also roll a 7.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:14:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44fc246f2b7371cf0b91b9a114dae893.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["quarkimo", "NotExplosive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
