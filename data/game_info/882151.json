The themes were Verticality and Non-Violence, so I opted to get out of my comfort zone and design a short platformer level.</p>\n<p>One of my goals for this jam was familiarize myself with the basics of the Unity engine, and I made use of the free asset \"3D Game Kit\" to allow me to build the level with existing mechanics already implemented. Hope you enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T15:43:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/338/33810d58e56de8833d67b74554550ecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artovis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
