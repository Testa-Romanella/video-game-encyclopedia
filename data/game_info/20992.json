It\u2019s achieved either through building a game with a constant threat to all players or if it\u2019s a game mode that adds horror elements or atmosphere to already existing multiplayer game. Originally developed as a Half-Life mod, Cry of Fear is a free-to-play horror game, that has single-player and multiplayer modes. Players take control of Simon Henriksson that finds himself after a car accident in a dark city overrun by monsters. Now Simon has to explore the city and find the source of the evil.<br />\nThis take on a psychological horror introduces several mechanics in order to make the gameplay challenging, Cry of Fear can be played in single-player and multiplayer with three other players, which doesn\u2019t change the events of the campaign. Players have limited inventory space, only six slots to manage their healing items and weapons. But, characters are allowed to dual-wield items, meaning that player is capable of finding the combination of action items for specific game sections or specific team role players might take in multiplayer. Similarly to Silent Hill series, in order to progress players will have to solve puzzles while city swaps between \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cnightmare\u201d modes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e06/e062facadfeb0a0339103bf7e81ca129.jpg", "website": "http://www.cry-of-fear.com", "rating": 3.55, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 168, "owned": 2492, "beaten": 187, "toplay": 37, "dropped": 151, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 314, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 321, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Psykskallar"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Psykskallar"], "esrb_rating": null}
