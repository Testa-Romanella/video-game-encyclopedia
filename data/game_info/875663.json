It is a special version of Pepe's Epic Adventure where Pepe gets stuck in the backrooms, is it even possible to escape? I think my game is actually hard enough already, so there's only 1 level, if someone somehow wins I'll prolly update the game with the extra layers, a total of 5 were planned.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls are listed ingame.<br/></strong></p>\n\r\nAttributions\r\nDevelopment\r\n<ul><li>CyberRobotnix</li></ul>\r\nSound effects\r\n<ul><li>Dan Knoflicek</li><li>CyberRobotnix</li></ul>\n<p>See also Pepe's Epic Adventure attributions if I'm missing anyone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T14:16:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a4/8a43f5772fa50d14d0c948dd648fc3fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CyberRobotnix"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
