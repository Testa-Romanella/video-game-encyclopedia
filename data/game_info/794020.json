The player tries to reach the end as fast as possible, while potentially also collecting all the coins.</p>\n<p>For doing so, you will have a super power : you can teleport yourself in a parallel dimension, allowing you to move across a whole multiverse. Master your skills, and you will be able to reach your destination and beat your score !</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A : Left<br/>D : Right<br/>Space : Climb ladder<br/>Left Shift : Go down on ladder<br/>Space : Jump<br/>E : Teleport to the same place in the\u00a0other dimension</p>\n<p><strong>Tip :</strong></p>\n<p>Some times, you will need to time your teleportations... When falling, the torches might help you a bit. Or they may not. I'm not sure.<br/></p>\n<p>If you really are stuck, you can download the\u00a0solution video under the Download section. You will however need to find the path for all the coins by yourself :)</p>\n<p><strong>Current best score : 3045</strong>\u00a0 - (Please tell us if you can do better ;) ) (Discord:\u00a0.jpeg#7169, \u039b2#6699,\u00a0Lord_Tigrou#2391)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Pictures:</strong></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Art C</strong><strong>redits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Character sprite and animations by MiMU Studio<br/>(https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/2d-hd-druid-graphic-animatio...)</li><li>Music composed and performed\u00a0by Thibault (Lord_Tigrou#2391)</li><li>Torches animations and minecarts by Lem (https://www.deviantart.com/his0kaeya)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T08:05:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/4126d8b44864566147c27655611ff11c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["mjpeg", "Utorque", "Graalln"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
