{"id": 466944, "slug": "stellar-renegades", "name": "Stellar Renegades", "name_original": "Stellar Renegades", "description": "<p>Stellar Renegades is a sci-fi western otome set in the far distant future where humanity has flung itself to the stars. You play as the captain of a motley crew of con men, thieves, and rebels trying to scrape by any means possible in a universe that has no place for outlaws. Lie, cheat, and steal your way through the universe, and maybe into the heart of your crew.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Download is the Demo only, routes will be released on a chapter by chapter basis, per character. First two set to start a rolling release are Rhett and JD. Other routes to follow!</p>\n\n<br/>Rhett, stoic solider\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>Rhett has stood by your side for over a decade. Steadfast and calm, he\u2019s the perfect second-in-command. A good soldier, a better friend, and despite his intimidating looks, a total marshmallow. He's had a crush on you for over a decade, but he's always been too shy to act on it. Maybe now's the time to finally give him the push he needs to take a risk or two.</p>\r\nJD, loud-mouthed mechanic\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>A smart-mouthed playboy that propositions you at every turn. As a gifted mechanic, he\u2019s a vital part of your crew, no matter how aggravating. JD rarely takes anything seriously, apart from upgrades to the ship. His easy wit and charming demeanor make you want to learn more, but it's hard to take his over-the-top flirting seriously and it feels like he's just messing with you. Unless, he actually\u00a0<em>means</em>\u00a0what he says?</p>\r\nMorgan, hot-headed chef\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>The ship's chef is quite possibly the only capable crew member. Morgan can shoot, steal, hack, pilot, and do generally anything you need him to, but he chooses to cook. That doesn't stop the crew from treating him with more respect than they give you, though. He says he's retired, but no one has any idea what he actually retired from. And the more you try to find out, the more he tries to push you away.</p>\r\nLex, feisty ace pilot\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>Never one to mince words, Lex is the best pilot in the universe and wants everyone to know it. Snubbed by both the Dominion forces and the Republic alliance, Lex has offered you her piloting skills, at a cost: she wants to take your spot. To her, being captain means having the best skills, and she's got that in spades. But maybe her 'rivalry' with you is really just her way of trying to get to know you better?</p>\r\nCaspian, sarcastic doctor\u00a0\r\n<p>Cold, calculating, cynical. Those three words sum up the talented ship\u2019s doctor Caspian. At least, that's what he wants you to think. Too bad he keeps slipping up and showing how much he really cares about the crew, and especially you. With a checkered past and some bad decisions still haunting him, it seems being part of your crew is just about the only thing keeping Caspian grounded right now.</p>\r\nTeegan, naive android\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>Or, Tactical Ground Operation Unit Number 9820693681. A fully functional Archon android, they're basically a walking miracle. No one else has had the technology to make such a thing for over two thousand years. They find themselves awake and stranded in a land they don't understand, where everything they've known is gone. Programmed to learn and adjust, they tentatively join your crew to try and carve out a space for themselves in this strange new world.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Creative director </strong>- Misszaius<br/><strong>Sprite and CG Art</strong> - Remnantation<br/><strong>Background Art</strong> - Keira, Foxeleos<br/><strong>Editors</strong> - Cirro, tatapb</p>\n\n<p>Stellar Renegades is currently in development, with routes to be released on a chapter by chapter basis for patrons.
