Beat your high scores and try to achieve the 3 stars.</strong> SPEEDRUNNER is a game for those who are in for a challenge and like to move fast, meanwhile the ones who enjoys to jump around on platforms while listening to music will probably have a good time too. <br/>The Speedrunner (you) will be sprinting in a first person view, looking for the fastest way to reach the finish line. On the way there you might stumble across chests which contains customizable items for your player. There are several mechanics that you should keep track of. By running in a north-east/-west local direction will speed you up and by letting go of \"w\" or \"^\" will ruin your tempo. And as you should know, tempo is everything in this game.<br/>In the tutorial mode you will learn all the mechanics and it is also possible to work on your skills inside the practice area.
