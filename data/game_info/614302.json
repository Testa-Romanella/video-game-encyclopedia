Made for the 2021 'So Bad It's Good' Jam.</p>\n<p>https://11belowstudio.itch.io/inconvenient-space-rocks-2</p>\n<p>https://github.com/11BelowStudio/SBIG-2021</p>\n<p>This is a mutliplayer game. But don't worry, you can play it by yourself. Just open the game four times, click on</p>\n<p>'host game' on the main menu for one of them, and click 'join game' on the other three opened games. Click the 'ready' <br/>button on each game and congratulations, you are now playing with yourself! However, if you have friends, you can play <br/>with them over a LAN.</p>\n<p>Anyway, each player needs to hold space to move the spaceship in a direction. Each player can move the spaceship in one <br/>direction. So you'll need to cooperate to work out who's moving the ship in what direction and to actually move it.</p>\n<p>Dodge the Inconvenient Space Rocks that are in the way. Fly into the Cube That Allows You To Score Points to score <br/>points and recover hitpoints. And try not to die in a stupid and tragic way.</p>\n\n<p>(And if you encounter any bugs, let me know, and I'll attempt to fix them)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:37:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74f15e717d3cab373d3e2581733105bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["11BelowStudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
