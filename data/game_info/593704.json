Don't have any expectations, it was a bit of a fun experiment for me. It is just about the freedom of birds flying through endless nights, because during these flights you can get lost in the night and also in you mind. There is something special about being there in the endless skies. Maybe it will actually get you thinking, maybe not, there is only one way to figure it out.
