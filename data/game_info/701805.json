The theme was \"Just destroying stuff\".\u00a0Final dev time was 3:35. The majority of that time was spent scripting and building a menu system. I learned a lot about Unity's UI features and am happy with the results. I wasn't able to finish a combat system which was a little disappointing.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!<br/></p>\r\nAttributions\r\n<ul><li>Underworld Theme and Fanfare - Jocolloman</li><li>Menu System - Jocolloman</li><li>Scripting - Jocolloman</li><li>Map created with Captain Coder's Dungeoneering Kit</li></ul>\r\nTextures\r\n<ul><li>Wall Texture\u00a0-\u00a0rubberduck\u00a0</li><li>Floor Texture and Ceiling Texture\u00a0- Cethiel\u00a0</li><li>Granite,\u00a0Cherry Wood Veneer,\u00a0Pitted Rust- Textures from FreePBR.org</li></ul>\r\nSprites\r\n<ul><li>Weapon Sprites - Ravenmore</li><li>Armor Sprites - Zabin</li><li>Rest Sprite\u00a0-\u00a0J.W.
