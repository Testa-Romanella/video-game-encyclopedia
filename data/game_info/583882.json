Some had good\u00a0intentions of sharing the fabulous wealth. Whereas some had selfish\u00a0reasons of ambitious enrichment. Nevertheless, no matter the motives,\u00a0in the end, they found all the same fate. A long time has passed since\u00a0the last person was known to be seeking this cave. So long in fact, that\u00a0it was forgotten.</p>\n<p>So what happens when a Hitodama awakes to find itself lost in a\u00a0dark place? It\u2019s your job to help Hitodama find other lost souls\u00a0and help them. Some will be grateful for your aid, but others will\u00a0have twisted cores and evil intentions. Save as many as you can\u00a0and escape this cursed cave! Hitodama\u2019s peace depends on how\u00a0successful you are on this quest.</p>\n\n<p>----- CREDITS -----</p>\n<p>Font:\u00a0New Romantics - by\u00a0Jennifer Heinicke /\u00a0Fonts A Go-Go</p>\n<p>Audio:<br/>RescuingSouls - https://freesound.org/people/Kostas17/<br/>LastLostSouls -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/vitovsky1/<br/>IntangibiltitySkill - https://freesound.org/people/EminYILDIRIM/<br/>UndiscoveryHalls -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/copyc4t/<br/>BG-FX-sound.wav - https://freesound.org/people/Sclolex/<br/>BG-sound - https://freesound.org/people/julius_galla/<br/>Forest - https://freesound.org/people/Mrthenoronha/<br/>Menu\u00a0 \u00a0- https://freesound.org/people/Mrthenoronha/<br/>GoodEnding - https://freesound.org/people/StephieQueen/<br/>PickupGem - https://freesound.org/people/max2587/<br/>Windbell - https://freesound.org/people/Taira%20Komori/</p>\n<p>Sprites:<br/>Hitodama, Corrupted Souls, Lost Soul - @DavitMasia and @CodeManuPro\u00a0https://codemanu.itch.io/<br/>Nameless Cave -\u00a0Szadi art.\u00a0\u00a0https://szadiart.itch.io/<br/>Mysterious Forest -\u00a0Eder Muniz https://edermunizz.itch.io/<br/>FXs - ppeldo https://itch.io/profile/ppeldo<br/>Gems - https://free-game-assets.itch.io/<br/>Skeleton - Sanctum Pixel\u00a0\u00a0https://sanctumpixel.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T01:18:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da1/da1d88b89596be1ef25a2297434d2577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
