Combos, character positioning, kiting, etc, are the basic tactics you'll be using throughout the game. More than that, able to switch characters during combat is also one unique feature of this game. The game highlights fluid combat &amp; combo strikes. Every hero in this game has: 1 passive skill, 2 active skills, 1 evasion, &amp; 1 ultimate skill. The 3 gauge bars indicates character's HP, MP (for active skills), &amp; UC (full gauge to use ultimate skill). Also, certain characters/skills are designed for supportive usage, asisting DPS doing their job; long range vs. short range, physical atk vs. magical atk, AoE vs. single target, multi-hit vs. single burst, lots of combinations for you to find out. Every character is defined not only by his/her abilities &amp; skills, but also the hero attributes (stats). Including critical hit rates, there are more than 20 attributes that characterize each hero. You are able to bring 3 heroes to most stages, and total of 4 (including mercenary) to certain stages.</p> <p>HoD is a F2P, but not a P2W game as player level is the most important factor that decides how strong you can be, which is dependent on the EXP given from daily missions. You pay to get more resources for strengthening your heroes, but the choice is yours, since the free resources you get from the game are more than enough to power-up the 3 to 5 main heroes that will help you battle through every single game modes in HoD. And if you are inclined to train every single heroes in this game, leveling up your VIP level would be the quicker way to go.</p><p>HoD has more than 7 ways to power-up your heroes; each requires a certain amount &amp; types of resources. The game has more than 10 types of currency &amp; 100+ kinds of consumables. How to optimize your resource consumption is one of the most challenging things you will think about in this game.
