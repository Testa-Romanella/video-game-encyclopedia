Use your blocks as cover, as a shield, and even as a weapon to trap and kill in this action-puzzle game.\r\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD - Movement<br/>Space - Dash<br/>Left Mouse Button - Summon Tetromino<br/>Right Mouse Button - Rotate Tetromino<br/>Shift - Hold Piece<br/>E - Advance Dialogue<br/>Escape - Pause Menu</p>\n<p>*<strong>Tip*<br/></strong>Dashing into enemies allows your dash to reset faster.
