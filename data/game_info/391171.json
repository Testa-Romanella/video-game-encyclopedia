How long can you survive?</p>\n<p>This is a very basic game, it was made in 1 evening I had while at university so below 5 hours, I just thought it was a fun idea and would like to see what you guys think. I did name the game different to the project name in unity so the executable file has the name LetterSpeed.exe, where as I prefer \"Speed Letters\".</p>\n<p>Any feedback helps and please donate if you feel like it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for viewing this game, I hope you enjoy it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:09:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/ded6d89d172faca311f0828b2528629b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["khadenstudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
