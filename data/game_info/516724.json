I've played a lot of sports in my life, but bouldering, by far, takes the most endurance- both mental and physical. And Foddy games are... well... So naturally, I wanted to make something really difficult. I took the idea of GIRP (letter-based rock climbing) and added some elements that I've always wanted to throw into a rock-climbing system: a belay subsystem and environmental factors. I found the convergence of these elements really fun and exciting... but really challenging as well. I wasn't concerned with hyper-realism and instead wanted to maintain a more cartoony but recognizable\u00a0physics system.\u00a0<em>No Winter Maintenance</em>\u00a0is a short experience about endurance, so don't give up!</p>Keyboard<em>Click</em> and <em>hold</em> a rock's key to stay anchored OR click\u00a0a grapple rock's key once to attach and <em>click\u00a0</em>it once again to releaseLeft/Right ArrowsQuickly and repeatedly <em>click</em> to raise a loose arm (left arrow for left arm, right arrow for right arm)Up/Down Arrows<em>Click</em> to adjust rope length once grappled to a rockEscRestart the game<p>It's probably buggy, but it's a prototype!
