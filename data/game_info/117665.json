{"id": 117665, "slug": "boardungeon", "name": "Boardungeon", "name_original": "Boardungeon", "description": "<p>Boardungeon is a game for 2017's PROCJAM GameJam where I was inspired by the art pack provided by @devilsgarage. I wanted to make a board game rogue like where you would roll dice and explore a procedurally generated dungeon. You start only with the Warrior, but you can unlock three other classes and plenty of items as you go along, and ultimately you can even escape the dungeons!</p>\n<p>The game can be played with the WASD keys and the Spacebar or entirely with the mouse if you want. You collect gold and items, use spells, evade traps and defeat enemies. If you die, you can always start over, and the more gold you have, the more items you can find, so never lose hope and keep rolling that dice!</p>\n<p>Big thanks to @mcfunkypants for the procedural music generation. The music in this is way better than my old PROCJAM entry, Area 15:51:51</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e0/3e0fa8611cf30cd9f68b10e9217a5451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["poik007"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
