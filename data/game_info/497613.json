Then it was the matter of learning how to use\u00a0our game engine:\u00a0Godot, our art software: Aseprite, and all those little things that we hadn't considered until we got behind the curtain of game development.</p>\n<p>So, if you too have been wanting to make your own game, give it a shot! You'll probably enjoy the experience- just don't be afraid to watch a few\u00a0tutorials and get your foot in the door :).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks again for playing our game! Hopefully, the crows didn't spike you into the ground too hard... cue evil laugh</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>All art and music was created by us, for use in Fall.\u00a0 Some sound effects and our fonts were made using outside resources! Watch the credits in game to see the full list.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Benjamin from HeartBeast for your YouTube\u00a0 tutorials and inspiration!</p>\r\nFuture Plans:\r\n<p>We're now hooked on game dev and creating new experiences in our game! More hats, powerups, characters, etc.. are on the way. So,\u00a0Please share any bugs you may\u00a0find, as we do intend to continue developing this.\u00a0 Also, let us know if you have any ideas for new elements- we'll probably be just as excited about it as you!</p>\n<p>Playable doggo coming... sometime! :D</p>\r\nBugs:\r\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>The Spinny Cap allows players to fly outside the level</p>\n<p>- The crows' knockback seemingly ignores gravity &gt;:)</p>\n<p>- Performance issues in browser: try reloading the page after closing other tabs! If this doesn't work try our .exe\u00a0 for Windows!</p>\r\nFeature Requests:\r\n<p>- More levels!</p>\n<p>- Custom falling leaves shader!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T06:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ed/9ed79d4b71b8937addf7b9e9e905c491.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Studio Haiku"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
