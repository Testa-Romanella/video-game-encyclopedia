This leads to more difficult games, as you can't build the same mental tricks to solve where the mines are.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the grid is procedural and unique on each game.<br/><br/>The game opens on beginner mode, with a small grid. You can change the difficulty to intermediate or expert, which will create larger grid. You also have a custom mode, where you can go crazy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-26T08:00:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90d/90d72658c529692e6956d96898f1aa30.jpg", "website": "https://polyreplay.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Guillaume Fradin"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Guillaume Fradin"], "esrb_rating": null}
