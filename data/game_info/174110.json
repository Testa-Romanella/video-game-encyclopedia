Game requires DirectX 9 to run.</p><p>Predict your opponents moves in hotseat platformer deathmatch. Record your behaviour in plan phase and watch it being executed\u00a0simultanously with your opponents.</p>\n<p>The game goal is to collect as much crates as you can. You just need to collect at least one of each kind. Prevent your opponents from being there first. Shoot your rivals - when heroes are damaged then their moving and jumping abilities become lower. Immobilize them and dominate the game! But beware of wasting your ammo. Saved bullets strongly increase your regeneration.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>LEFT and RIGHT - movement<br/></p>\n<p>UP - jump</p>\n<p>W, S - aiming</p>\n<p>SPACE - shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4d/d4d219bf3c69abd01b6ba8ee13589cf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adach"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
