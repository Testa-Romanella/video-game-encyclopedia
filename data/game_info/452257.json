This requires the player to take a strategic approach to traversing the platforms ensuring that they have enough platforms left to make their return trip. Feed the Beast was created for the Cleveland Game Developer's month long game jam themed: Consume. The game is currently in its early prototype stages and plans to continue development are underway. We hope you enjoy our game and we look forward to creating more in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Laith Miller, Dan Wylie, Michael Elhage</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76b3272d974ecaae2e03087e2bdceba3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lmiller"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
