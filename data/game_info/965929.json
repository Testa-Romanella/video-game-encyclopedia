You arrive to this foreign land by steerage of a steamship, cramped with thousands of other immigrants, a stranger in a strange land, full of wonder. But you will soon discover that the city&#39;s beauty runs only skin-deep and all you find is rot beneath the golden facade.</p>\n<p>Dark smoke from the factories chokes the skies, segregation, inequality, and corruption run rampant. You will have to rise from the very bottom, make tough decisions, and get your hands dirty if you are to succeed - and you must, no matter the cost!</p>\n<p>Craft technopunk gear or master the arcane arts, fight, steal or smooth-talk your way to the top and become the hero or villain you want to be. You will not have to face the trials of this world alone, however; find your companions and gather your party, make foes and allies, fall in love, get involved in a massive conspiracy, and change the course of history forever.</p>\n<p>Will you rise to the occasion?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2023-09-08T05:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/565/56587d5d7ac1047438d44b87a95af4c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 457, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamate"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Fulqrum Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
