The witch, Muji, arrives to devour the ceaseless dreams. Switch between the real world and the dream world to traverse puzzles and acquire new spells to overcome increasingly difficult puzzles!</p>\n<p>This is my first coherent game project that was made for Godot Wild Jam #55, where the theme was Dreams. Since I am not an experienced programmer, I was not able to get the game to the completed state that was planned out, but I am happy with how far I came in the end. I will most likely update the game from time to time as the concept keeps expanding even after the initial planning.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T06:20:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e97/e977c2a51deae8e812adb7c1ffd99b70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["monkeymaniac"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
