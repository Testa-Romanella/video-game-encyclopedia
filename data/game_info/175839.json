So it's was made for Ludum dare 41, and this was the theme: \"Combine 2 Incompatible Genres\". Maybe you can't belive me, but this was harder than you think. Help \"Kiddo\" to use his abilities to reach the end in every test. There it's a history really deep down, but maybe in future version... if people like it. overall it's was really fun to do this, I enjoy the result. Feel free to coment a tell me what you think, it's gonna be appreciated. Keep in the flow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa9/aa95eb794a08dd64e3f5ed44c244ebf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kami'86"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
