Now, a week after your 23rd birthday, you return to the Place, and destroy it once it for all - only to be trapped again.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>All you need to do is make a series of certain action to put out the spell from the Place, and close the portal to another dimension.</p>\n<p>However, would you sacrifice your own humanity for the power of invincibility, or preserve everything what makes you a human being?<br/></p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Developer's commentary:<br/></p>\n<p>Finally get to make this under seven days. I was inspired by games that are known for their realism and difficulty such as\u00a0<em>Pathologic</em> and <em>KGB</em>. So I made the most difficult game I could think by using a premise based on these two game jams' themes. Then it got very difficult that I have to dial it down, and dropped some hints along the way.</p>\n<p>The game will randomly generate the main solution. You need to have a pen and paper lying around. But yous still can speedrun through this with a pure luck.</p>\n<p>If the browser is not working for you, then you could download them if you want. I use Linux desktop, but Windows seems used commonly among gamers.<br/></p>\n<p>If you are generous, please tip me at https://ko-fi.com/designergaze.<br/></p>\n<p>*****<br/></p>\n<p>This is an entry to <strong>Godot Wild\u00a0Jam\u00a023</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Weekly\u00a0Game\u00a0Jam 157.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Theme</strong>\u00a0for\u00a0this\u00a0month's\u00a0<strong>GWJ</strong>\u00a0is\u00a0<strong>'<em>Tiny\u00a0World</em>'</strong>.</p>\n<p>And the\u00a0<strong>Wildcards </strong>are:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Wherefore Art Thou? </em></strong>- Let the player name the protagonist!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dig it! </em></strong>- Feature destructible terrain in your game!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Seamless </strong></em>- Make your title screen be a part of the game itself!</p>\n<p>The <strong>Theme</strong> for this week's <strong>WGJ</strong> is '<strong><em>Vulnerable Invincible</em></strong>'.</p>\n<p>*****<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Planning and Coding:</strong> All by myself - @designergaze a.k.a.
