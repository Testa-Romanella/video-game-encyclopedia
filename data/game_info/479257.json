I've watched some of Brackey's tutorials on Youtube and when I\u00a0heard about this jam, I just took the leap forward!</p>\n<p>Given the theme \"rewind\", I've opted to go for the root of the word \"winding\" instead of the obvious rewinding of time mechanic. So, I've decided to create a simple game where you wind up a toy and given the amount of winding, the player is launched against several obstacles that must be avoided.</p>\n<p>I'm a complete nullity in graphics design, \u00a0so I've taken several free assets from several places and asked my good friend Carlos to draw a simple winding toy for the player. He ended up not having the time to animate it or to really improve it, so the result is just a simple draft sprite.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some game features:<br/></p>\n<p>- Random level generation. This includes the level, obstacles and terrain details.</p>\n<p>- Simple 2d physics</p>\n<p>- Some cool particle systems.</p>\n<p>- Nice audio effects.</p>\n<p>- Horrendous graphics with a\u00a0sort of a\u00a0Circus theme!</p>\n<p>Let me know if you wish to have a look at\u00a0the source code, I'll be happy to share it.<br/></p>\n<p>Music used:</p>\n<p>Circus Of Freaks by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5740-circus-of-freaks<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:05:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac5/ac56f6b5e521ff7e355a025b39111f49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JumpingBeaver"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
