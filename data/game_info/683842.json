The moves are carried out in turn. At the start of each turn, you restore 1 unit of mana. Accumulate more mana to cast more powerful spells or use potions for healing.

You can also skip your turn or burn an unwanted card to get a new one.</p>\n<p><em>This game was created during the training course \"Introduction to Video Games Creation\"\u00a0 from XAMK Open University.
