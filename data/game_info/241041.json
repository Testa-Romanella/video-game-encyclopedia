Utilizing the technological capabilities of the system, FM4 brings you the newest chapter in the best-selling series. While boasting an enhanced battle system, outstanding new graphics and dramatic voiceovers, FM4 maintains the strategic gameplay that has won acclaim from both gamers and press worldwide. As in the previous games, players can fully customize their wanzers, or mech units, with a variety of powerful weaponry and parts. In addition, new tactical features such as the &quot;Link System&quot; bring a new dimension of strategy to the game. Set in 2096, FM4 opens as an unidentified group of wanzers assaults and destroys an E.C. German base. The player?s point of view switches between two main characters that find themselves trapped within a dangerous global conspiracy. Elsa, a new recruit in the E.C.&#39;s Durandal corps, is sent to Germany with her team to investigate the attack. The story then shifts to Darril, a U.C.S. Army sergeant in South America. He and his company are sent to Venezuela after its governor declares independence from the U.C.S. Though Darril&#39;s squad seems far more interested in slacking off than fighting a war, their plans for early retirement are put on hold after they witness a fateful plane crash in the jungle.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2004-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-31T07:26:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1ff/1ff461f086e95afd3e4a893df4baaffe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.22, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 6, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 442, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Square Enix"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
