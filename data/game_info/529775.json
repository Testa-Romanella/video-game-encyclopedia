We had to finish coding the game and inject our own flavour into it along the way. My spin was the inclusion of a 'bossteroid', I kept the regular asteroids as GL_LINEs drawn by the engine rather than sprites, so\u00a0I could also draw what I envisioned to be the biggest baddest bossteroid in the galaxy. Can you beat the bossteroid?</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate your ship, use the up arrow key to thrust forward. Press the spacebar to shoot. Blow up all the asteroids on screen to progress to the next level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T07:54:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c8/0c899e8e4a57aa3032c764375571b498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Graham"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
