{"id": 923399, "slug": "irregular-one-page-edition", "name": "IRREGULAR - One Page Edition", "name_original": "IRREGULAR - One Page Edition", "description": "<p><strong>IRREGULAR</strong> is a simple TTRPG where the players create sentient robotic machine humanoids called PERSONALITY CONSTRUCTS (or <strong>'PCs'</strong>). Created by MAN, PERSONALITY CONSTRUCTS contain the capacity for human emotion, thought, and reasoning, as well as great POWERS that can surpass that of a NORMAL MAN. Outside of your immediate squadron, you are also free to interact with any of the other Networked Personality Constructs (or<strong> 'NPCs'</strong>) who collectively make up the breadth of society.</p>\n<p>However, for reasons still unexplained, after a period of time, PCs and NPCs begin to break down, and in the process, go into a berserk state called <strong>IRREGULAR</strong>. Should a PC or NPC go IRREGULAR, a team of IRREGULAR HUNTERS is dispatched, to incapacitate or--if necessary--kill the IRREGULAR.</p>\n<p>That's where you come in. You're an <strong>IRREGULAR HUNTER</strong>, one of the chosen, to be sure. You come in to a dangerous situation involving an IRREGULAR, and must stop or kill the IRREGULAR threat. But take care--fighting IRREGULARS is a dangerous business. It takes a toll, not just on your body, but on your emotions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>TAKE CARE WHEN FIGHTING IRREGULARS, LEST YE BECOME IRREGULAR YOURSELF</strong></p>\n<p>A larger version of\u00a0<strong>IRREGULAR</strong> is still in development; purchases go toward funding a larger expansion!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T07:09:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e7/7e7e9571ba59255f59f654dd93806db4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tidal Wave Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
