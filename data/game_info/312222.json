So do you have what it takes to get through it?</em></p>\n<p>This is a remake of a tiny gamejam game I made back in 2010. I've always wanted to revisit this concept and flesh it out a little more. I'm not done with it yet, this demo build has 6 levels of crazy difficulty, but I'd like to experiment with this more trying out a few different mechanics and more enemy types.\u00a0So if you try the game out and enjoy or have any feedback let me know as I'm still pondering what else to do with this.</p>\n<p><em>One more thing. I'm gonna level with you.\u00a0In all honestly I've not completed all 6 levels myself yet as it's quite hard but I'm fairly sure it's possible.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:09:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/900/900337a5f8c2850d098b23fb0e983ca0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Locked Door Puzzle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
