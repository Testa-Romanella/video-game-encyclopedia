Time is running out so we don't have the time to put some needed info into the game; the gimmick of the game is when you die, your pilot also dies so you have to save more pilots to get more lives. There's a screen on the right in the hangar after the corridor, the screen displays how many pilots you have left. When all 7 pilots have been collected in the map (their locations are marked on the map), you'll need to go to the core. The core is the red\u00a0door that says X Remaining which turns blue once all pilots have been rescued.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for understanding and we hope you still enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:42:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4f/a4f0c582143b66a78eea622e142e2cbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MammaAbbe"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
