These are more complex so there are fewer of them. This app is designed to help reinforce sentence construction and English grammar rules in a fun way. It is also on my website so it can be played as a quick break in classrooms if there are not enough tablets.<br/><br/>It can be used to help with spelling strategies, including sounding out, picture recognition, phonics and subject verb object forms and use of adjectives<br/><br/>in this game i have included 3 versions:<br/><br/>Countdown:\ta 60 second initial timer where the student tries to do as many words as they\u00a0<br/>can in time. This allows classrooms with less access to technology to take turns easier. It also has bonus time if they can complete each level in time.\u00a0<br/><br/>Pictures Round:\tThere are 50 sentences with picture clues to try to help them if they are having difficultly, the visuals also help young learners who are not ready for just words yet.<br/><br/>Word hints:\tThere is a short word hint if the question mark is pressed that may help if the children or students are struggling.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>I am an English teacher and teach literacy, reading strategies and phonics to young learners.
