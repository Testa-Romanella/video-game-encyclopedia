Unfortunately the scientists that did it couldn't find the things they needed, but now Bat Gyorgi has a pair of hands with their own opinion on his back. With extreme luck and creative disguise now he was able to find a job as night shift janitor. He is trying to keep his job, but his hands make nasty things behind his back (literally). Help him clean the room before the Dirt Meter on the top is filled. You will have a couple of tools to achieve this.</p>\n<p>Shoes Power Up</p>\n<p>These handy dandy pair of boots give you speed like nothing before. Redbull gives you wings, these give you lightning speed.</p>\n<p>A Bucket With Water</p>\n<p>As is the rifle for the marine this is the bucket for the janitor. When you hit the bucket you have temporary cleaning bonus.</p>\n<p>But be careful! There are not only power ups.</p>\n<p>Mouse Trap</p>\n<p>Make sure that you don't step on some of them. Placed in random places to catch mice they also incapacitate you for a while. What kind of mice are hunting these guys? Huh.</p>\n<p>A Bag of Trash</p>\n<p>Your hands with opinion on their own randomly throw bags of trash. If you catch them in the air you won't get to clean afterwards, but if you miss it and it falls on the floor you get to clean all the mess.</p>\n<p>A Pot With Flower</p>\n<p>From time to time your inner beast will shoot bullets. Be careful not to break the pots with the flowers I have heard that your boss is emotionaly connected to them.</p>\n\n<p>Global Game Jam 2022 ---- Jam Theme : Duality</p>\n<p>Contributors:</p>\n<p>Sakelarov\u00a0- Lead Unity Developer</p>\n<p>Menichko - Game Designer and Pixel art</p>\n<p>Infinitum -\u00a0Unity\u00a0Developer</p>\n<p>Billy - Pixel art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T10:05:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d5ace9d5d952a53235c6f36b0fcac61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sakelarov", "Menichko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
