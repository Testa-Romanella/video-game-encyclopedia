{"id": 323081, "slug": "hammerting", "name": "Hammerting", "name_original": "Hammerting", "description": "<p>Hammerting is a vertical dwarven mining colony sim with RPG elements.<br />\nManage a clan of colorful dwarves, establish an epic mining operation, craft legendary swords and delve deep for greater glory, riches... and danger.<br />\nWith a war raging on the surface, the dwarves pledge to delve deep and, as the master craftspeople they are, produce and supply whatever is needed. From humble beginnings, you start with a few, hurried dwarves who need to set up operations. Ultimately, your small clan of dwarves will be known throughout the Upper Realms for their skill, and the base will span kilometers.Crafting for Victory<br />\nAllies on the surface have all manner of requests. Dwarves may find themselves asked to craft oodles of silver swords against an oncoming vampire army. For an elf princess\u2019s coronation, they\u2019ll wish for nothing less than a Legendary Diamond-Encrusted Gold Crown of Divine Ruling +3.<br />\nWith the overworld in need, every successful delivery takes you one step closer to triumphing against evil.<br />\nAs your dwarves increase in skill and your base expands, build conveyor belts and elevators to free them of manual labor.Colorful Personalities<br />\nDoes \u00c5gl\u00f6f\u2019s fancy ancestry clash with Vargskreva\u2019s humble upbringing? Is your explorer afraid of the dark? Has your master crafter reached her Ballmer Peak? Exploit your dwarves\u2019 strengths as well as their weaknesses to succeed.<br />\nEach dwarf is richly and uniquely defined through it\u2019s stats, dwarven ancestry, traits, abilities, equipment, movement set, and more.<br />\nA dwarf may go out of her way to achieve her goals - and they may not always align with the player\u2019s.<br />\nEvents in a dwarf\u2019s life can give them new abilities and traits.Skilled Craftspeople<br />\nAnyone can craft an iron sword; but only dwarves can haggle a Crystal Cave Dragon to sell her fiery plasma breath, pump it up to a Andthril Forge of Doom and use it to craft an... Iron Sword +2.<br />\nWith every strike of the hammer on the anvil, a skilled dwarf has a chance to crit, making the result all that much better.<br />\nThe chain for completing a single great item is long. First, find and mine some gold ore. Carry it home. Smelt it into ingots. Take the ingots and make a crown. Take the crown to the jeweler and insert perfectly cut rubies, imbuing it with a glow that radiates happiness to everyone around. Then take it to the runesmith and inscribe it with a powerful dwarven rune. Elegant HomeTechnically, one could design doors and rooms roughly sized after the person using them, but that is not the dwarven way. A leeway margin of at least 5.25 meters is recommended in the Dwarven Architecture Handbook, but of course, that was written by a half-dwarf, half-environmentalist. Real dwarves need at least 11 meters.<br />\nThe dwarves like to give everything they do an extra touch. Hanging banners around the base, polishing their walkways, and replacing ladders with grandiose elevators are all things that make the dwarves happy.Living Cave<br />\nDwarven Beer Recipe: Farm wheat, preferably in a dry, but not barren biome. Grind it, put it in a lake, and boil for two weeks. Hunt down and add three Malty Slimes, stir. Boil for another week. Chill. Add two liters of yeast from a Sweaty Swamp Ogre (find them by following the stench of Musty Mangrove Moss), cover and ferment.<br />\nBiomes ranging from sandy deserts to nordic forests and blistering lava caves. Of course each biome is visually unique and contains its own set of flora, fauna, hazards, special locations, and events.<br />\nPlants can be farmed, or harvested in the wild.<br />\nIndigenous creatures can be attacked, used to your advantage, or simply avoided.VerticalityDwarves are big on elevators, but not so much on free falling. It follows that they\u2019d have their own takes on hellevators. For example, members of Clan Steelbrow prefer a traditional shaft dug straight down, straddled by a crane with a 300 meter rope, and nothing but a barrel to stand in. Needless to say, the barrel\u2019s built-in bar is stocked with ale.<br />\nOnly in the deepest depths will you find the most powerful materials, the warmest magma, the rarest treasures, and the most dangerous conditions.<br />\nFiguring out the fastest and safest route down - and up again - is a chief concern, but you\u2019ll have plenty of unique dwarven mechanisms to help you do so.<br />\nFeatures liquid and physics mechanics for pumping lava to your hearths, brewing beer, tossing torches down shafts to light up the unknown, and more.ModdingDon\u2019t like the game?
