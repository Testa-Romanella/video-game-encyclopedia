Try the download files if you have any problems</p>\n<p>I've been trying to develop a character movement framework for godot, that works on any genre (2D included)\u00a0so I can prototype faster, this is the result. I had too many hassles with godot 3 limitations so I opted to focus on godot 4. It has some\u00a0fancy mechanics like coyote time and input buffers for jumping, and bunny hoping since someone always ask for it.</p>\n\n<p>This demo also contains some tools besides the character framework:</p>\n<ul><li>The map was made with 2D autotiles, I made a script that translates it to 3D with a modular piece, and it can optimice it with MultiMesh chunks and joining collision shapes, rather than having 200 meshes and colliders. I want to make it an individual plugin in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li>The gun has a special shader that prevents it from clipping walls, and has it's own FOV to preserve the model shape. This is standard in FPS games, but godot doesn't have native tools for this, making a second viewport is cumbersome and expensive.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>ASDW: Move || Right Click: Shoot || Left Click: Zoom Aim || R: Reload || ESC/Tab: Capture/Free mouse</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T13:33:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc1/cc1e23dcc7bc6922f83f4d1439e91ade.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Carpyn"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
