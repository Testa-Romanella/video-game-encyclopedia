Can you complete all 5 puzzles?</p>\n<p>Playtime: &lt;5min</p>\n<p>No sound.</p>\r\nAfterthoughts\r\n<p>I had a lot of fun designing these block puzzles!\u00a0 Unfortunately, Unity does not natively serialize 2D\u00a0arrays, so I wasn't able to design levels as easily as I wanted. That's why to save time, there are only 5 simple levels.<br/><br/>The last level requires a lot of keypresses, which is tedious. I should have definitely added a delayed keyrepeater. I'm also seeing a lot of other spots I can polish/improve on, so I\u00a0may revisit this project one day.<br/><br/>But for now, onto the next game!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82f/82f8778752a3f8940ce034bbeb294aa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clorica6"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
