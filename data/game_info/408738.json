You decide to spend it in your apartment, and just relax. You can watch TV, listen to music, read a book, play on your computer, or take a nap. Either way, just take it easy, and relax. This is your \"me\" day.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This is not a game. It's a toy. A collection of interactive nooks and crannies.\u00a0A meta-game, if you will. There's no goal, just a bunch of stuff you can do, with no consequences, no urgency.</p>\n<p>This meta-game is currently in development. More stuff will be added eventually.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Consider donating if you like the concept!</em></strong> Your donations will help me keep working on it, and more gadgets for you to play with :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T03:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/10802447d09961570b489c2946e6a13d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Jalbert"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
