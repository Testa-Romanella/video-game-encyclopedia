It basically is a competitive Doom-like/Tower Defense game where you can choose to play the good guy or the bad mastermind!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe original idea behind Bad Mood is to place the hero in a big non-linear 80's inspired level that he must exit while the bad guy is trying to defeat him dropping units in the level. The good guy has to look for keycards, bonus and weapons to progress through the level and reach the exit.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBut Bad Mood is a quite ambitious project, and we're a very little team (we only are one programmer and one level artist, with help from our concept artist friends), therefore we decided to reduce the scope of the project for our first prototype.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>THE PROTOTYPE<p>\r\nThat being said, we're very happy to present you our Bad Mood prototype! This prototype will consist of a Classic and a Survival Mode, which you can play in both local multiplayer and solo. In Classic Mode, the Good Guy has to escape a level while the Bad Guy has to stop him.
