Well then, I have the cruisers for you! Come on! Take your pick: the Mk1 or the Mk2. Oh you're not so sure? Why don't you step inside, see how they look. You can\u00a0kick back, relax, and explode on a wall with your unconventional thrusters and sub-par flying skills.\u00a0 But no worries! They're a dime a dozen - I can get you a replacement in a jiffy!</em></p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0Arrow keys to move, space to shoot, Esc to open the pause menu</p>\n<p><strong>LazerKick </strong>is a challenging physics-based space battler. The turning, thrusting, and kickback take time to get used to, but are gratifying to master. Fight in a close-quarters clash or join an all-out chaotic war.</p>\n<p>I made this game in collaboration with @Bonqe - who created all of the Music and sound effects along with giving a helping hand in Unity. Take a look at his soundcloud here:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/bonqe/\u00a0And the main menu music can be found here:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/bonqe/no-sound-in-space</p>\n<p>If you're having any performance issues with the game, download the windows version! It comes with fullscreen :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T22:08:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ba/1bab870bf491e43c457cbc0b54fc0c0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BirdCat Nate"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
