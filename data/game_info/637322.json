Your goal is to extend that timer as much as you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You gain 10 seconds\u00a0to the timer when you bring a Red Team Head inside their goal line (to the left, on the 2nd screenshot), but beware, because you can lose 10 seconds if they bring a Blue Bubblehead's head in your goal line instead!</p>\n<p>You can pick up and throw your heads to stun the enemy team. Just make sure you're throwing the right color!\r\n </p>\n<p>Stunned characters will be unable to move for a few seconds, they will lose what they had picked up and will drop their own head.\r\n </p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS\r\n </p>\n<p>- Move with Arrow Keys<br/>- Press X to detach/respawn your head<br/>- Press Z to grab a bubblehead/throw a grabbed bubblehead<br/>-\u00a0Press F5 to restart the game</p>\n<p>Started working on this project on July 9th at 5 PM EST.<br/>All assets are my own.\u00a0BGM can be listened to here:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/user-565668188/bubblehead-bash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:27:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/4686824447d7720170b06ef986505d59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harieiv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
