Armed with a pair of rhythm blasters, you shoot and smash targets to the beat of a soundtrack featuring songs from some of the world\u2019s most popular electronic artists. The better your timing, accuracy and form, the better your score. The better your score, the higher your place on the Audica Leaderboards.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAudica is incredibly intuitive and immersive from the first time you play - use your blue and orange blasters to shoot color-coded targets to the beat while in a breathtaking cosmic arena. On expert difficulty, Audica gameplay is intense and exacting. If you want to claim a spot at the top of the leaderboards, you\u2019ll need to practice until you and your blasters become one, performing a tightly choreographed ballet of beat-blasting brilliance.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T02:56:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/617/6179a0fc7f378481376ac06833640ab8.jpg", "website": "http://www.audicagame.com", "rating": 4.12, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 52, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 112, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Harmonix Music Systems"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Harmonix Music Systems"], "esrb_rating": null}
