My name is Double H, and this is my first project finished for My First Game Jam 2018, Winter Edition. It is a romance visual novel with anime influences, where you take the role of a young lady looking for a school club. Will the cooking club hold everything she's ever needed? Only time will tell.</p>\n<p>The piece I'm presenting is a demo, a larger story was planned, but no time was found to finish it. While I felt confident about the complete project, after the jam is over I have no plans in the immediate future to finish this game. Of course, if people are interested and conditions are favorable, it should not be a great hassle to do so.</p>\n<p>I want to thank my team for the amazing job they've done for me and all the people I met this year at the jam. You'll find your name in the credits' special thanks.</p>\n<p>Here's our contact addresses:</p>\n<p>http://a-doubleh-x.tumblr.com/</p>\n<p>detectiu.alex@gmail.com</p>\n<p>http://speedydumpling.tumblr.com</p>\n<p>http://aeryel.tumblr.com/<br/></p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/_aeryel<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/042/042ff8e82d2b09bd85bfd2b2c6ea7feb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["doubleh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
