A single player \"Arcade Mode\"\u00a0was added by popular request for a single player experience, as well as an endless enemy wave \"Survival Mode.\" The game features about one dozen playable characters that can be unlocked on the character selection screen by pressing the CTRL key. There are about half a dozen stages in Arcade Mode, but unfortunately the single player Arcade Mode was never fully completed.</p>\n<p>For the best experience, grab a friend and try out the Versus Mode, the game's main attraction! Share the keyboard or use Joy2Key to map keys to gamepads.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf5/cf5142d070284e5beaf73fb0f1a79f0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["phubans"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
