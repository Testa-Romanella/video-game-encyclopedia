Two explorers find their way into the illusive temple, finding themselves trapped in a dynamic, yet parallel path towards their own fates.<br/>Who exactly is Somnus? Why is the temple cursed? What is the secret behind the mysterious artifacts? And how does this tale all tie into the future of our humanity?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Animus Toil is an experimental puzzle-adventure game, featuring two playable characters and randomized room sequences, giving each player different experiences. While each puzzle can be solved on their own, it is encouraged for players to exchange solutions and reach the game's end together.<br/>Each playthrough has an estimated completion time of 1-2 hours, and there are 4 possible endings to discover.<h3>\"Proceed with curiosity.\"</h3><br/>Play the PC port for FREE!
