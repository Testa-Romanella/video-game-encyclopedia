You can try to do changes along network by left clicking on reciever cube object and right clicking on target cube object. Then you check communication option toggles and hit \"Send\" button. And then watch what's changed. There are Debug log below the scene. There you can read messages about what is changed and why. In this example I used color palette to change color of targeted object for several recievers.</p>\n<p>I have believe that this app can help someone to understand how network games works.</p>\n<p>Try to make fun playing it! See you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64d0c00f5b1d0f916bd74c3ddeca955f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["erofes"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
