The object of the game is to figure out a word by guessing. Letters in the guess that match the letters in the word will be highlighted in red. Letters in the guess that are in the word but not in the correct position will be highlighted in yellow. If you do not figure out the word in five guesses, you lose one chance and a new word is selected. If you guess a word that is not five letters or is not a real word you lose a chance but you get to keep guessing the current word. You have five chances, once they are all gone the game is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0c615a8a5f6a18ca99dc1d4c433b1cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["T\u00b3 Software"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
