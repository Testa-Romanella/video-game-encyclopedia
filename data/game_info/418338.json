Go into the sewers and<strong> ELIMINATE THE SOURCE OF SLIME!</strong></p>\n<p>The outcomes of all attack and defence are pre-determined and shown to the player. Fight your way through 6 procedurally-generated levels of slime-infested 1980's imaginings of what sewers might look like in 1999, and manage your sequences of combat outcomes to defeat the source of slime at the bottom of the sewer.</p>\n<p>This is my entry in the 7 Day Roguelike 2020 game jam.<br/></p>\n<p>Playing in a browser?
