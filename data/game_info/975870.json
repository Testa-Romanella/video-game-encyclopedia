What was it like to fly through relentless anti-aircraft fire over Nazi-occupied Europe? What was it like to have a thin layer of steel between life and death at 15,000 feet? How did it feel to furiously fend off enemy fighters zipping around your plane and then to precisely deliver your payload over enemy targets?<br/><br/>Find out for yourself as you lead a 10-man crew to victory... or defeat... against squadrons of Nazi warplanes in the legendary B-17 Flying Fortress!<h3>Redux</h3>The same experience remastered with the original engine upgraded to support the functionality present in DX 12.
