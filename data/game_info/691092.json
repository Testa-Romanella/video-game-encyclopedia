The furnace needs to stay hot enough, but not too hot. Remember to also release some pressure by pulling the steam lever. Keep an eye on the arrows above the gearbox, and make sure that the switch is in the correct slot! Match numbers on the electrical box with the correct light to keep the engine happy. The <strong>CLOCK</strong> keeps track of your progress so check out your score in the game over\u00a0screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong><br/>Shuhmo (everything else) <br/>Anniv4x (custom art, custom sfx)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> <br/>SPACE to add fuel to furnace<br/>DOWN ARROW to release steam<br/>LEFT/RIGHT ARROW to switch gearbox position<br/>WASD to control the electrical box<br/><br/><strong>Creator comments:</strong><br/> This is our fourth game jam together, and first game jam that isn't Ludum Dare! Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to fully commit to this project, but it was nonetheless a great learning experience. We look forward to trying out the submitted games, and hope you enjoy ours!
