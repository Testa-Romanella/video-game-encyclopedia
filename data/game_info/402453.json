It was very fun to make and I really want to try and port it into mobile, but there are a lot of things that need to be fixed before that and I'm not sure I can do that (yet).</p>\n<p>I followed a tutorial from Sykoo to make the base game and I used particles from the asset store (called SimpleFX). I got the sounds using SFXR and made the music on BOSCA CEOIL.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T03:58:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d34/d34368a8ae69899544b794d9e09ec47c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AMN"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
