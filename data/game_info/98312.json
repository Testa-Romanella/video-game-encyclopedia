You are incredibly tired and you need sleep. It's simple like that. Just lay on your keyboard to fall asleep.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\nBut there is something bothering you in your sleep. Don't let your dreams turn into nightmares - wake up before anything scary or dangerous happens!\r\n</p>How to play<p>\r\n\tThe most comfortable way is to place a small pillow on your keyboard. Game checks for any key press and release.\r\n</p><p>\n</p>Q&amp;APillow? For real?<p>\r\n\tYeah! Using some dark magic I connected standard pillow to this game.\r\n</p>Does it work with every pillow type?<p>\r\n\tI tried my best to keep backward compatibility with most used models. But I can't test it on every device so I'm not promising it will work for everyone!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBut being serious: It all depends on a keyboard. It might not work on flat keyboards like most laptops have, and you might experience some difficulties if your keyboard have sleep, hibernate or power buttons!\r\n</p>Game is moddable?<p>\r\nYes! Latest version of a game stores dreams in external files. You can check them in installation folder. Mod or add what you want!\r\n</p><p>\r\nCheck \"Mods Help.html\" for more information! It's easy.\r\n</p>What is P-Jam?<p>\r\n\tP-Jam was a 24 hour jam held during Pyrkon, fantasy convention in Pozna\u0144, Poland. P-Jam is actually a wordplay for Pajamas! Whole Jam was based around sleeping and theme was \"It was only a dream\".\r\n</p>You got typo in game name!<p>\r\n\tIT written uppercase means Information Technology. ;)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/946/946b46ab0b64d485353901cb360b1e9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Threef"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
