Meleda praised Zadrian as a national hero, showering him with fame and glory that far exceeded what they had once shown his elder brother Zecharias, the kingdom's finest knight. Zech was not only engaged to the princess, he was also the acting commander of the Meledian army... And most importantly, he was Zade's big brother\u2013 the man who Zade loved and respected more than anyone else. Feeling like his very presence had become a stain on his dear brother's  reputation, Zade decided to leave the capital and set off on a new journey to the Temenos of Vesta. He took with him on his quest only a single traveling companion: Accorte Roland, a student of Sphire's magic academy and the daughter of a man who once saved Zade's life...", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T05:58:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01daa22b0ead4d9c1d274c2d95396dc6.jpg", "website": "https://vestariasagaii.dangenentertainment.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 382, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vestaria Project"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["DANGEN Entertainment", "Gamera Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
