To do this, you need to be quick, yet precise in three Micro-Games! Simply use your mouse to play!</p>\n\n<p>Gather Coffee, Sugar and Milk (or oat milk) from the streets by clicking the right trucks as they wizz by! Try to avoid things that aren't coffee, sugar or (oat) milk to keep the quality high!</p>\n\n<p>Roast the gathered beans using your patented Kaiju Fire Breath! But make sure to not overdo it, or the coffee quality goes down!</p>\n\n<p>Grind the beans by perfectly smashing your teeth together! But be careful, a wrong bite and your teeth might get damaged, lowering the quality!</p>\n\n<p>Finally, embrace your creative side and draw a bit of Latte Art for the judges to enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>\"Rhonda\" is always in a hurry and thus expects speed,\u00a0 \"Ferdinand\" is looking for Quality and\u00a0\"Lux\" is looking for a good balance of both.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art and Programming by\u00a0DareLooks.<br/>Art, Programming and Sound Design\u00a0by Manikobunneh<br/>Character Art by Hoppelhoop -\u00a0https://twitter.com/hoppelhoop</p>\n<p>Music from the Game Dev Market Total Music Pack\u00a0https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/total-music-collection/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T08:11:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfc/cfcc5ae2f7750086c8259b643ca341cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Dare Looks", "Manikobunneh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
