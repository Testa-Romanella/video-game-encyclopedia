This game is a simple 2d platformer where your goal is to reach the end of the level. What makes this game unique is your ability to teleport, or rather, how you are able to teleport. You can shoot off a projectile and then teleport to it with a simple set of mouse button presses.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/041/04158008b1485942f2cc6d7935e052f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mwono"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
