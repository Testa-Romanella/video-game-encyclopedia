Discarded from the Gameboy screen and abandoned from your game, all you have left is your ability to feel lonliness. You embark on an epic (note: short and not-epic) quest to reclaim your body and find out why you were left to die.</p><p>This is my VERY FIRST game and was created for #gbjam3 - It was made entirely in Game Maker: Studio over the course of a few days. There are a few known bugs, this is really just a short prototype I made as I learned the program.</p><p>Player Forms -</p><p>1) Pixel. All you can do is move left and right.</p><p>2) Legs. You can move left and right and jump.</p><p>3) Full character. A bit faster, you can jump higher, double jump, wall jump, and kill enemies!</p><p>Controls -</p><p>Move - Left and right arrow keys.</p><p>Jump - Up arrow keys.</p><p>Wall jump - Press the arrow key away from the wall.</p><p>Kill Enemy - Jump on head.</p><p>Let me know what you think for my first game!
