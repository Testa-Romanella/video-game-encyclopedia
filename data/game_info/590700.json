Now, as a kid at an arcade in the 1980s, you can experience being a Starfury pilot as you prove your skills and take on pirate raiders.</p>\n<p>Use WASD or arrow keys to maneuver. Use Space Bar to fire your pulse cannons.\u00a0 Your ship has momentum.\u00a0 Once you accelerate the ship won't slow down until apply reverse thrust. If you start rotating, the ship will keep rotating until you apply rotational thrust in the opposite direction.\u00a0 When you accelerate forward rotation will decrease allowing you to use your main engines to stabilize your heading.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: There are simple on screen controls on mobile, they may be buggy as they were developed in an hour and tested on 1 phone.<br/></p>\n<p>There are currently 3 very basic missions. \u00a0More missions are under development.</p>\n<p><strong>Roadmap</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>External Analog Controller Support - I want the Starfury's controls to be incredibly responsive, but on keyboard the responsiveness is hard to manage.\u00a0</li><li>Enemy AI - right now raiders will change course randomly and also when you shoot them but I'm working on a rudimentary AI that lets them try to fight back</li><li>Big Ships - the goal of this game is NOT to take on pirate raiders. It is to be part of much larger battles. </li><li>Sound - at some point I hope there will be some.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T10:43:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/303/3033ceaf0145e1aec14c0397f36de143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["michaelfiber"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
