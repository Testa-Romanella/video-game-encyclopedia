{"id": 163938, "slug": "snakefill", "name": "SnakeFIll", "name_original": "SnakeFIll", "description": "<p>SnakeFill is a simple, but often challenging puzzle game. The objective is simply to fill out all the boxes in the square while starting and finishing at two fixed cells. You can always move to the neighbouring cells if they're empty, and in addition to that, you can move through the walls to the other side of the square - the exact rules for how this works varies across the levels. In order to beat all the levels, you will have to learn how to visualize patterns in more and more abstract ways.</p><p>SnakeFill is still undergoing active development, and all feedback is very much appreciated. We expect to launch the final version of the game just before Christmas 2016.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kirstine"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
