There are three others unfortunate enough to join you.\r\n\r\nA voice explains that only one of you will get out.\r\n\r\nYou will need to breathlessly run through an abandoned high school, a creepy hospital, a terrifying morgue and seemingly the depths of hell itself.  Racing against your peers, you will need to keep your wits about you, solve insidious clues, avoid demonic obstacles and ultimately find your way to the exit \u2013 before it\u2019s too late. \r\n\r\nFour will enter, but only one will leave.
