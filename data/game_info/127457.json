Built as a prototype for object interaction and 3D FPS movement practice I decided to release it as a fun side thing. It's not optimized and can be very buggy. Enjoy.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Mouse to look.</p><p>WASD to move. Space to jump.<br/></p><p>Right click to remove blocks. Left click to place blocks.</p><p>1-7 to choose a block color 0 to empty your hands.</p><p>Known issues:</p><p>I don't know how many blocks you can place, but each one does take up memory. Too many and it'll lag and then crash. Be careful.</p><p>The base block can be destroyed. If you have no blocks to connect new blocks to you cannot build. If you have 0 blocks restart the game.</p><p>Updates:</p><p>V1.1: Changed viewing angle locks from 60 to 90 degrees.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d11ee982b80a5057f3af0b61a9ad45ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4KbShort"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
