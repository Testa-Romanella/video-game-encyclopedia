{"id": 101514, "slug": "evie-itch", "name": "Evie (itch)", "name_original": "Evie (itch)", "description": "<p>A girl crashed into a dark forest not knowing where to go, curiosity drives her to open a Pandora\u2019s box that was never meant to be opened.</p>\n\n<p>Evie is a short first-person horror narrative that unfolds a mind-boggling event, set in the middle of an eerie forest that was left undiscovered for good reasons. The story starts off by reading diaries left in an abandoned house by a lady named Evie. As a player, you will quickly realize that great tragedies hit her life and uncontrollably fell into a downward spiral of despair.</p>\n<p>This game was a 3 months project made by Yasuka Taira (me) and Kensuke Hayashi (HS student and a student of mine.)<br/>Kensuke helped me write the story (diaries and documents.)<br/>I did all the visuals and designing.<br/>Shoutout to everyone who's helped us :D</p>\n<p>Due to my work and Kensuke's school, we were only working on it for 3 hours a day. Some days we just wanted to take a rest :P<br/>Unfortunately, we didn't have a programmer so the game might not be perfect, but we believe we did our best to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it :D</p>\n<p>This game is available in English and Japanese.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DISCLAIMERS:<br/>This game might contain disturbing scenes.
