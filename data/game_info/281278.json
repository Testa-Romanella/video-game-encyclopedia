It is up to you to make the correct choices, when to be bold by raiding and attacking your enemies, and when to exercise caution, by bolstering defences or favouring diplomatic relations. But be wary, for poor advice leads to mistrust meaning future advice could go unheeded at a time where it is imperative. Your monarch will turn to the other members of the court if they have to, who could even be under the influence of a rival Spymaster.<br/><br/>If information is power, then money is the key to unlocking it, so you can construct Brothels, Inns, Taverns and more in order to grease the wheels of espionage and fund your enterprises, but still, that will not be enough to ensure victory. The very best Spymasters know how to effectively use all of the assets at their disposal, so assassins, mercenaries, saboteurs, spies, and the subtle dispatch of misinformation all have parts to play in your counter-espionage efforts. Use them wisely.<br/><br/>Using population growth algorithms which take into account factors like age, gender, seasonal sickness, accidents, conscription and others, Tales of a Spymaster brings layers of complexity to a game world and how it affects your endeavours. For example, a heavy loss in a poorly chosen battle could be far more costly in the long run as it will mean population growth will shrink due to a new absence of appropriately aged men. A wise Spymaster knows that advising your Monarch to go to war should always be a last resort. <br/><br/>Remember, trust is of utmost importance, for all among the Royal court have their price. Whether clergy, nobility, military, many can be bought and bring downfall from within if given the chance. Root out these weeds before they can eat away at the foundation of your royal house and deal with them. Show them the price of betrayal, or blackmail them and use them against those that turned them.<br/><br/>If all else fails, you can even dabble in darker things like experimental poisons and virulent plagues, but take great care in dealing with such maleficence and always remember that a ruler with nobody to rule, is no ruler at all.  <br/><br/><br/>Tales of a Spymaster will continue development long after initial release upon Steam Early Access and with your support, we shall keep releasing FREE add-ons for the game.
