The total game re-balance and new mission rating system makes it more fun to play all previous levels once again, even if you have played before.<br/><br/>The mission rating mechanism has been changed from \"Don't touch my gems\" to \"Come touch my gems\" that you always get a 3-star rating for the mission as long as there are still 3 gems on the field! The enemy waves have been adjusted and where the gem dropped will also affect enemies\u2019 behaviors, all of these make the gameplay enjoyable with various of skills and tactics for many possible combinations.<br/><br/>Localization support: Chinese, German, French, Russian... and your native language may be eventually added at any time!<br/><br/>Why be good when you can be... bad? Cursed Treasure 2 is an addictive tower-defense game that puts the power of darkness at your fingertips. As a creature of ultimate evil, you don't ask for much... just to raze the odd kingdom and have your cache of all-powerful magical gems safely hidden away. Too bad the (ugh) good guys are out to steal them. Using the powers of the orcs, demons, and undead, you'll build unique and powerful towers along paths to destroy any hero that dares get close.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrade your undead crypts to instill fear in foes that make them flee in the opposite direction, or turn your demonic temples into mighty icons capable of turning the ground to lava beneath anyone's feet. You'll upgrade and enhance each unique type, and of course, unlock spells of your own to enter the fray... when the going gets tough, the tough drop meteors on everyone else, after all.<br/><br/>Sure, your enemies have paladins and angels and ninjas and more, but when you've got power like yours, they'll wish they stayed at home. Cursed Treasure 2 is casual but engaging tower-defense with style, packed with 27 levels that can be conquered normally or in Night Mode for even more challenge. It's good to be bad.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Three powerful and monstrous tower-types, each with their own unique skills to unlock!<br/></li><li>27 levels of maniacal mayhem across a lush fantasy world.<br/></li><li>Replay stages in re-balanced Night Mode with limited illumination for added challenge.<br/></li><li>Earn ability points to improve everything from spells to towers and more.<br/></li><li>A wide variety of enemies tricky powers and abilities to overcome.<br/></li><li>A vibrant and colorful style... just because you're evil doesn't mean you can't look good.</li></ul><h3>What's new in Ultimate Edition</h3><ul><li>3 gems instead of 5 and updated mission rating requirements: just keep all the gems on the level to get Brilliant!
