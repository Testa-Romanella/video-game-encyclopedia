Now lets look at the 4D camera. Its a spherical camera that always looks at center. By pressing q,e you can move the camera closer or farther away from the center, by using j,k,l,i,u,o you controls the angles of the spherical camera, changing where it looks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T16:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87d/87dd71133a0568885a282fcd049236b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tucan444"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
