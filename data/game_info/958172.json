This child, Lex, has lost their parents. One might think it is fortunate that Lex has a kindly uncle, unaware of children, but a decent sort, willing to take Lex in. One might. Lex can not help but feel responsible for their parents' death and is plagued with guilt. What could Lex have done differently? But their parents are gone, and in their uncles' benevolent neglect, Lex is often alone to sort things out. One night, Lex crept out to the dark garage where their uncle kept the remains of their parents' past lives, as well as his own forgotten past. Lex crept into the dark, desperate to find some meaning in the objects. But Lex doesn't know that they are pursued, that there is a darkness in the garage, a dragon.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>You are a recently orphaned child coming to terms with their trauma after their parent's death.</p>\n<p><strong>Nordic Game Jam 2023</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Art: Nomad Sculpt, Procreate,\u00a0Blender, Krita</li><li>Programming: Unity</li><li>Music: Digital Performer, Logic</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Sahlia Wong: Sound, Composition\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kris Karli: Story, Map design, Dialogue</p>\n<p>Sam Bennett: 3D assets, 2d Assets, Game Design</p>\n<p>Marc: Rigging, Lighting, Programming</p>\n<p>Niclas V: Level Design, User Interface, Visual Effects, Programming\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T15:38:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/534/53496db2ec14cfa9fdccfae3a191f9cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kartaal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
