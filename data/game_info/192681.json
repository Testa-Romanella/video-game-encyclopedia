You can refill energy by acquiring drops around the map or by destroying unfamiliars.</li><li><strong>Penalties:\u00a0</strong>Since you'll be\u00a0playing as a ghost you can't die, however coming into contact with enemies will drain your energy leaving incapable of moving and so the only way to go around that would be to restart, which could be just as annoying as seeing a death screen.</li><li><strong>Levers and interactive walls</strong></li></ul>\n<p>This is my first actual game and will continue to further develop it and am extremely keen on what feedback or suggestions you may have for me, if you would like to contact me directly my email is jasonny8899@gmail.com\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca6/ca67917f23be34749f16717c7e2543aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jasonny"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
