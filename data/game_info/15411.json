Faced with the daunting task of dealing with the world's evilest boss, stupidest minions, daringest freedom fighters, and troublesome-est posers, how do you survive a world where all sides are in conflict? Battle through hours of challenging combat (even we have to work hard to beat our own game), laugh out loud dialogue (but like, for real, not a 'lol'), and surprising story turns (seriously, a professional playwright wrote this game).<br/><br/>Heroes Must Die is an action-RPG with aesthetics inspired by the best roleplaying games of the 16 bit era, with the sophisticated story and design of modern epics. Follow a grand and fun story of trying to break the world and then save it. Combat is easy to learn and difficult to master.
