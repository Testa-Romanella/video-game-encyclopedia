{"id": 90706, "slug": "vogue", "name": "Vogue", "name_original": "Vogue", "description": "<p>Vogue is an experiment in creating a roguelite idle game.</p>\n<p>When you begin your journey into the dungeons of Vogue, you will have to click repeatedly in order to move and attack. As upgrades unlock at the store, you will spend less time clicking to move and more time upgrading your hero to face the more dangerous enemies that dwell further into the dungeon.</p>\n<p>The controls in Vogue are very simple</p>\n<p>Left Click anywhere in the screen - move your character/attack the enemy</p>\n<p>Left Click on a button to use/equip/etc.</p>\n<p>Right Click on most things to get information about them</p>\n<p>NOTE - The game will save automatically and you can also save from the More screen. You cannot copy the key in web browsers (Unity thing), but that's OK because it also saves to cookies.</p>\n<p>NOTE - Due to the nature of browser tabs and Unity Web GL, the game cannot progress very quickly when it's a background tab. Download the Windows standalone if you want to let Vogue run for a long time. </p>\n<p>NOTE: It seems that if you leave Vogue on its own tab in its own browser window, it will run in the background though at the correct speed..<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE - your character moves on his own path and will always clear out enemies, loot treasure, and move to the next room. You do not need to click anywhere specific. Just clicking causes the hero to take action.</p>\n<p>BACKGROUND MUSIC CREDITS</p>\n<p>Songs From An Unmade World 2 by Visager is licensed under a Attribution License. <br/>Based on a work at http://visager.bandcamp.com/album/songs-from-an-unmade-world-2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74fa0db764926ba08616e078c6fbed60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["morphinegames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
