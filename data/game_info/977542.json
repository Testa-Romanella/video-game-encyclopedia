Good maintenance will help your engine last longer after a long night of abuse and overheating.<br/><br/><br/>Take parts off your cars, place them into storage and sell them for some extra cash or transfer them onto another vehicle you own. When you have some spare cash, take a trip to \"Top Garage\" to buy some new parts for your exterior, interior, wheels, engine and/or handling.<br/><br/><br/>Progress through the underworld by entering a \"PA\"(Parking Area) and start negotiating wagers with any local crew members who care to race you. You are free to walk around any \"PA\" and bask in the thick atmosphere of smog and secondhand cigarette smoke.<br/><br/><br/>The local racers are not impressed with newcomers and will make their disdain known. Impress them by winning and they will change their tone.<br/><br/><br/>Earn cash by beating racers in 1vs1 wagers but be warned; these are real wagers and you will lose the money you bet if you lose the race! Some racers will take pity on you and give you a chance to win your money back by suggesting a 'double or nothing' race. It's your choice if you want to take that risk.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-26T07:28:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/220/2201f5e0207237dec97715356b254284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PLANET JEM"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["PLANET JEM"], "esrb_rating": null}
