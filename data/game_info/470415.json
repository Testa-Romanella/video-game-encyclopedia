Some produce resources for you, others make your inhabitants happy. Well-fed and happy peeple produce more resources, but keep them hungry or sad and they will leave. They might seem a bit lazy, but without them, buildings won't produce anything!</p>\n<p>Build your first house and somebody will come soon, but there is no rush! Take your time and explore the island. There is no pressing matter, no harsh lose-condition, so be creative and build something beautiful.</p>\n<p>Be good to them, and have fun.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This little game started as a quarantine project, partly inspired by my desire to create a relaxing city-builder and mostly inspired by\u00a0this\u00a0amazing tile-set by\u00a0<strong>Cluly</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is a pico-8 project, so the default controls are Z, X, and the arrow-keys.</p>\n<p>Can also be found on the pico-8 BBS.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T03:03:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c24/c24c59a3e92134bb318c341363d451c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["partnano"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
