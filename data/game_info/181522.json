Points will be awarded for how well targets are hit, with bonuses being for things like quick/no-scopes, long-shots, and and kill-streaks.<br/></p>\n<p>You have an unlimited amount of ammunition but the guns capacity is only\u00a08 bullets so reload times will factor into overall times - especially if you reload more often.</p>\r\nDESIGN\r\n<p>As well as scope up and shoot, the player has most of the controls of your average FPS including walking, strafing, crouching, jumping, and sprinting.</p>\n<p>The gun fires perfectly forward but drops over distance adding to the needed skill for highscores. The bullets can also take a fraction of a second to fly meaning timing is everything.</p>\r\nLEADERBOARDS\r\n<p>The game has a local and a global leaderboard - this means you can compete world-wide for either the quickest speedrun or the highest score!</p>\r\nOPTIONS\r\n<p>Want to change your crosshair colour? Or maybe lower the volume for the main menu specifically? This game has great options and customisability.\u00a0</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\n<p>All controls can be re-mapped from the in-game\u00a0settings.</p>\n<ul><li>Look: Mouse Axis</li><li>Fire: Mouse 0</li><li>Scope: Mouse 1</li><li>Move Forward: W</li><li>Move Left: A</li><li>Move Backward: S</li><li>Move Right: D</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Sprint: Shift</li><li>Crouch: Control</li><li>Jump: Space</li><li>Reload: R</li><li>Pause: Escape</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dd/0dd8a0cb0da20972a0b8704f32186ad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toby Smith"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
