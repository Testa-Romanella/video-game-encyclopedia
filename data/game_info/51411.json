In settings, you can turn on interesting elements that make the maze even more challenging, fun and more interesting. For example, moving walls, demons and dragons. When you turn on all the elements, the maze will become almost insurmountable.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour task is to find a golden tower. Do not be fooled by the maze and its traps.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/912ffd6ac8cb45d74a762b387844f2de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Rychl\u00fd"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Daniel Rychl\u00fd"], "esrb_rating": null}
