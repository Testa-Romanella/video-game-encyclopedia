These dolls are traditionally sold at northern hot springs as souvenirs.<strong> Kik\u014d (\u7d00\u884c)</strong> translates to \u2018travel journal\u2019, so in English the game could be called \u201cThe Travel Journal of a Kokeshi\u201d.</p>\n<p>This\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0game\u00a0that I developed as part of my final year degree at Abertay University. It is a computer game adaptation of Bash\u014d's '<strong>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</strong>', made in Unity using the <strong>Yarn Spinner</strong> tool.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>This adaptation features Kokeshi Dolls as the characters, and the environment has been crafted to look like a wold in which the doll belong - hand carved and wooden.</p>\n<p>This project would not be possible without the amazing work of<strong> Chizuko Nakamura</strong>, the voice actress who recites the Haiku in-game. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Please note that this current version is an early release build, more work will be carried out for a final release. The next steps on the roadmap are improving character control, re-working the audio and implementing the next level.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T06:11:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26d/26d578504cd25ae6293a51cf55e4d6c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Goward"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
