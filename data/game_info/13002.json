All the characters and items you interact with are literally swapped with each other, so you could be Plunger the Brave, whose quest is to open the locked pants of legend and solve outlandish item combination puzzles like putting butter on robots (that would totally short its circuits). <br/><br/>ADventure Lib is not a long game, but it is designed for re-playability - much of the fun is found by playing multiple times and discovering new [often unintentional] jokes, and new object-specific puns and dialogue.Should I Play ADventure Lib?If you like randomness, puns, point &amp; click adventures, and parodies, then definitely. This is a silly game, for silly people.Object ManagerWant to add even more awesome wackiness? There is now an Object Manager that allows you to add your own objects or characters, to be immediately shuffled into the game! You can draw a banana, record yourself saying \"banana\" and before you know it you could be walking around as <strong>Banana</strong> the Brave!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d1/9d1a9b6311fbf8c2c573c823aab9a347.jpg", "website": "http://adventurelib.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 63, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fancy Fish Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fancy Fish Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
