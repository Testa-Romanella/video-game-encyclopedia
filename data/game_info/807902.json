{"id": 807902, "slug": "kronchy", "name": "Kronchy", "name_original": "Kronchy", "description": "<p>This is my first game that I created during my first semester at college. It is a basic platformer inspired by retro games. Kronchy is a game about a small robot trying to rid the world of evil triangles. My experience with coding is limited but I have studied game design from Extra Credits and Game Maker's Tool Kit for years. This project is complete aside from bug fixes. I know that I could make the game better with the knowledge I have gained making it, but that would require a complete re-do and I would prefer to focus on my next game. I hope you enjoy this small learning project.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T13:52:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/095/095b4bb819ded23e2e3b80baea5e4fe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Redfire_Gaming"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
