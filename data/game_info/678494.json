Timer runs out?\u00a0 Restart from the beginning. Lose all of your lives?\u00a0\u00a0Restart from the beginning. It's a simple premise, but with a sense of urgency. It would be interesting to see this game speed-run in the future. Once I've added a good bit more of levels I will bring this up again on my socials.\u00a0 At the moment the only lore we have to go with is that Blue (the main character) is trying brave the dungeons riddled with obstacles and treasure to get to his partner who is being held captive by the evil King Squidulous and his army of baddies. Time is against you, and so is King Squidulous and his\u00a0Squid Army! The ever burning feud between the Blobs and Squids is coming to a closure, and its all up to YOU!</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\"A\" = left,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"D\" = right,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"J\" = shoot,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"K\" = jump,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"R\" teleport to start,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Backspace\" = pause,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"ESC\" quit,</p>\n<p><strong>XBOX 360/ONE Gamepad Controls:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>D-pad left/right for movement,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"X\" = shoot,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"A\" = jump,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Y\" = teleport to start,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Start\" = pause,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Back\" = quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T08:40:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/986/9865bd91bbc3023742a6cb10710667b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZmanTheTech"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
