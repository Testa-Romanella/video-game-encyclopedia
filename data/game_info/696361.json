I'd like to create and include a new power up for availability after killing one of the enemies.</p>\n<p>3. I\u00a0plan to create a third level for the portal, by removing the boss in the second level and placing him in the third. I'll redesign the second level with more strategic play with the environment.</p>\n<p>4.I\u00a0need to change the camera. I'm not able to look around at enemies approaching and want a wider view or something to help me see the bigger picture.</p>\n<p>5. I'll change the game name and update the menu to reflect that. The name will depend on the texture I can get created.</p>\n<p>6. I'd love to see if I could manipulate the shooter script to have a different item shot from the guns.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T06:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e07/e07c252a1c6d378dd6104d63302e059a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SquirrelJ"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
