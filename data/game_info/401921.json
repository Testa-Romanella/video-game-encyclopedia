In the last decades, the human inhabitants of planet earth have ventured into space for exploration and other goals. In this time, they have left behind a huge number of objects that now orbit their planet, some of which are still useful, such as satellites, some of which are only junk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wether useful or not, all kinds of space debris pose a threat to launching spacecraft as well as to other objects in orbit (other satellites, the ISS, etc.). So far, no transnationally coordinated project to clean space has been launched, only initiatives to reduce the growth in numbers.</p>\n<p>In the game, you control a space cleaner whose sole job is to clear the paths of launching space craft. Should a space craft collide with any debris (or with yourself), your troubles will have been in vain, so watch out and keep cool.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T01:53:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38f/38f9ccf4b9d2e170cfa77bc811f16adc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mikos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
