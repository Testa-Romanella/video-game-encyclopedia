She wishes for a voice to sing as her deepest wish is to be an idol and make people happy with her singing.\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Her wish is granted as she and four other girls are chosen by the star and become magical girl idols. The single condition is that the five girls unite and fight against sound gulping monsters that spread around the\u00a0<br/>universe, stealing peoples voices.\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>All is well until an evil witch replaces their memories with fake ones. After Nana regains her memories, she tries to find her friends and give them their real memories back.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You controll Nana by pressing WASD or the Arrow keys to the beat, if you miss a beat, you\u00b4ll lose HP. But dont worry you start regenerating HP when you hit the buttons at the right time! This will also fill the Special bar, which allows you to oneshot enemies.</strong><br/><br/><em>Sometimes its better to stay still for a moment and listen to the beat rather than frantically mashing buttons!</em><br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Done for MagicalGirlGamejam#2<br/>https://itch.io/jam/magical-girl-game-jam-2<br/>Our themes were\u00a0[<strong>Hidden</strong>] [<strong>Star</strong>] and\u00a0[<strong>Double</strong>] [<strong>Dealing</strong>]<br/><br/>Thanks to Ran d\u00b4Reille for hosting this awesome Jam!<br/>https://itch.io/profile/ran-dreille<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>LordVonAdel</strong> - Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>itstimetohosh</strong> - Level Designer, Art Direction<br/>https://twitter.com/itstimetohosh</p>\n<p><strong>laviolii</strong> - Character Design,Animation, Story,\u00a0UI<br/>https://twitter.com/waatamelon<br/><br/>Music<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Hyleo</strong><br/>https://soundcloud.com/hyleo<br/><br/>huge thanks again for letting us use your songs!<br/><br/>SFX<br/>Kenney<br/>https://www.kenney.nl/</p>\n<p><strong>Huge thanks to everyone that supported urs during this Jam!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T04:55:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/305a26780359335437da7d67f4b77006.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LordVonAdel", "Lavioli Prokrastinatori", "itstimetohosh"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
