Familiar objects behave strangely. Interact with light sources and shadow objects to solve puzzles. Explore night locations, collect crystals to activate various mechanisms and portals. And use the lightbulb in your head.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Night Lights</strong> is 2D puzzle platformer, based on lights and shadows interaction, currently <strong>in development for Windows/Mac/Linux</strong>.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFeatures: <br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Shadow objects</strong>, changing their shape or disappearing completely in the light </li>\n<li>Different <strong>night places</strong> to explore: forests, city rooftops and more strange locations </li>\n<li>Various mechanisms, powered by <strong>crystals</strong> </li>\n<li>System of <strong>portals</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Lightbulb</strong> in your head</li>\n</ul><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is \r\n\t<strong>early demo</strong><strong> </strong>of the game, created for Indiegogo &amp; Greenlight campaigns. Demo is short and will take <strong>~15 minutes</strong> to finish. It shows basic gameplay features and captures overall mood and direction in which the game is moving.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tNight Lights is working fine with <strong>Xbox 360/Xbox One</strong> controllers. Some other controllers should work as well, but I didn't test them. Tooltips are only available for Xbox controllers at this moment.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlso the demo is mostly linear, but in full game there will be more complex portal network.</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS:</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>ARROWS \u2014 Walk</strong></li>\n<li><strong>SPACE \u2014 Jump</strong></li>\n<li><strong>X \u2014 Interact</strong></li>\n<li><strong>C \u2014 Grab </strong></li>\n<li><strong>SHIFT \u2014 Use lamp</strong></li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5d/d5d88c6e1eff558a95ae3666f0c30953.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["\u0299\u1d0d\u0299\u1d04\u0280\u1d04\u1d0b\u0280"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
