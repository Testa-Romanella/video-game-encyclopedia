The gameplay is similar to Nuclear Throne.</p>\n<p>Your mission is simple and somewhat expected: kill all the enemies to open a portal to go to the next stage. Lose all your health, and you `ll have to start over.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first prototype made in Godot, so expect some bugs. Not sure if I`ll continue with this game in the nearly future.<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you like it !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T07:16:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbb/cbb29bf931dc65d29746daab13ff06c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rober Baca"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
