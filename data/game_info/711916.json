Known by their friends as Beccalia, they travel to distant lands together, though each for their own reasons.<br/></p>\n<p>Join them in this adventure, a prologue where you get to know who they are and what they can do. You'll get to meet Becca and Rosalia, gain some insight into their personalities and abilities, and come to love them.</p>\n<p>This is our first foray into the RPG Maker MZ engine, and we sincerely hope you enjoy playing this as much as we enjoyed making it. Let us know on Discord, or consider supporting us on Patreon so we can make more games!</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Details</strong></p>\n<ul><li>This is a fairly short adventure, which should take you around 4 to 6 hours to complete.</li><li>The game is combat heavy - combat starts out relatively easier, but gets a bit more challenging as you progress. You should become familiar with each character's skills as this will help you immensely.</li><li>While most of the environment is not interactable, there are a lot of hidden gems and dialogue bits - we encourage you to try interacting with everything.</li><li>Don't be afraid to explore! There's quite a few hidden areas that you might discover...</li><li>Monsters do not respawn. While you do not necessarily have to kill everything that moves (with a couple of exceptions), we do encourage it. The game is balanced assuming you fight everything.</li><li>Is combat not your thing? Is it too difficult?\u00a0There's a super secret area with some treasure chests that can help you out. Join our Discord server and ask us where to look for that!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Changelog<br/><br/></strong>v1.0.0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Initial release!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T07:24:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac0/ac094760d8c59f404c21ada434f88755.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nhcarrigan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
