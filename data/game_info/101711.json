{"id": 101711, "slug": "claws-of-furry-itch", "name": "Claws of Furry (itch)", "name_original": "Claws of Furry (itch)", "description": "<p>Punch and claw your way through fifty levels of pure mayhem, while honing your Ninja Cat skills, in order to rescue your Master from the evil claws of an unknown enemy. Claws of Furry creates a blend of today's fast pace action with classic arcade Beat'em up badassery. With a leveling system of over 40 skills and multiple modes, from Rogue-like to Arena, it's up to the players how they build their Ninja Cat and what adventure they will follow. Fear not the rogue-like though; the character progress is not lost, since the skills that are unlocked transfer to each new character, making the player's cat stronger in every playthrough. Still you don't like rogue-like? We got you covered, with the Pussycat mode you can play the game with checkpoints in every level, in a classic linear adventure. This will not make it much easier though, fast reflexes and a keen eye are required in order to survive the journey to free your Master. You don't have to take this journey alone though; you can have a group of up to four people in local co-op!</p><p><strong>KICKSTARTER</strong>:\u00a0https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/terahard/claws-of-furry</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b2/1b2dd0c90d784b6998a1d5d30452c64b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Terahard Studios"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
