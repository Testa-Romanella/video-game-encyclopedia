{"id": 846476, "slug": "legend-of-snake", "name": "Legend of Snake", "name_original": "Legend of Snake", "description": "The third game in the Legend series, this game is more complex than Legend of Zero, and a bit more strategic, it has 3 level difficulties and have 6 characters. There are 11 chapters in this game, same as the Legend of Zero. All in all I consider this game to be a improved version of Legend of Zero, and has way more replay value, also included the classic permanent death mode. The game itself it extremely similar to Fire Emblem, you move characters on a grid map and defeat each map to advance to the next map, you can level up the characters and gain new skill and classes. It's an RPG styled game without any story.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T07:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69a/69ab16b7742e3bd07a6c07ce3fee33fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yunkai"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yunkai"], "esrb_rating": null}
