Solve cases via navigating through bullet hell minigames! Find appropiate times to hang out with your peers through their messages on Ribbitter! <br/></p>\n<p>In other words, its a SLICE OF LIFE BULLET HELL!! Yes, we combined two extremely niche genres of games into create one Super niche game. If you like bullet hells, visual novels, and loveable gay characters, this is the game for you.<br/></p>\n<p>There are three possible endings (minus the Game Over end when you fail to manage both aspects of life) and the gameplay is about a 30 minutes long.<br/><br/>Made by the DevRangers (with love) in Phaser for a 5-6 week game project for a class. The game was also invited to the 2018 Sammy Showcase!<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE: Clicking on the game in the titlescreen will launch it to fullscreen mode (but ONLY when you're at the title screen). It is recommended to play through a NMD route in one sitting. If you go to a different tab during the game and come back, you might lose the ability to make inputs to the game. If that happens, try clicking on the small grey borders around the game window (remember you can only access fullscreen mode during the titlescreen).</p>\n\n<p>We had a lot of fun making this game, so if you folks have a lot of fun playing it, that's a huge honor!</p>\n<p>ANOTHER NOTE: This is a work of fiction. Any names, characters, and incidents are either products of the creators' imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events and whatnot are entirely coincidental. We have approximately 0% knowledge of how actual detectives and police officers work and half the script was written in less than a week, please spare us.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/291/29134341e83858b09d0651c30c81fe4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hanmori"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
