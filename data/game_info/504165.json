The theme of the jam was \"Stuck in a Loop\". Inspired by the theme, this game features a player object that moves in a circle on its own. The player will lose health over time, so they must pickup color-matching objects to restore health and avoid opposite color pickups which damage health. The player can change their radius of orbit with shift or space.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:22:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fb/9fb7c2921bee4da53a025a58796abd92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charlie Hall - Ascetic Game Dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
