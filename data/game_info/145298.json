What's there to do?\u00a0Not much, really. Breakfast this, lunch that. There was a rumor going around, though,\u00a0about a place called Relinqua Town that was home to a game of sorts. It was a pit that stretched for miles underground, filled with puzzles and battles. Perhaps not for the faint of heart, but Kirby was really, really bored. And so began a legendary epic, of combat, of lost friends, of jailbreak, of tragic pasts, and of course, the pit.</p>\n<p>At least, that's how I wanted it to go. I was 11 years old, full of hopes, dreams, and RPG Maker 2000 assets. I\u00a0had already made many low-quality games in my life, and this was my biggest project at that point. Nevertheless, I\u00a0didn't actually have experience with game design, or with writing dialogue that was interesting, logical, and correctly spelled. So, as you'd imagine, this game is a bit of a mess.</p>\n<p>This game is a product of how amazingly confident I was\u00a0in my abilities as a kid. It's 200+ maps of plot holes, recycled puzzles, and poorly scaled combat. I\u00a0find it pretty amusing, but your mileage may vary. Either way, after all of these years, it has finally found a home.</p>\n<p>Cool features that you can expect from this game:</p>\n<ul><li>A pit with 100 trials in it</li><li>A town with people in it that you can talk to</li><li>Time system with day/night cycle</li><li>Holidays?</li><li>Battle Tower</li><li>Way more secrets than you would expect, actually</li></ul><p>Originally released in 2006, the game was re-released with additional content in 2008 as \"The Pit of 100 Trials: Ruins of Alph\u00a0Edition\". The release available on this page is almost identical to the\u00a0Ruins of Alph Edition, with only minor edits made to make the game more playable.</p>\n<p>Very few of the assets used in the game actually belong to me. Many are part of the RPG Maker 2000 run-time package, and most of the rest are from\u00a0the Kirby Warrior\u00a0RPG project. Any other unaccounted for assets likely came from other Kirby RM2k games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a6484b662968fa1e234afe1a55e4df3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hatkirby"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
