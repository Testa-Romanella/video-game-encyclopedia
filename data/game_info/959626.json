You control your character in real time to fight the enemies.  The control is similar to Devil may cry, in which stylish combo and fast pace maneuvering are satisfying to do.  You have multiple weapons to switch to all the time and learn new action moves by defeating each boss similar to the Megaman series.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>The World:<br/><br/>Counterclocking takes place in a near-future sci-fi world.  A time that everyone can improve their body or cognitive performance with modification.  Genetic mutation, bionic implants, or even pure robots are everywhere in the game.
