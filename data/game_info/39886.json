But there's so many presents and so little time!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHelp the Santa by finding the correct presents and packing them to the respective sledges. Santa's Workshop is a semi-hidden object game, developing attention skills and memory. Like in every normal HO you have a list of objects to find and a map with those objects located. But things are quite dynamic in a workshop, so the presents keep moving around, sometimes disappearing behind decorations. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are 3 maps available to search through and over 50 different presents to find.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-29T21:42:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/640/640b17de64e418b0b6b004ef8f93bdea.jpg", "website": "http://www.getperplexed.com/santasworkshop.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 17}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Rocket Monster Games", "Getperplexed", "TYB Publishing"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Rocket Monster Games", "Getperplexed", "TYB Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
