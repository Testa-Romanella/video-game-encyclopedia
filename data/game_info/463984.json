The game is a endless runner in which you need to type the word on screen to jump, and sometimes the gravity will invert completely, making the astronaut run on the ceiling.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK GameJam 2020, but unfortunatly we weren't able to upload on time for a few reasons.</p>\n<p>Still, we learned a lot about game design during this project, and it was the first game our team ever created, with pretty much zero experience.<br/>It's super rough around the edges and a little buggy, but we still wanted to upload it anyway, because it was a amazing experience creating it.</p>\n<p>We hope you can enjoy the concept of the game more than the actual gameplay and graphics.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Design and programming: David Brito and Jos\u00e9 Pirangaba<br/>Art: Isaac Braga and Jos\u00e9 Guilherme<br/>SFX: Sound FX - Retro Pack from Unity Asset Store<br/>Music: Melody-loops.com<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:38:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3b/e3badd25d558f587cf86cd5083921b1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Muitxo Bem"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
