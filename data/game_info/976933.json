And all you have to do is to move your <strong>cursor</strong>.<br/><br/>You're controlling \"<strong>Null Sphere+</strong>\", a special probe sent by humanity to find a proper new planet.<br/><br/><br/>There are lots of <strong>enemies</strong> and even a first <strong>boss</strong> you can encounter in the void. Each enemy shape has a specially <strong>adjusted behaviour</strong> and stats to keep the game fresh and exciting. Each enemy shape has <strong>different variations</strong> called \"Champion\" and \"Giant\", these have adjusted stats and can possibly even drop <strong>special upgrades</strong>. You will unlock new enemies and therefore new upgrades as you progress!<br/><br/>Your task as Null Sphere+ is to collect data, while you kill enemy shapes, the \"Planetary Void Allocation Agency\" (the organisation that sent Null Sphere+ into the void) researches new upgrades for your Null Sphere+ in the background.<br/><br/><br/>Collect <strong>upgrades</strong> to get stronger. Each upgrade makes it easier to survive in the void. There are a lot of different upgrade types that you can unlock and collect as you progress. For example: <br/><ul><li> Attack Speed Increase (ASPD+)<br/></li><li> Magnetism<br/></li><li> Homing <br/></li><li> Projectile Count Increase</li></ul>I'm sure that you will find upgrades that you like!<br/><br/>Each upgrade either improves an existing component or even adds a new module to the Null Sphere+. This probe is the only chance for humanity to find new planets to inhabit, so all resources are invested to analyze the data that Null Sphere+ sends. This analyzed data is used to develop new improvements or modules.<br/><br/><br/>It's time to shape the void! <strong>A Void Shaper</strong> features a masterfully <strong>handcrafted soundtrack</strong>, composed by <strong>K1ngKapra</strong>. The soundtrack is a combination of <strong>electronic</strong> and <strong>metal</strong> music.
