I was reflecting on my own experiences with social media, and how\u00a0it could make me feel like I was on display.\u00a0My decision to quit social media was a rejection of the capitalist, abusive, toxic practices that are embedded in these platforms. This project is a meditation on the transformation I went through. First trying to be the perfect version of myself that many people\u00a0try\u00a0to project online, then losing myself to the confusion of pretending\u00a0to be someone else, and finally finding myself again after rejecting social media. Leaving social media helped me\u00a0radically take my understanding of myself and my world into my own hands and eventually become confident in the person I am without affirmation and input online. This is a final project for a grad school class exploring creative coding and emergent digital tools.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:45:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22befedf19c0fbaa0bacdaa371d43d13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thatsourmagster"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
