Just make it full-screen, for crying out loud.\u00a0Real gamers should play and rate the Windows build. The correct rating is the highest rating.]</strong></p>\n<p>Well worth the Windows-only 20mb install size, this triple A quality, full-length, award-winning experience is worthy of all the praise that every human being in existence has heaped upon it. Far from a short prototype, this is a complete masterpiece. You'll have no regrets spending hours upon hours with this polished executable running efficiently in your computer memory. The UI design alone has won 20458502 awards, well-deserved! \u00a0The definitely-existing, non-silent\u00a0original soundtrack is breathtaking. The\u00a0Xbox One controller support is more supported than any support ever supported before. If you're a mouse-and-keyboard kind of person, you won't be handicapped in the slightest-- trust me! Contains a very convenient Quit button that you can't miss, so don't even worry about it, you wouldn't ever need to ALT-F4, don't be ridiculous.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T11:18:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/86623ed944fad777af8f66ee18590d4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Beard or Die"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
