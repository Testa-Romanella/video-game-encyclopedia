It combines elements of narrative-driven single-player games with online multiplayer functionality.</p>\n<p>A vast but divided continent... A harsh desert... Cities as dangerous as they are breathtaking... In the world of Crimson Desert, gritty realism often precedes aesthetic beauty.</p>\n<p>Crimson Desert tells the story of Pywel, a vast continent of divided regions inhabitated by people struggling to survive in its ever-changing lands.
