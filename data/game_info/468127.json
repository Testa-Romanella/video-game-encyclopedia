Pico-8 keyboard controls: Arrow keys for directions, X or V for (X) and Z or C for (O).</p>\n<p>All you have to your name is a fleet of automatic miners with poor controls and tracking\u00a0software.\u00a0You must improve and tune\u00a0your miner ships'\u00a0controls in order to collect more ore from the planets. Your score is the total amount of ore collected.</p>\n<p>Gameplay tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Start in endless mode to learn the controls and mechanics, then try the timed mode to earn a high score in 3 minutes.</li><li>Upgrading the ship maneuverability (maximum thrust and maximum turning)\u00a0is important to make them snappier, but you'll need to readjust your parameters to handle the increased maximum speed.</li><li>Basic miner parameters don't have anything set for counteracting overshoot and orbiting. Start there if you are having trouble getting the ship get close to large\u00a0planets.</li><li>If you find the miners are accelerating too close to the target, or can't catch up to moving targets, try increasing the counteracting overshoot parameter.</li><li>If the miners are orbiting around small targets, but never reaching them, increase the counter orbit or reduce the aim straight parameter.</li><li>Ship costs are based on how much it is to maintain your current fleet, and go down when ships are destroyed by flying offscreen.</li><li>Selecting Clear deletes your current miner path, and Scatter sends the miners to random targets in the path.</li></ul>\n<p>Made for the Game Maker's Toolkit 2020 Game Jam with the theme Out of Control.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e2/9e27b965f623bffa20137835b95e1e1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zulutwo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
