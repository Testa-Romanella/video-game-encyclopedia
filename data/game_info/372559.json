No changes have been made. It is precisely the same game. I only just realized that Itch supported webgl.\u00a0It was made in 5 days (with haste)<br/></p>\n<p>'They see' is a platformer, heavily inspired in the game Celeste Classic, for the Pico 8 (Surely it would also be heavily inspired by the main game, but i haven't played it yet, forgive me). In 'They see', you play in a beautiful world, until you find glasses that help you see reality. With these glasses, you can jump from and to this reality with each dash.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not wanting to make this a speech, i would like to thank all the organizers of the CGJ. This is actually the first game i finish. (And take \"finish\" with a grain of salt, but i'm still proud of it.)</p>\n<p>I hope you like it, and don't find it too infuriating.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Jump with Z</p>\n<p>Dash with X</p>\n<p>Move with Arrows</p>\n<p>The jewels will allow you to dash one more time, regardless if you touched the floor or not.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T06:09:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/7712c10524344bae198e37ac2b97733f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mordell Lang"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
