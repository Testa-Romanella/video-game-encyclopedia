It was a good learning experience on balancing attributes and statistics, as well as getting to know how difficult it is to create a \"perfect\" balance.</p><p>This game is an arena-based \"hack-n-slash\" fighting game where 2 players jump around and try to slash, or shoot at each other until 1 of them reign victorious.</p><p>Wall jump is possible, allowing for all kinds of vertical movement fun.</p><p>The game is mainly made for 2 players. And is best probably not played alone.</p><p>There are 2 versions of this game.</p><p>One is purely combat and is actually the entire game planned in the first place, other is an \"extra\" feature which tried to include a shop into a game (as per assignment requirements within my course), which didn't go so well.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22bdfc6ba0a116df7104521aa7227b4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yjchua90gamedev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
