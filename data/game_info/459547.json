There are currently over 13000 nuclear weapons on this planet of which over 9000 are in military stockpiles. This software should help you answer the question: what will happen if Russia and United States or India and Pakistan use their arsenals?<br/>There are a lot of interlocking systems and processes in a nuclear conflict: the command and control system, locations and movement of forces, weapons delivery systems and humanitarian consequences. By simulating the most relevant of these systems you should be able to tell a credible story about how nuclear conflicts play out and what are the consequences.<br/>The simulation is developed in Unity and will be distributed as a stand-alone application.</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>visualise and calculate effects of nuclear weapons (thermal radiation, overpressure, fallout and mass fires) on a high-density population grid</li><li>visualisation of overpressure, thermal radiation, radiation dose from fallout, areas affected by mass fires, population density and casualties density (prompt radiation is not considered)</li><li>effects from hundreds to thousands of explosions can be calculated and visualised in seconds</li><li>design and place nuclear forces to recreate current, past or future arsenals using an intuitive UI</li><li>create attack plans and conflict scenarios and share them with others</li><li>place yourself, your family and your friends inside the simulation and calculate the probability of your survival</li><li>simulate the dynamics and timing of the conflict and effects of a first strike using a damage model based on CEP and overpressure</li><li>simple production cost model: how many weapons can a country build if it wants to?</li></ul>\n<p>Twitter</p>\n<p>Homepage</p>\n<p>Mods<br/></p>\n<p>Guides<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b8685d950357ee04a4d05123e9d6be40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ivan Stepanov"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
