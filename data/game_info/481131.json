You had a ton of homework to do, but you finished all of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Almost.</strong></p>\n<p>There's one assignment left to do, and it would require several weeks of preparation. There's no way to make it... or is there?</p>\n<p>A long time ago, a boy was assigned the exact same project, and he and his family disappeared several years ago.\u00a0Their house is the scariest part of the village, but it's the only way you can pass the school year.</p>\n<p><strong>You must do it.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Last Assignment</em> is a point 'n' click game inspired by Scriptwelder's Deep Sleep series and the absurdity of childhood and horror stories.
