Try your best to get the highest grade possible! This is the first GameJam I've participated in and I really enjoyed taking part and hope you like it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any feedback is appreciated!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>X - Start and count up</p>\n<p>Z - Count down</p>\n<p>ESC - Quit on score screen<br/></p>\n<p>Update:</p><p>Version 2.0 is now live.</p><p>After some feedback, it seemed people preferred to have the counter only increment when you press the key, and then have to wait until you press it again to repeatedly do so. This therefore allows you to only hit it when you count a window, allowing you to focus on counting rather than making sure the number is correct!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a5349563f61fb3ff159927d894f6ca3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jasonblox6"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
