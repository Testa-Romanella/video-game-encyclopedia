He is attracted by everything that the hand of the giver brings, but this is not enough. His eyes have fallen on the land, where the temples should stand, bringing even more gifts. Your task is to go through all the obstacles and restore justice! At all costs, build as many temples as you can on your way, sanctify the sinful earth, and build a temple again, more temples!<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>The atmosphere of old-school games<br/></li><li>Colorful locations with original design<br/></li><li>It's an acutely social story.</li></ul><br/>Our project is entirely a satirical hyperbola of fighting against common sense (one of the bosses at the level - brain, human consciousness). The plot is inspired by an extremely relevant and burning theme - mass and not always grounded building of the Russian cities by temples (the situation with the square in Yekaterinburg, the Pobeda cinema  in Orel. - Editor's note). We share the civic position of people who are concerned about this trend, and we want to express our support for this project.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb0524d62a193175a8a714f5cea5a465.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dagestan Technology"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dagestan Technology"], "esrb_rating": null}
