Of course using worm holes to your advantage might be the edge you need out in space! I am a full time college student and\u00a0solo dev. who had help from a friend making some assets in this game. A lot of the sprites and all of the audio was provided using free assets on the Unity Store. I really enjoyed making this game and hope you all enjoy!! And of course feedback is welcome!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:10:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/510/5103bb3284f2a4b7053c0ad2905b076f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrMcgibbs"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
