We developed a technology platform that provides real-life simulated training. We have simulated the four most common preventable lethal battlefield injuries. The combination of smart algorithms and the physiology engine provides real-time and medical know-how based feedback. Virtual reality analytics and metrics built into the system give insight into the user's performance effectivity - time spent on interventions, medical tools, and devices used.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T03:00:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22e5355c9f81952555e5a05aa8088eed.jpg", "website": "https://traumasimulator.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Exonicus"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Exonicus"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
