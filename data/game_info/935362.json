It takes everything that we love about boomer shooters: fast paced action, loud weapons, tons of explosions, and a lot of obliterated aliens, all with the rhythm of a metal soundtrack.<br/>It is a game about shooting enemies in the most badass way possible.<br/><br/>The game features a familiar set of weapons: machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, sniper rifle, and freeze gun. While basic, the real power of those weapons comes from switching between them to adapt to every situation, and combining them with the <strong>grappling hook</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shooting aliens is fun, but doing it while flying around using the <strong>grappling hook</strong> is 1000% more badass. It is the real star of Earth's Greatest Defender. Grappling can be done on any part of the levels. You can use it to get the high ground, but you can also use it to move super fast and become an unstoppable alien-killing machine.<h3>Built-in level editor</h3><br/>If shooting aliens isn't your thing (really, it should be), Earth's Greatest Defender also features challenge levels, where the goal will be to use the grappling hook and other movement techniques to reach the final teleporter.<br/><br/>If those levels still aren't enough, Earth's Greatest Defender features a map editor which allows you to create fun arenas in just a few clicks. Create the structure, add a few enemies, test it.<br/>Once your level is cool enough, share it and it might just be featured in the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-20T02:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c98/c983aaf7c75d5b9d0283e87ba898adff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["R\u00e9mi Vansteelandt"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["R\u00e9mi Vansteelandt"], "esrb_rating": null}
