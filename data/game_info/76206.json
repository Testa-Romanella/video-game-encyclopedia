Crawlers. SxS. Free. It goes on and on. Stop reading, just download now!<br/><br/>Offroad Outlaws gives you what you want in an off-road game: Complete control over how you build, setup, and drive your rig, tons of challenges to complete, and multiplayer so you can explore the open-world trails with your friends.<br/><br/>CONTROL<br/>You build your rig the way you want it. You have total control over chassis setup - stiffness, damping, travel, etc... and can even swap to a different type of suspension if you want (want a modern truck with an I-Beam setup in front, and a solid axle in back? No problem.) For vehicle control you're given Tilt, Arrow, or on-screen Steering wheel controls. You choose!<br/><br/>DRIVE<br/>With several maps to choose from you can drive your rig slow across challenging rock routes, or fast over the flat sands of the desert. Want to take a break from the trails? Go play in the stunt park where you can use the ramps to \"test\" your rig's durability.<br/><br/>MULTIPLAYER<br/>Explore the trails with your friends or other players, or battle it out in the capture-the-flag mode! Race up mountains, rock trails, or through rivers with friends!<br/><br/>Note: By joining as an Offroad Outlaws Member, you are agreeing to an auto-renewing monthly subscription plan (unless auto-renew is turned off) that will automatically be charged every month through your iTunes account for $4.99 within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.
