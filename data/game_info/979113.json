Pick two from a choice of three to place in the level. Decide based on the physical connection for where you want to go, and what bounty type has for bounty harvesting. You can also discard tiles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each turn, roll one die per ship. The result is how many connected tiles the ship can travel.<br/>A six allows for teleportation to a settlement. Consider dividing ship responsibilities between harvesting, attacking, and trading.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Settlements house merchants to trade with. They rotate in and out with various trade requirements during play, so don't dawdle! Landing on treasure chests will often reward you with an artifact. These are high-value items that can be traded. Can you discover all of them in the game?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every round you are given two quests you can complete for victory points. They vary in their nature bringing a new sense of mission to your rounds. For example, Harvest Season requires the player to have a yield of a certain size, whilst Treasure Hunter wants the player to collect treasures.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The opponent can block your path, so land on them to take them out. Receive one victory point and a proportion of their bounties for combat. If they attack you, you lose some bounties and a life. Acquire more lives throughout play.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T08:27:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab3c75cdea0fa7249123cab3348fd130.jpg", "website": "http://tinyurl.com/b-o-b-presskit", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cartographic Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Cartographic Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
