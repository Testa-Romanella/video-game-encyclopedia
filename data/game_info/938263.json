A lot of people just believe what they read and don't put in the effort to double check things.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Article on fake news:\u00a0https://www.upworthy.com/she-s-an-expert-at-spotting-fake-news-this-is-what-she-</p>\n<p>I\u2019m hoping this will be a lighthearted way of showing the dangers of believing too heavily in the news without other research. I think the humor comes from the fact that the fake news is about an alien invasion and the dialog from other people looking like an alien language showing that the player believes the news. There's also a screen with a few sprites that look and talk like aliens reinforcing the idea that the player is believing the news. One of the people you can talk to has a different dialog output if the player picks up an item. The item they pick up is influencing the player's thoughts very similar to how the news influences people in real life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T09:05:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e6/9e6612a66f7f8a953ecc3d92a3157b2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kay404"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
