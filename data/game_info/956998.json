Submitted for Bevy Jam #3.<br/></p>\n<p>At the start of each round, you'll be presented with three randomized towers to pick from. Place your tower (while being mindful of the side effect!) then press space to start the next wave. Try to survive as long as possible and claim the top spot on the leaderboard!</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: for the web build bloom had to be disabled and the audio can be a bit stuttery, so consider downloading the native version.</p>\n<p>Also note that the MacOS build is untested, although it should work.<br/></p>\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n<ul><li>Crates\u00a0used:<ul><li>Bevy_jornet - online leaderboard</li><li>Bevy_asset_loader - asset loading</li><li>Bevy_kira_audio - audio</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Sound effects made using JSFXR</li><li>Music made using VCV Rack 2<br/></li></ul>\n\n<p>Source code available here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T17:44:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e65/e65f3f208ef5b0a79a2f3029e7756223.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["louisNivrat"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
