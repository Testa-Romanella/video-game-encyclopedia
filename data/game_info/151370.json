The Prototype is in an really early state and is not really an example for how our game will look or feel like when it is finished because a lot of things are still missing.</p><p><strong>All graphics are still placeholders.</strong><br/></p><p>The Team currently just consists of two people. One doing Code and the other doing the Game Design. It is just a hobby side project for now.</p><p><strong>We are currently still looking for an artist who wants to join us!</strong></p><p>We are open for any feedback or questions and are always happy to get some new ideas to improve our game. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19d/19d8c73d07904ed94e4a506e59ba9133.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BReal Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
