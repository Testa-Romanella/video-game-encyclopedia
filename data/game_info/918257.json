{"id": 918257, "slug": "golden-record-retriever", "name": "Golden Record Retriever", "name_original": "Golden Record Retriever", "description": "Retrieve Golden Records scattered across the universe and save endangered planets!<br/><br/>In Golden Record Retriever, you become a golden retriever named River. You are captured by aliens after your owner sends his Golden Records across the universe. As the records continue to fly in and endanger innocent planets, a space organization called the CSO (Cosmic Security Organization) brings you into space to give you missions to retrieve the records. So you start building your team.<br/><br/>But there is a problem.<br/><strong>The CSO says you should stay in the captain's quarters and your only options are troubled aliens.</strong><br/><br/>You feel stuck and want to go back to Earth? Sorry, you can't. Because the die has been cast.<h3>Combination Of Engine-building And Puzzle-solving</h3><br/>Every time the CSO gives you a new mission, they will tell you where your destination is. It's not just a click away, so you'll have plenty of opportunities to recruit your teammates along the way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each time you recruit a new teammate, you will be given a die that represents the new teammate. And each die has a unique set of skills &amp; abilities(dice sides), but most of their activities add up to leave \"auras\" on the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Auras are used to solve puzzles that are given in each situation. Most of the time, the puzzles require a certain array or number of new auras, while you have a limited number of dice and attempts. So you have to use your dice wisely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Above, there's a \"situation\". A situation consists of \"quests\" and a quest consists of its \"solution(=puzzle)\" and results. You can choose which quest to solve first, but it may not be your choice, because depending on your dice set, some of the quests may be unsolvable. That's why you need to choose your teammates carefully and aim for the best teamwork. Depending on how you build up your team, they can make auras as many as you want or as exactly as you want.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Legacy Board Game Inspired Stories</h3><br/>\u27eaGRR\u27eb is heavily inspired by the legacy board game genre. Each mission follows the roguelike format, but the choices and actions you make will ultimately affect the universe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When visiting a planet to resolve a situation, it's good to go for an easy and quick option. But try to consider other options if they can buy you the planet's favor. Then the planet will remember your warm heart and repay you one day.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, the planets you helped and those you didn't will meet different fates in the great vortex created by the factions of the universe. To make matters worse, as the number of decaying planets increases, your mission may become more difficult to complete.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But don't limit your imagination before you play GRR, because it also includes:<br/><br/><ul><li> 70 characteristic teammates<br/></li><li> 3 destinations<br/></li><li> 200+ visitable planets and countless routes<br/></li><li> 100+ gear items<br/></li><li> Formula deck and story deck</li></ul><br/>\u2609 All names and stories in this game are fictional and have nothing to do with actual events or history.<br/>\u2609 We also apologize for some of the images on this page, as they are in Korean.
