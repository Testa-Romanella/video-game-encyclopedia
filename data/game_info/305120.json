So profoundly ingrained, domestic space has been deemed\r\nimpossible to disembed, where the home as norm has been conflated with\r\nhome as fact, as an unremarkable given. Stultifying \u2018domestic realism\u2019 has\r\nno home on our horizon. Let us set sights on augmented homes of shared\r\nlaboratories, of communal media and technical facilities. The home is ripe\r\nfor spatial transformation as an integral component in any process of feminist futurity. But this cannot stop at the garden gates.
