How convenient, that on the pasture next to many female cows seemingly just waiting for him. So he breaks out and lands on the pasture with an almost infinite number of cows that Hans can make happy. <br/>\r\nBut he has to be careful, besides many items that help him to make the cows happy, Alma the cowherd and her dog Wetzel also wait on the pasture. They are not at all enthusiastic when Hans makes the cows happy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo your goal is to make as many cows as possible happy in the given time, only then will you get to the top of the leaderboard. But not only the time is on your back, you also have to watch out for the cowherd Alma and her dog. If they catch you you lose a life. When the time is up or you have no life, Hans has to leave the pasture and the game is over for you. <br/>\r\nBut there are also many useful items that happen to spawn in the world and support you. A blue pill that makes you happy faster or a mushroom with which you can run faster as well as a heart to get a life back.<br/>\r\nGo on a mission to make as many cows as possible happy.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T02:36:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509e9b69f2e63ab022580434ff06f523.jpg", "website": "https://games.mynika.de", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["myNiKa.de"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["myNiKa.de"], "esrb_rating": null}
