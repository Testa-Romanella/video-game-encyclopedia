It is a playble 3 level demo to showcase the main mechanics and characters. It is not finished and has been on the back burner for a little while.<br/> \u00a0 With your support and generosity you are able to support my game development career. If you like or admire what you see, please think about donating. I would be happy knowing that you guys would want this and support my game development career. \u00a0:)</p><p><strong>\u00a0 Pay what you want. </strong>Even if it's only a dollar, it<strong> will go towards the development </strong>to finish the current game I'm working on. Features I'd like to implement/develop into this: more characters and levels, polished art, and more power mechanics. It would be developed for mobile and PC all at once.</p><p>Thank you!<br/>~Jeffwise</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e1c2451c7aaafc176afe9fd069b932c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Jeffwise"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
