Not the last, but probably the worst.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm really glad I got a chance to work on this game jam and see all the great work people do for the love of it. I\u00a0am a sound designer by trade, but wanted to try making a level. The ironic thing is, I spent 80% on the level and had no time to design any sound. The song that loops through the level is an original from myself and had heaps of fun making it. I\u00a0referenced something I\u00a0heard from Hotline Miami and I am pretty happy with it. I think half of my time was spent learning scripts that go well with this type of game, for example, when my player had to turn around and run in the opposite direction\u00a0I\u00a0needed a script for that. Also when I needed to change states in my animation...Script. Pretty much everything I\u00a0needed to do needed a script.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Parallaxing background is something I learnt from Brackeys YouTube channel and the art work from opengameart.com. The rest of the art assets were from Unity asset store and I got some help from the playground package for things like killing the green one eyed monsters and jumping. I\u00a0know the playground package is geared towards kids but I thought since this was my first go at a game jam I would use it this once. For everything I\u00a0had to learn, I put it down to just hard googling and looking into forums where other people had found an answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm really happy with my first go and I hope you all get a chance to play it even though it is pretty bad and doesn't have an ending state. Please give your feedback to me and please be critical. Here are some of the assets I used that weren't mine down below. If I\u00a0missed something I'm sorry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Scripts from the Unity tutorial\u00a0 page</p>\n<p>- Green Monster -\u00a0bevouliin.com</p>\n<p>- Too Cube Forest - Memo MK2</p>\n<p>- Ninja Sprite Sheet (Free)</p>\n<p>- Unity Particle Effects</p>\n<p>- 2d Mega Pack - Brackeys</p>\n<p>I hope I can do a few more game jams on my own in the future and get better at the basic stuff. I would really like to be on a team as an audio guy, but I would rather get this game dev stuff out of my system first. For the next Jam I will scope it down a little and just do something simple.
