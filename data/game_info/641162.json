Where can I leave my criticism?\r\n<p>The full game will provide more content, which means I'm in dire need of feedback.</p>\n<p>Please leave as much feedback as you can on the forums, and check out the Trello for upcoming updates and progress on the full game. There are a lot of issues, especially in nailing down the 'fun-factor,' hence if the game really isn't fun to play then don't hold back.</p>\r\nWhen will the full version be available?\r\n<p>As soon as I have a definitive answer I'll post it here and everywhere else. For now, when all current cards are in the 'Finished' section on Trello, and I feel that the game is accessible by a large audience, I'll release it. :D\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for visiting, I hope you have a great time exploring the sandbox and spawning tons of NPCs!</p>\n<p>Trello:\u00a0https://trello.com/b/3vJN9VMx/hijackd</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T07:17:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33f/33fa53d64e234631a4fb20f2235cfc18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceMarine2040"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
