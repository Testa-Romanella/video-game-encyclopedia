There are only 3 things you need to know to get started:</p>\n<p>1. Roll the die with WASD</p>\n<p>2. Your goal is to roll your die onto the red square with the correct side facing up.</p>\n<p>3. And you have a limited number of moves per puzzle.</p>\n<p>This was my first time completing a project in Unity. If you'd like to leave some feedback, I'd appreciate it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:32:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abd/abd5ebda54aef6f7cd951e53fdabbd54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TrainDozer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
