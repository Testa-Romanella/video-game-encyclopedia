As LA natives, we've experienced firsthand how\u00a0essential street vendors are\u00a0to the framework of our community. With this game, we wanted to celebrate the different street vendors we encounter everyday, the eloteros, paleteros, taqueros, etc.\u00a0 We hope to diminish harmful perceptions\u00a0that invalidates\u00a0 street vendors as real food business. These perceptions lead to their\u00a0criminalization and limited access to resources as seen in\u00a0the city's handling of street vendors during COVID and long fight for legalized street vending.</p>\n<p>COVID has impacted all of us but the struggles many street vendors face as undocumented and low-income individuals has made them some of the hardest hit. They give so much to the community , but the LA system\u00a0doesn't give them that respect back. But they have and will persevere!\u00a0</p>Team<p>Lead Programmer - Ryan El Khoury\u00a0</p><p>Lead Art - Bryanna Benicia</p><p>--------------------------------------<br/></p><p>DONATE TO PROTECT STREET VENDORS\u00a0</p><p>Street Vendor COVID Emergency Relief Fund<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:21:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/306/3062d463759008e10f562e21a39f2f3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ampersands"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
