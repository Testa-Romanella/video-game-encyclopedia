I made this for Oculus PCVR (<em>Rift-S</em>) but also compatible with other PCVR HMD (<em>Index, VIVE, Pimax, Reverb G2</em>, etc.) via<strong> OpenXR</strong>, or Oculus Quest/Quest2 via <strong>Oculus Link/Air-Link</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Commands keys controller :\u00a0</strong><br/>- <strong>Right-hand controller stick</strong> : teleport movement<br/>- <strong>Left-hand controller stick</strong> : snap rotation<br/>- <strong>Left-hand controller menu button</strong> : game menu <strong>(</strong><strong>Restart game, Exit game)</strong><br/>- <strong>Left/Right trigger button</strong> : activate aim laser pointer<br/>- <strong>Left/Right grip button</strong> : grab/interactive with objects (e.g starfish). <br/>- <strong>F11 keyboard button</strong> : toggle full-screen / windowed mode in preview screen (PC monitor)</p>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br/>- You can do \"<em>starfish boomerang</em>\" attack by grab starfish and throwing it as strong as you can! ;)<br/>- To save your PC resource, you may toggle the preview in your PC Monitor screen to windowed mode (by pressing F11 keyboard button).<br/></p>\n<p>This project is still under development, I'm still work on it from my spare-time during my busy daily jobs. <br/>Therefore, if you like this early state of my interactive VR demo please consider to donate for support me. Your support will make my motivation going stronger ;)<br/> <br/></p>\n<p>Happy gaming and cheers,</p>\n<p>Chris</p>\n<p><em>ps. if you don't have VR HMD and you want to enjoy this scene with any regular flat-screen monitor; you may download the interactive demo (2D version ~ Non-VR edition) from here:</em><br/>https://crubino.itch.io/simple-realistic-underwater-preview</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T16:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c53c26a3f87a84ebcd91a0aedcd4e7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CRubino"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
