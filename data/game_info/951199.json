This release contains the first 4 chapters of the game.\u00a0Early Access information is listed at the bottom of this page.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sam has had a run of bad luck lately. After inadvertantly upsetting their mad scientist roommate, their consciousness is downloaded into a robotic battle maiden known as a S.E.R.A. unit. And yes, they're now a female robotic battle maiden. If that wasn't bad enough, they've now been dragged into a magical dimension known as The Frakk and forced to take part in a civil war between opposing monster girl tribes.</p>\n<p>Being a robotic battle maiden is honestly kind of cool, once you get past the abject humiliation of the whole situation. Being forced to obey the orders of your criminally insane roommate is a bit of a drawback though, as is being forced to refer to her as 'Mistress Ellie' due to some obstructive programming in your new robot body. Will Sam find a way to return to their original human body, or will they be spending the rest of eternity as a glorified appliance?<br/><br/>Features</p>\n<ul><li>A Life-Sim/Visual Novel/RPG hybrid!<br/>\n</li><li>Voiced Combat Sections starring professional Australian voice actors, including Aimee Smith (<em>Freedom Planet</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Smite)</em>, Rhiannon Moushall (<em>Age of Darkness: Final Stand</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>CrisTales</em>) and Allanah Fitzgerald (<em>Kiss Off</em>\u00a0and<em>\u00a0Crush Crush</em>)<br/>\n</li><li>A massive full length story following S.E.R.A.'s adventures in The Frakk that bridges the gap between\u00a0<em>Max's Big Bust - A Captain Nekorai Tale</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Alluna and Brie</em>.<br/>\n</li><li>Dozens of unique enemies across multiple varied biomes.<br/>\n</li><li>Explore The Frakk, which features multiple unique islands with their own shops, activities and battle maps<br/>\n</li><li>Gorgeous character art.

We were able to respond to player feedback, fix bugs and release the story in an episodic format. While we have spent time focusing on game balance, this is a full length RPG and we're very open to player feedback on balance and difficulty. We're also open to feature suggestions and respond to feedback, we made significant improvements to our last two games based on player feedback.\u201d</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u201cApproximately four to six months. We are aiming to release one chapter every four to six weeks.\u201d</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u201cThe Early Access version of the game will be very similar to the final product. The final version will be more polished and the combat system will be more balanced, but all of the game systems such as the dialogue engine, the life simulation system, dungeon exploration and combat are all in a fully functional state.</em><br/><br/><em>The story itself is also complete and this version of the game containts the tutorial and the first four chapters, totalling approximately 12-14hrs of content. Releasing chapters through game updates his gives players an opportunity to theorise story developments on the discussion boards and become involved in the community. The plan for the game is to have 6 chapters in total.\u201d</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>What is the current state of the Early Access version?</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u201cChapter 1 (approximately 2hrs in length) and Chapter 2 (approximately 4hrs in length) are completely finished, and we plan to release each chapter every six to eight weeks. We plan to release 6 chapters in total.</em><br/><br/><em>The dialogue system is fully functional, as is combat, town exploration, dungeons and all of the menus and gameplay features. Each system is polished and an improved version of the same systems in our previous release\u00a0</em>Alluna and Brie<em>.\u201d</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u201cNo.\u201d</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u201cMax's Big Bust 2 added a brand new love interest based on player feedback, and our changes were received extremely positively by the community.
