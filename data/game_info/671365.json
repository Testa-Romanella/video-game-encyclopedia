Confronted with loss, the soldier discovers that he is just a tiny piece on a large board - he decides to face his master and bring down the entire organization.\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Arrows (left and right) -</strong> Movement</p>\n<p><strong>Arrow (up) -</strong> Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button -</strong> Attack</p>\n<p><strong>Middle Mouse Button -</strong> Pause</p>\n<p><strong>Right Mouse Button -</strong> Dash</p>\n\n<p>This was the first game I made in Construct (I usually work in Unity) - I had a class in the Video Games course where the final project was to make a game in about 1 week in Construct. And so Endless Soldier was born - I took care of all the programming and game design and went online to get the art. It was also the first time I made a game without original art and it was really interesting to go back and forth on the Internet trying to find all the art I needed and still try to maintain an artistic and conceptual direction.
