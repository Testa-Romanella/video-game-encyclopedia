Simply hit 'esc' twice to unpause it;</p><p>-After a reset while in the alchemist's house, the player will render on a lower layer and the footsteps sound like he's still inside the house. Go inside the house to fix this.</p><p>I will fix them in future builds but for now I just want you to be aware of them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb6/bb6d8cc8acbfdfc2be5696f8ee6c7228.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ulfrskinn"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
