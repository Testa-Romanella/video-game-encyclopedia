That's right, this is not a RPG by any means, and it's heavily impractical. Why did I make it using that? Well, I don't even know. Ah, that reminds me, if the browser one acts funny, you can download it instead. RPG Maker can be a bit uh... \"Free spirited\" let's say...</p>\n\n<p>LORE:</p>\n<p>Welcome to the thrilling world of HEALTHY SAMURAI. As a HEALTHY SAMURAI, you must commit to the true path of HEALTH. Said path can only be followed by DEVOUT DISCIPLES, by collecting APPLES in a BAG and slaying UNWORTHY TEMPTATIONS in the form of UNHEALTHY FOOD, dropped by MISCHIEVOUS NINJAS, thanks to your TRUSTY KATANA. Only you can guide the HEALTHY SAMURAI in the true path of HEATH.</p>\n<p>Remember, a true HEALTHY SAMURAI will never let FOOD touch the ground, be it HEALTHY or NOT. APPLES in the BAG. UNHEALTHY FOOD, SLAIN. This is the true path of HEALTH.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>SPACE: Start you path to HEALTH.</p>\n<p>LEFT-RIGHT: Position HEALTHY SAMURAI in the path to RIGHTOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>UP: Slay UNHEALTHY FOOD with your TRUSTY KATANA.</p>\n<p>DOWN: Catch APPLES with your BAG.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks:</p>\n<p>Yami-\u00a0RPG Maker MV script to skip the main menu that pops up by default</p>\n<p>Yanfly-\u00a0RPG Maker MV script to map events to keys</p>\n<p>SumRndmDde-\u00a0RPG Maker MV script to preload resources properly.</p>\n<p>Dogpit Discord server - encouragement, feedback, inspiration, etc</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T03:34:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb1/bb18545aed1454e66fa2a1f2d6bbb414.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Mr. Metal Alex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
