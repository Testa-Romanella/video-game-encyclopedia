The capital has been annexed, and the Lifetoll surrounded. If it is not rung before midnight, the dark scourge will finally attain its long-sought victory. As the world's last hope, you must sneak into the stronghold and ring the bell.</p>\n<p>But be wary: fell beasts prowl the Lifetoll's courtyard, blind but keen of hearing. Your safety is not assured until the bell is rung, and you have escaped safely.</p>\n<p>========</p>\n<p>This game is an open-source project made with the Godot Engine for the Godot Wild Jam #16.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Team-JEDI/GodotWildJam16</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-16<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T05:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43f9e75dbcdf7b1164073c87366eed40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JohnGabrielUK", "Merly23", "douglabe", "Inglo Games", "EricRonin", "dishbutt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
