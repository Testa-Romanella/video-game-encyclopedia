Try the endless mode to ultimately challenge your abilities as obstacles become more frequent and the questions get harder.<br/></p>\n<p>There are more than 30 different categories, two playable characters and two different sets of obstacles. Every run is different and levels are built procedurally.</p>\n<p>The desktop version is not monetized and uses the open trivia database:\u00a0https://opentdb.com/\u00a0. It can be played offline and in that case some of the features are not available and it doesn't use said database. The android version does not require an internet connection and does not use the open trivia database. Neither version collects any user data.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T07:29:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/443/4438113a544745d458e192f4c1a2663e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lastra"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
