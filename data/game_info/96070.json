Until now.</p>\n<p>Flicker, or The Flickering Man in a Trench Coat is a game made by 6 people who came together to participate in LDJAM39. It\u2019s a puzzle game that has you follow our unnamed protagonist, who also happens to be the first super villain in this world in his quest to drain a city of its electrical power.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is a puzzle game, and I will briefly explain to you how these puzzles work:</p>\n\n<p>Here is a puzzle board. I will explain several of these pieces to you.</p>\n\n<p>1) The Board</p>\n\n<p>The board is a 10x10 board, each containing 100 holes, and two special holes here<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Every board will have these two points</strong>. These indicate two endpoints for your board. <strong>By connecting these two endpoints with electricity (done by wires), you will pass voltage between the two.</strong></p>\n<p>The escape key will close and reset the board, in case you get stuck!</p>\n\n<p>1.1) Wires</p>\n\n<p>Each wire will add<strong> 5 Voltage</strong> to the path. Each board will contain a few wires already.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some puzzles will allow you to <strong>create your own wires</strong>. If so, wire tokens will show up on the top right side of the screen. They look like this:\u00a0.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>When drawing a wire, you can cancel it mid-drawing by right clicking.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>1.2) Switches</p>\n<p>Some puzzle boards will have switches take place a hole.\u00a0.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the switch is turned right, it will\u00a0<strong>disconnect ALL adjacent wires.</strong> If it is turned left, the wires will be re-connected.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Clicking on them will toggle.</p>\n\n<p>1.3) Voltage Buffers \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>You may see these in a few boards. Simply put, connecting to a buffer will add voltage to your path. The amount added is equal to the number displayed on the buffer.</p>\n\n<p>1.4) Voltage Checks</p>\n<p>You will see these take the place of holes rarely. Voltage checks will block your wire connection unless your connection has accumulated\u00a0<strong>exactly 50V</strong> between the start of the board and the voltage check.</p>\n\n\n<p>2) The Note</p>\n\n<p>Each puzzle scene will also include a note. This note indicates the voltage you MUST obtain in order to complete the puzzle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Therefore, <strong>the objective of this game is create a path with this voltage value that connects the two board endpoints .</strong></p>\n<p>3) The Voltmeter</p>\n\n<p>This instrument will help you calculate the\u00a0<strong>current</strong><strong> voltage</strong> you have between the two board endpoints.</p>\n<p><strong>If no connection is detected, then the voltmeter will display 0.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Miscellaneous:<br/></p>\n<p>1) Just like circuits, this board will only consider shortest paths between points. If there are multiple paths from point A to B, the voltage between A and B is measured by the path with the <strong>smallest</strong>\u00a0voltage.</p>\n<p>2) The game will quit on its own when you pass all five puzzles. Otherwise, Right Ctrl\u00a0+ Q will close out of the game.</p>\n\n<p>Please rate and comment this game! We put in a lot of work into it, and we hope you have fun! Any questions and comments are appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f34/f344e9e587d71a90d5183e27b75fc1ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["johnzli1995"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
