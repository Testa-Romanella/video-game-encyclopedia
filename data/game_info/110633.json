It is an interactive toy... or rather poem... or artwork... It's an interactive textual art generator set in a treehouse. Play around with it!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDrag leaves down and attach them to the tree. Every time you add a leaf, the description of the treehouse grows and changes. The changes are random... aren't they?\r\n</p><p>\n<em>My Secret Hideout</em> has no goal, no score, no trophies. Explore it, or play with it, until you find a result you like. Will your treehouse be simple or complex? Can you guide it? What will you discover inside?\r\n</p><p>\r\nUpdate, Feb 16: The drag action wasn't working right on some Linux browsers. Or maybe it wasn't working right on touchscreen-enabled laptops? Anyway, I've gone over the event code and it should be working better now.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI originally created this toy as an iOS app in 2011. Apple recently removed it from their store (because I never updated it) so I've reconstructed it here as a web app.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f340bfa8f789b6c399bed100af826fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zarf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
