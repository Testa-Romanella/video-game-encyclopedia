It\u2019s a top-down shoot \u2018em up, hearkening back to old arcade and 90s console games with a few modern twists. With procedurally generated waves and upgrades, <strong>no two runs are ever the same</strong>, allowing for countless hours of gameplay. Instead of vague spaceships, you pilot a dragonfly, going against countless hoards of various insectoids.<br/><br/><strong>You\u2019ve been summoned</strong> by the god of Dualism to test your resolve, where everything has been divided into two colored groups- <strong>you\u2019ll need to balance aggressively attacking the opposite color while absorbing similar colored shots to stay alive</strong>. <br/><br/><strong>Dualism is an intense shooter bullet-hell with an advanced upgrade system</strong>. Occasionally you\u2019ll be allowed to open the door to new evolutionary paths, allowing you access to lightning powers, bombs, blasts, diplomacy, and even temporal abilities. Defeat a few enemies and you\u2019ll earn evolutionary upgrades. There are over 80 unique upgrades to select from, and they stack exponentially, meaning you\u2019ll get more and more powerful with each identical upgrade you select.<h3>Dualism Key Features</h3><ul><li><strong>Shoot</strong> your enemies<br/></li><li><strong>Smash </strong>your enemies (with your balls!)<br/></li><li><strong>Electrocute</strong>, <strong>bomb</strong>, <strong>blast</strong>, <strong>poison</strong>, <strong>slow</strong>, and <strong>screw</strong> your enemies<br/></li><li><strong>Absorb</strong> shots of the correct color and unleash a barrage of homing missiles<br/></li><li><strong>Choose</strong> new evolutionary paths each playthrough<br/></li><li><strong>Power-up</strong> with upgrades on those paths<br/></li><li><strong>Get insanely powerful</strong> with upgrades that stack exponentially<br/></li><li><strong>Take on bosses</strong> of crazy capability<br/></li><li><strong>Meditate</strong> on the meaning of existence and your upcoming death</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T02:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52e/52eb4e5ac761c425ffdf9a0a0200f94a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noah Judson"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Ensomari"], "esrb_rating": null}
