You cannot directly shoot enemies; you must first absorb enemy projectiles to charge energy before you can shoot. The higher the energy level the stronger the projectile released (though be careful not to absorb too much). Also, you are vulnerable for 1 second after shooting. Try to survive as long as you can and aim for a high score!</p>\n<p>Check out my other games on Steam - https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Eugene%20Tan%20Jianpeng<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T07:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/760/7600f2b0a398ed08c8613984dc45552e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eugenetanjp"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
