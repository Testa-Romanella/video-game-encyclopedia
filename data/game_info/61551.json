Walk through two worlds inspired by the music, using your controller to explore every corner and discover surprises. Along with animated 3D art, the experience features a full-length music video by award-winning director Mark Pellington. Fire, robots and mythic creatures await you!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe inspiration for this experience came from the classic vinyl album cover. Back in the day, you could look at amazing cover art while listening to the music and get lost in the world of the artist. Now, album art has been reduced to a small digital image. As both musicians and visual artists, Spanking Machine are using VR to bring back cover art in a new way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0e/a0e152624a429a8ecd86723cf79bd201.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/SMachineOFC/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spanking Machine"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Spanking Machine"], "esrb_rating": null}
