{"id": 886947, "slug": "queen-of-minecarts", "name": "Queen of (Mine)Carts", "name_original": "Queen of (Mine)Carts", "description": "<p>I had the idea for this game on Monday whilst out for a walk and contemplating a design consideration on another game I'm working on, and the quick prototype I threw together seemed like fun. Because I was on a weeks vacation and apparently I've forgotten how to relax, I figured I may as well have a go at cranking out something resembling an actual game from it. It's pretty short in terms of the number of actual stages, though if you want to perfectly clear all of them it's somewhat trickier - honestly, the code for this is all pretty simple as I took some pretty half-assed shortcuts in a couple of places, but figuring out properly working stage designs and cart timings such that the stages were neither too easy nor literally impossible ended up taking what I thought would be a short two day project into something I spent a whole week on. It is possible to get through every stage without losing a cart, though - I managed this with a way harsher collision window then what is in the final released.</p>\n<p>Still, though, given this was made in less than a week, it's effectively a development speedrun, so I'd expect there to be a couple of bugs in there somewhere that I failed to spot. Hopefully nothing too gamebreaking, though.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T08:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5b/f5b55f6dc6123634e5f6dfd97edb3923.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["digikerot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
