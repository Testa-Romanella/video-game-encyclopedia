Built deep underground and protected by supernatural and merciless creatures, the catacombs are deadly ground, and all who dared entering them never returned alive.</p>\n<p>Our hero, Zeddy Jones, has determined to recover the treasures hidden in the ten deadly chambers of the catacombs. From an dusty notepad recovered from a past, unlucky explorer, he got some tips for his journey ...</p>\n<p>\"As I write this I observe my imminent doom in the hands of the vicious tomb guardians. For those who find this notes, consider that guardians seem to move following two patterns. Sometimes they pursue you and sometimes they just wander randomnly. Observe them and calculate your move carefully. I wish you have better luck than I had!\"</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to recover all treasures from the ten rooms of the Cursed Catacombs.
