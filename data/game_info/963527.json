You are an outcast, having long lost your family you had nothing to live for until this apocalypse. It is up to you to defend what's left of your life.<br/><br/>Survive up to 100 progressively more challenging rounds in this defensive survival shooter. Upgrade your arsenal and improve your income by killing more zombies. Buy permanent buffs that will make you a zombie killing machine. <br/><br/>Do not let your power make you underestimate your enemies though, for they will grow stronger too with every round. Fight four unique types of zombies. Collect up to ten weapons and place traps during the daytime. Fun yet tactical and involved. Die once and your save file is reset! How long will you last? <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Day night cycle based on rounds. Players will begin at night during round one with only the glock and the knife.

Once the player is ready for the next round, the bed inside the RV can be used to sleep and turn it back to night wherein the next round will start.
