Join everybody's favorite poorly-drawn 8-bit character, Mibibli, as it blasts his way through over 20 crazy and eclectic levels designed to challenge even the fiercest wayward retro warrior. Conquer caves, dance through raves, wander the suburbs, and blow up eggs... travel through time and explore your nightmares along the way! Collect power ups and find the secrets that are scattered throughout this world. Each level has it's own collection of enemies, unique gimmicks, and bizarre characters to meet. Pay heed to their quizzical insights and use it to demolish bosses and ultimately defeat Mibibli's arch-nemesis, Crocodibli!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis unique, colourful, and eccentric game has been described as \"Mega Man\" meets \"Space Funeral.\" The soundtrack was inspired by catchy retro NES tunes, but is interspersed by instrumental oddities. Submersive and subversive, it is truly a gaming experience that will leave a lasting impression on your mind\r\n</p>\n<br/>\r\n\t\t- over 7 bits \r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t- realistic graphics \r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t- sounds AND music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t <br/>\r\n\t\t- grammar errors \r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t- a story that will make you cry\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t- gameplay that will make you cry\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t- Mibibli\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t: @RyanMelmoth\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game is available for free, but for $6.49 you get the game with new extra content, such as a new randomized mode for hardcore players and something for mibimibimibfans (and for cheaters too). If you give a total of $10 then you also get the new extended 51-track soundtrack!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t(If you've previously given the cost of the game or more, then you should be able to now download the paid version without paying again. If you've bought the $10 soundtrack, then you should be able to download both the game and the new expanded soundtrack.)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFor info on the game's extra paid content, plus a list of cheat codes, check here: \r\n\thttp://gamesforweirdpeople.com/mibibli/newversioni...\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43d/43d8bccc53fcfc4bad45e9f11b93b5e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyanMelmoth"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
