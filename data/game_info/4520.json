{"id": 4520, "slug": "alice-madness-returns", "name": "Alice: Madness Returns", "name_original": "Alice: Madness Returns", "description": "<p>This sequel to American McGee&#39;s Alice follows the protagonist, Alice Lidell, as she returns to the dark world of her subconsciousness, the nightmarish version of Lewis Carrol\u2019s Wonderland. After she was released from the psychiatric asylum, Alice moved to the orphanage, where she\u2019s being treated with the use of hypnosis. It doesn&#39;t stop her from descending again into the grotesque realm of disturbing visuals, creepy music, and absurdist logic. She will again meet the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, and many other darker versions of Carrol\u2019s whimsy characters. Her journey through the Wonderland serves as a metaphor for Alice fighting her own madness.<br />\nThe game is played in the third-person view. On her way, Alice will jump the platforms, solve puzzles, and fight enemies. The combat system allows for a seamless flow of attacks, dodges, and combos. Besides her trademark Vorpal Blade, Alice will use other, somewhat surreal weapons, such as Teapot Cannon, Clockwork Bomb, or Pepper Grinder. In the sequel, Alice gains a new ability called Hysteria that can be activated when her health is the lowest.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2011-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-31T15:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0b5/0b5410b1e4b3fb72696dcefbf4f1cf40.jpg", "website": "http://www.ea.com/alice", "rating": 4.01, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 189, "owned": 2125, "beaten": 449, "toplay": 136, "dropped": 223, "playing": 24}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 84, "ratings_count": 538, "suggestions_count": 612, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 543, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Spicy Horse"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
