Only one of you will need the TRICKSTER Full Version, which includes all cards and updates. When he*she creates the game, everyone - including the LITE players - can enjoy the unlimited fun of the game.<br/><br/><br/>Who of your friends knows you best? Who finds out which answer is tricked and which is true? How can you characterize yourself as creatively as possible? Who is the Trickster?<br/><br/>The Trickster game principle:<br/><br/>- All players see an incomplete statement on their smartphone, for example \"If I won the lottery tomorrow, I would be the first...\". <br/><br/>- From the point of view of the trickster, the players must now complete it in such a way that they put themselves in the best possible position and answer as if the trickster had written this answer. <br/><br/>- Once everyone has typed in their answer, the display will show all the suggested solutions, including that of the trickster, which has to be guessed. <br/><br/>- Now each player guesses which of the statements he*she thinks the Trickster has written. Then the game is resolved. <br/><br/>- Points are awarded to any player who has correctly guessed the Trickster's statement. Points are also awarded if the player's own suggestion has been made. The trickster gets points if his answer was guessed by at least one other player.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/0606de898eba3c1e1cbabc7cc62f51bb.jpg", "website": "https://www.flyingpotato.de", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Flying Potato Entertainment"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Flying Potato Entertainment UG haftungsbeschrankt"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
