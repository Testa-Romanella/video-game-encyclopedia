Instead, he bullies the other forest creatures into feeding him their food.</p><p>Of course, you don't want to get too close to him, in case you end up on the menu. So instead you fire the fruit straight into his giant jaws using a makeshift cannon. </p><p>That's not as simple as it sounds, given all the obstacles in the way. </p><p>But using movable objects and a variety of helpful animals, you can always find a way of feeding King Bear. </p><p>You'll get help from the chameleon's long tongue, swinging monkeys and spiky hedgehogs. </p><p>And each fruit behaves differently in flight \u2013 so getting a whole melon into the King's mouth is a mighty feat. </p><p>Challenging physics-based gameplay and riotous humour means that once you've played Feed the Bear, you can't bear to be without it!</p><p><strong>Game Features</strong> </p><ul><li>Hilarious cartoon graphics</li><li>90 levels</li><li>Brain-teasing puzzles to solve</li><li>Quirky music and sound effects</li><li>Familiar, intuitive controls</li><li>In-game achievements</li></ul><p>____________________________________</p><p>FOLLOW US: @Herocraft<br/>WATCH US: youtube.com/herocraft<br/>LIKE US: facebook.com/herocraft.games<br/>You can also reach us at support@herocraft.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7d/a7d7aa1053c4ef92872a1dfa3b06c94a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["HeroCraft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
