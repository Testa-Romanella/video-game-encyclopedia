You have until the moon disappears to prove your strength.<br/></p>\n<p>Your spells and maneuvers take time to prepare - whatever action you choose only takes effect as the moon's phase changes (every 2 seconds).</p>\n<ul><li>Player 1 Controls: WASD\u00a0</li><li>Player 2 Controls: Arrow Keys</li></ul>\n\n<p>The game doesn't explain much of anything - kinda like the nonsense fighting games that inspired me. If you prefer having some guidance:</p>\n<p>Actions:</p>\n<ul><li>Charge (up) - Increase the strength of your future attacks. The more full the moon is, the more your power increases.</li><li>Attack (right) - Damage your opponent according to your accumulated charge</li><li>Daze (down)\u00a0 - Slightly damage your opponent and remove their charge. Fails if struck by an opponent's attack.</li><li>Block (left) - Reduce damage received from attacks by half (rounded down).</li></ul>\n<p>Actions cannot be repeated twice in a row. If no action is selected by the time the moon changes phases you do nothing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T12:18:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8eb/8eb393be74262b9df3219b7933816bc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sbumgardner"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
