Upgrade your ships unlock capabilities and push against difficult design. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne or two player game with both players being on the same screen. Think of the old arcade top down shooters. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are a total of ten ships, you can select one of the first four when you start a new game after that the other nine can be rescued during missions. <br/>\r\nShip 1 can be rescued in mission 1 ship 2 in mission 2 etc. <br/>\r\nThere are eleven researchers that can be rescued, they unlock upgrade research that goes across all the ships.<br/>\r\n- Speed, Fire Power, Fire Rate, Missiles, Bombs etc. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI am designing the game so that the end missions will be close to impossible with out upgrading the capabilities of your ships.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- During beta testing mission 2, it drove me crazy because I designed it's difficulty to really push the player from what they experienced on mission 1.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame is progress based once you beat mission 1 you get access to mission 2 etc, but secret missions 1 2 and 3 will require conditions to be met, such as beat mission 5 with out taking any red health damage.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T04:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/646/646d5aa22e5dc19696aff02a5495da92.jpg", "website": "https://initialnode.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Initial Node"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Initial Node"], "esrb_rating": null}
