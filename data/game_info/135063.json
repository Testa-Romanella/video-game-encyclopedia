If they are correct, the accused turns over their card and is out of the game.  If they are incorrect, the accuser turns over their card and is out of the game.  You can make as many accusations as you would like while holding the phone, but you have to keep talking or set the phone down.</p><p>(Tap and hold for 2 seconds to enter new identities without re-entering everybody's name.)</p><p>I highly recommend you play this with a phone at a table with people, but you can also use a computer or use the in-browser version and tell everybody to close their eyes when you enter the secret identities.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f3/9f308f1e14fb2fdc5a2673c5113eacbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["grandtheftmarmot"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
