I\u00a0wanted to showcase these capabilities (and a few others)\u00a0so more people could be aware of them.</p>\n<p>I also pieced together a mod for Bitsy that has these dialog hacks as native parts of the Bitsy Game Maker (such that they can be implemented and previewed in the editor).\u00a0</p><p>This mod also features a 'timer' system that can be used to call the dialog function/hacks based on time. Fun for creating little 'animated\u00a0cutscenes.'</p><p>That mod can be found here.\u00a0<strong>(download editor.zip, unpack, run index.html in Firefox)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This example game can also be downloaded from the above link.</p>\n<p>Do feel free to let me know if you run into any issues using it.\u00a0Thanks very much &lt;3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27c/27c1d6b3b593bbd68ac3e3248264af5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JackTrick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
