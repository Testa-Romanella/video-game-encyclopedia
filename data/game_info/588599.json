Solve the mystery of the missing amulet in this visual novel!</p>\n<p>Known bugs</p>\n<ul><li>Occasionally, the game crashes. I haven't been able to figure that one out but it does seem more likely to happen if you go through the dialogue really quickly.</li><li>If the game crashes or is otherwise in an unplayable state, just quit and reopen and you should be fine. There aren't any\u00a0important variables to save, so you're not really missing anything.</li><li>Note that the \"skip\" button is a toggle: while it is enabled it will skip through dialogue. So make sure to turn it back off when you are done skipping.</li><li>The game has \"Accessibility mode\" to read items on mouseover. This is supposed to be turned on by default, but it looks like it doesn't turn on until you open the preferences menu. Sorry to anyone who can't see and therefore can't open the menu. Anyone who wants the accessibility option off can turn it off in the menu.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e94/e948abc1813ee94235971e5b3297c5fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["cmd16"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
