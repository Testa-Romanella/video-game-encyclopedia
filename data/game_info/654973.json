This was my 7th Amiga game,\u00a0originally released in September 1992.</p>\n<p>Roton is a simple Asteroids-like game with the innovation of mouse control. Move the mouse right to rotate clockwise, and left for anticlockwise. Surreal enemies\u00a0appear in increasing speed and quantity. I re-used this game dynamic many times. First in\u00a0Xenex (1994), then Outliner (1996), and on PC with Roton (1999), Gunstorm (2005), and\u00a0Gunstorm II (2006). The highly reactive control scheme was also used in my most popular PC game, Flatspace.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T15:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e286df3e54e76e6f09ed7ce1ad6eac1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
