You take two hits and the game restarts. You can use purple chaos magic to damage the Boss. Hit him 10 times and you win.<br/></p>\n<p>Didn't have time to add a background, the main menu, a pause option/screen, a win screen, a loose screen, the Boss' dynamic eyes and arm placement, and more interesting attacks.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in 8+h over the course of a day as a part of my own declared challenge: One Day Jam.
