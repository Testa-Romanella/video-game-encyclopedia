Though, as the player assumes a direct control over such a pawn, nothing of the surrounding lore is shown, and this is exactly the author's intent. You decide the fates, but don't see anything actually going on. Imagine your purpose is just to simulate a human's decision making system, in a lack of information beyond the spreadsheet numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey features:<br/>\r\n- Micro-sandbox gameplay;<br/>\r\n- Set of 3 text screens, one of them is interactive;<br/>\r\n- In that screen you have 3 commands, one of which is the game exit;<br/>\r\n- Console interface reminiscent of retro operating systems;<br/>\r\n- Cryptic symbols in the background;<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you wonder what this should play like, it should play like a zero-player game which doesn't even play itself. Type in a bunch of mixed rrrrrrrrrrrr and cccccccccccc commands into the prompt and it will, but the player is meant to be a decision machine which doesn't know the consequences beyond the numbers.
