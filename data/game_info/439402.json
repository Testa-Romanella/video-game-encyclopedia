The scope of\u00a0<em>S2HD</em>\u00a0has increased since it's inception (originally intended as a straight vector redraw of the original shapes and colours), with artists and animators taking liberties with additional detail, animations, effects, and storytelling elements. S2HD then ceased production earlier that year, after one of the programmers, LOst entered a Keylogger into the game. But now, relive the magic of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 HD once again in this all new, 3rd demo! I was on the S2HD team as a developer and beta tester.\u00a0We had planned to release a third demo, but never got the chance as the project shut down. Now, finally relive the third demo, rebuilt, recreated, and Keylogger free! It is still in development though, but we'll make sure to add to the Develog as soon as we can! Remember, this will hit early access soon! By the way, if you want to say \"WHhen will the full game release!?\" Or, \"FINISH IT!! FINISH IT!!\" Well, remember that it is STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, and not only that, but it is a lot of work.\u00a0We are redrawing, reanimating, and rebuilding the abandoned and forgotten demo for your enjoyment once again!\u00a0(P.S There's a way to get to Metropolis Zone in this version! Try figure out how!)\u00a0We are proud to present the long-awaited release of Sonic 2 HD Demo 2.0. From the bottom of our hearts, we want to thank you for taking interest in the game, whether you have followed our development from the very beginning or just heard about our project today. We are truly humbled by your support!</p>\n<p>Available Features and Zones<br/></p>\n\r\nCheck out Sonic and Tails' new look!\r\nPlay as Sonic and Tails\r\n<p>\u00a0Sonic and Tails are back!
