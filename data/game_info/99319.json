Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, becomes the starting point of a compelling investigation exploring the lives of journalists, shop owners, community workers, and urban refugees. Players experience these real stories through a fictitious character: a mother, searching for her missing daughter who worked in this region for many years. Through her eyes we can interact with street children, politicians, doctors, NGO workers, restaurant owners, and refugees, who share their insights in interactive interviews.</p><p>FROM DARKNESS is based on extensive research in Kenya and Uganda, conducted in close co-operation with African NGOs and many dozens of interviewees. With their help, the artists gathered over 60 hours of interview and video footage, producing an intense interactive documentary experience. The innovative, hauntingly beautiful, multi-layered visual concept mirrors the idea of uncovering various layers of information. It is based on collage techniques, combining original video footage, pictures, and sound into a multi-dimensional environment.</p><p>The subjects of this project are the ongoing \"resource wars\" in Eastern and Central Africa; the current circumstances of urban refugees; and stories of daily life from local communities and groups of refugees. For the latter a special light was put on the Banyamulenge, a Congolese people who have been brutally displaced and are coping with the challenges of exile.</p><p>Interactive documentaries are a significant new medium within the genre of transmedia storytelling. FROM DARKNESS opens up new perspectives and creates a walkable piece of art. Viewers and players can explore and uncover layers of stories, memories, political contexts and dreams. </p><p>gold extra's concept of the interactive documentary was awarded the \u201eMedia Art Award\" of the state of Salzburg in 2012.<br/></p><em> \"An intriguing blend, featuring interesting subject matter, and a wonderfully fresh method of delivery\"</em> - PCGamer.com<p><em>\"What's striking about the environments in From Darkness is how they are constructed through collage.\"</em> - Killscreen.com </p><p><strong>A documentary experience by gold extra</strong></p><p>Concept, production, lead design: Reinhold Bidner, Tobias Hammerle, Georg Hobmeier, Sonja Prlic, Karl Zechenter.<br/> Programming and design: Andreas Leitner, Martin Porocnik, Victor Morales.</p><p>Voice acting: Lisa Nielsen-Spieler.</p><p>Research Partners in Kenya: Susi Kerschbaumer, Titus Mwangi<br/> Research help from Kituo Cha Sheria, AMREF, Mathare Children's Fund Panairobi, Refugee Law Project, GIZ, German Doctors (Baraka), Austrian embassy Uganda, UNHCR</p><p>Supported by Austrian Development Agency<br/></p><p>Official Download Link &amp; Reviews:</p><p>www.fromdarkness.net</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe5/fe5ba346e5467c2589bf5f352e105fb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["gold extra"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
