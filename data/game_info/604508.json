Show your slime\u00a0direction to jump, feed him with Heatfruit or Freezeberry, analyse level structure and watch how dangerous devices slowly wipes out from existence.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse left - Jump/Drag fruit</li><li>Mouse right - Stomp (Quick fall)</li><li>R - Restart level (level restarts only when you release button, if you pressed button on accident you can hold Ctrl and only then release R, that will make restart\u00a0cancel)</li></ul>\n<p>Things I want to share</p>\n<p>I didn't talk to other jam members a lot this week, because I was\u00a0afraid I could make a lot of grammar mistakes and no one will understand me, but I want to share some (maybe) usefull advices that I come up with during this game jam.</p>\n<ol><li>Making simple sprites using vector graphics editor and then exporting them as PNG\u00a0has proven to be usefull, because you can resize your image anytime without loosing even a single pixel of\u00a0quality (and because of that you can easily\u00a0make gigantic versions of objects in your game) and it, in my opinion, faster and easier than drawing them in other ways.</li><li>If game is simple and not plot-oriented, you can make tutorial and other staff using images, without text. It will make game suited for people from other countries, even if they don't know English.</li><li>You can make your game\u00a0logo on itch.io animated with .gif, and if you don't have time to make animation, you can make \"animation\" with some gameplay (on background behind logo or even a special level with logo as part of it)</li></ol>\n<p>Also I will share Construct 2 project file of this game, so you can see how some things was implemented. I tried to make code as change-friendly as I can.</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<ul><li>Game made with Construct 2 engine</li><li>Graphics made with Boxy SVG editor</li><li>Sound effects obtained from\u00a0Zapsplat.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T05:58:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/709/709bb428e5a655cc2df24697e3ae75f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["OctoNeko"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
