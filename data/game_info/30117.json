The story centers on Miette, an orphan who lives in a local orphanage. Unfortunately, the evil pair of Siamese twins who run the home force Miette to perform various tasks for them; most of the time, the twins want her to steal things. While this may not been an ideal situation for a little girl, Miette is relatively safe. Suddenly, a dark presence appears and starts to steal children&#39;s souls and dreams. Now, Miette must find out who or what is responsible and try to find the lost children. You, as Miette, will use a point-and-click interface to solve puzzles while exploring environments that look like they were pulled from the movie.
