{"id": 398298, "slug": "psycho-aidenstudios", "name": "PSYCHO (aidenstudios)", "name_original": "PSYCHO (aidenstudios)", "description": "<p>A brief recreation/simulation of a fairly severe psychotic episode akin to one experienced by someone with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or any other psychotic personality disorder. This simulation obviously only recreates symptoms experienced by one specific person (the developer)- other people with psychosis may experience completely different ones. Hallucinations, whether they're visual, auditory, or tactile, can present themselves in an infinite number of different forms that can be incomprehensible to others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I can't quite fully convey what delusion exactly feels like, since I don't think the feeling can even be described in words, but this seems somewhat accurate for me. Just try to imagine genuinely not being able to tell which of the things you see and hear are real and which aren't. Imagine your brain convincing and fully manipulating\u00a0you into believing that the things you can logically identify as hallucinations now are actually part of your reality,\u00a0and that\u00a0you have no reason to even doubt that.</p>\n<p>There is no goal in the game besides walking around and experiencing the episode. The longer you play, the worse it gets. It will never end, the only way to win or lose is by quitting.</p>\n<p><strong>OBVIOUS TRIGGER WARNING FOR PSYCHOSIS, HALLUCINATIONS, PARANOIA</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Have fun.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W,\u00a0A, S, D - Move</p>\n<p>Shift - Sprint</p>\n<p>Best experienced with headphones in, inside of a dark room.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T05:19:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc6/bc6ad2359b601c3beee81c31b1b6909c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aidenstudios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
