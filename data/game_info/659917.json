This game is a simple tribute to the infamous and daunting platformer, Getting Over It with Bennett with Foddy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game you inexplicably find yourself on what appears to be a foreign planet, and have to keep moving forward to try and locate the special object at the very end of what seems like an impossible journey. The bottom half of your body is still caught in your flying space disc so walking is out of the question. Likely the air is breathable and your trusty Ray-Globe is still working perfectly - or, well at least it is working.</p>\r\nI SERIOUSLY hate this game!!<br/>- Michael Cavaleri\r\n<p>You <strong>will</strong> question your sanity, you <strong>will</strong> become very angry, you <strong>will</strong> hate this game and you <strong>will most likely</strong> rage quit and never return. But I promise you, this game <strong>can be beaten</strong> and the secret prize is well worth all those hours of headache.</p>\n<p>This game is produced in less than 48 hours, which leads many things wanting. I however hope you still enjoy the experience. Have fun!</p>\n<p>- Michael<br/></p>\n\r\nThe Kenney Jam 2021 theme is 'Rotation'.\r\n\n<p><strong>Graphics:</strong><br/>https://kenney.nl/assets<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Ambience:</strong><br/>https://freesound.org/people/Sonicfreak/sounds/174450/</p>\n<p><strong>Sound effects:</strong><br/>https://freesound.org/people/brandondelehoy/sounds/494797/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/yottasounds/sounds/380145/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/newagesoup/sounds/344534/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T15:13:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c4/6c43ee60cd5e3ff2d1ad66d5bcb96312.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cavaleri"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
