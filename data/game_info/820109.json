P.S shoot the dice for a\u00a0\u00a0chance to win a lot of money and points and watch out for the ghost targets they will take two hits to break. This game is inspired by both my game Protector\u00a0and another game I like called Sharp Shooter.\u00a0I also got some of the sound effects from\u00a0Incompetech-Music, so I recommend you check out\u00a0their website (Check Notes &amp; Credits for more).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T22:35:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9ad352026c9a77d1932f1f4aa9e2ad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nxgamesco"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
