It will have a lot of mechanics that are found in VR games that are too expensive.\u00a0\u00a0Playtest various mechanics that I will develop along with levels. What started out as a Survival game turned into a target shooting game. I have climbing mechanics and other mechanics already built. I will release them in the future once I polish the shooting mechanics.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa4aff03f899cfa339af2beb441ca053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ToastyPlanetGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
