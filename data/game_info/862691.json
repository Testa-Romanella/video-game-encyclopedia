That\u2019s the easy goal of this first person runner. A fully cycle takes 10 seconds. Every cycle consists of 2 phases. A red phase and a blue phase. Many game elements are only usable in one phase. Targets in the game give you some points for your score. If you do not increase your score over the time of a full cycle you will start to lose health. Run and warp your way through 4 - or maybe 5 - levels.</p>\n<p>Made with Godot 3.5\u00a0 for Ludum Dare 51 Jam<br/><br/>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD -&gt; Move<br/>Space -&gt; Jump<br/>Left Click -&gt; Shoot<br/>R -&gt; respawn at last checkpoint<br/>Esc -&gt; Pause and free mouse<br/><br/>Controller works but you need the mouse to use the menus I think<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Everything: IamDevNull https://www.twitch.tv/iamdevnull<br/>Also Everything: Cammymoop https://cammymoop.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T16:02:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f86/f86a82b8f73f40e5d9734d5e604ded25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Cammymoop"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
