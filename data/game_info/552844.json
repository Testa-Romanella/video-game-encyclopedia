The bombs will destroy the ground and 2 other bombs will appear. The less ground you have left, the more points you get, the faster you move.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Pixel art, music, sound effects and coding by SxAde.</p><p><strong>Publishing update (20-Jan-2021):</strong></p><p>The WebGL version works just fine but I wanted to also include the stand-alone version for Windows after the submission\u00a0just in case.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:36:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40c/40cec7194545482ca20680a7e6b46e14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SxAde"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
