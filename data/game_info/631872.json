The subject aimed to teach us the fundamentals of Unreal Engine 4 with a large core use in C++ and Blueprints (Unreal Engines built-in Visual Scripting).\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were 3 components of this assignment:</p>\n<ol><li><em>Improving on AI Functionality</em><ol><li>I improved on a Finite State Machine that allowed the AI to navigate around the map to locations that would store 'Ammo' or 'Health Potions'.</li></ol></li><li><em>Improving on Procedurally Generated Content</em><ol><li>I expanded on the AI Functionality and implemented a physical potion that was randomly spawning\u00a0as well as containing procedurally generated statistics.</li></ol></li><li><em>Polish and Networked Multiplayer</em><ol><li>For the polish, I was required to move over the entire project into a multiplayer capable game that would require local networking. This would allow for Player 1 to host a game, with local players 2, 3 or 4 able to join the game as well</li><li>I also implemented a general feedback into the game so that when the player would be hit, they didn't have to rely on the vision of their health bar to determine their exact amount of health, but rather a overlay on the screen would appear to indicate severity of health</li></ol></li></ol>\n<p>As this was completed in a group, my partner had also implemented functionality for each components of the assignment in such a way that would coincide with what I had implemented</p>\r\nCredits:<p>This project was created by Jake &amp; Jonah</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:57:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbe/bbe78d27f9d8ce2a8f7d4ded0f8ae8cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garnet"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
