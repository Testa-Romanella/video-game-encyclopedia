It is finally getting closer to being content complete as well! Ideally at this stage (if not earlier) I would have wanted to have this functioning on mobile devices, but unfortunately I made a pretty big structural mistake in my code early on in development that would make the game very time consuming to scale to different devices without redoing a large portion if my existing work. That being said, I\u2019m going to keep things in browser for the sake of finishing out production and think about revisiting mobile compatibility and scaling in the future on my own time.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T04:03:16", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Haley Nicole Phillips"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
