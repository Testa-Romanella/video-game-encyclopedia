It's something I may come back to with an update or patch to make it higher quality. I really appreciate the support of my friends and family during the making of this game and thanks to the Extra\u00a0Credits team for having me! I'm likely to make a Quest port in the near future, I'm currently struggling due to my inexperience there.</p>\n\n<p>The game is made in Unity, with almost all assets being mine or from wii sports, in an attempt to emulate the experience. Quite a few ideas had been discussed for this game, such as seeing characters known as \"pill boys\" bowling alongside you or the idea of a online scoreboard, but in the end, for my own first venture into VR and in the short amount of time I spent working on the game directly, I'm quite happy with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:12:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cc/7cccb2a5988e98f220f47ad2612fe516.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Port'sNotAlt"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
