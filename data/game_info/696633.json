A main part of Castle Crashers involves progressing through the map and then battling sections within the map, so I thought it might be interesting to show this by having the player at first controlled very similarly to how they are controlled on the map, and then change in perspective to be smaller as they are \"warped\" onto the battlefield, surrounded by other knights (as the game is best enjoyed in multiplayer). I chose to represent this as a fun little chessboard, with the pieces moving up to attack the castle, which follows the simplistic style of the board. The abilities of the pieces originally used colors closer to the actual game, but I decided to instead make them only use the colors of the other pieces to reduce colors used total.\u00a0I did, however, add colors for the pink knight, who's abilities typically stand out in the game as much more colorful than anything else.<br/><br/>Music tracks used from Castle Crashers, in order, are:<br/>Flutey (World Map) - The Behemoth<br/>Four Brave Champions - David Orr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T08:08:51", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pinkpi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
