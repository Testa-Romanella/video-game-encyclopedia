Three players. No more, no less. You cannot play SenSense alone. Don't have two friends handy? No problem! You don't need to be in the same physical location, you just need visual and audio contact. Connect via group video chat on another device and you're good to go. <br/>(Still looking for players? Try dropping a message on the Facebook page\u2026 maybe someone will respond.)<br/><br/>Escape-room-inspired:<br/>Without the room! SenSense does not try to copy a physical room in any way. Rather, it focuses on the multiplayer and puzzle solving aspects of an escape game: you get to feel the manic shared energy as you race the clock to piece together clues, in search of those satisfying \"aha\" moments when everything clicks into place.<br/><br/>Puzzle game:<br/>SenSense is a series of multiplayer challenges. In each challenge, each player will receive a different piece of the same puzzle. You will need to work together to solve it. Each of you is essential to the solution.<br/><br/>Oh, and one last thing\u2026 one of you will be deaf; one of you will be blind; one of you may not speak.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:20:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f14/f1442059046aa199c00fb82c65287281_NA4dUci.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Just So"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["JG Southey"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
