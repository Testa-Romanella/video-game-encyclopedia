Gain speed by wall jumping, sliding on slopes, and generate structures around you to help you reach new heights in this abstract, recursive environment.</p>\n<p>The game has no precise goal - it's all about combining your different abilities to never stop moving, reach ludicrous speeds and create paths to reach any spot on the map. Your sessions will be accompanied by hypnotic visual effects and an intense techno soundtrack that will evolve as your speed changes.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>GamePad</strong><strong>Keyboard/Mouse</strong>MoveLeft joystickWASDLookRight joystickMouse mouvementJumpCrossSpacebarSlideCircleCtrlSpawn wall to the leftL1Mouse left clickSpawn\u00a0wall to the rightR1Mouse right clickSpawn downward slopeR2ESpawn upward slopeL2QPauseStartEsc\r\nThe Team\r\n<p><strong>Matthieu \"Matt-Rhu\" Alle</strong><br/><em>Lead Designer, Art Director</em></p>\n<p><strong>bocxyz</strong><br/><em>Lead Developer, Music Composer</em></p>\n<p><strong>Andrew \"Kahnetop\" Jacques</strong><br/><em>3D Artist, Developer</em></p>\n<p><strong>Edward \"AKSIS\" Bot</strong><br/><em>Sound Designer, UI Developer</em></p>\r\nLinks\r\n<p><strong>Listen to the soundtrack</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T10:47:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53b/53b930413467f5c2ee976c8df6348212.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Kahnetop", "AKSIS", "Matt - Rhu", "bocxyz"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
