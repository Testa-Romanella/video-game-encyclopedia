Try to find one that works for you!</p>\n<p>We are still working on adding a character with  fighting game commands, a character that uses a mouse instead of a controller, platformer sections, and the list goes on (It's also meant to have a separated story mode told in a visual novel style, but that's not done yet).</p>\n\n<p>Designed to be very easy to play, and it's possible to beat the only stage we have so far with the slowest character (Bullet Supernova) without shooting and without taking any damage.</p>\n<p>Garudoh is still indevelopment, and on it`s \"2nd Gear\" state and everything is placeholder.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p><p>WASD: movement / navigation<br/>J: Fire1 / Choose<br/>K: Fire2 / Cancel<br/>(Viper Stingray has a Fire1 + Fire2 variant)<br/>L: Ultimate<br/>O:\u00a0 Extra / Speed change<br/>Spacebar: Taunt</p><p>After you beat the \"Grayzone 68\" stage, you will unlock \"O.L.D.M.A.N.\" as a playable character.</p><p>If you are interested in this project, please consider answering this form to help us out!
