The royal palace\u2019s smoky dining hall resounded in cheery voices. To one side of the top table a harpist and a minstrel were struggling to be heard above the commotion caused by two dogs snarling over a bone in the corner.<br/><br/>Eating slowly, I leant forward to catch the breathless whisper of a rival knight.<br/><br/>\u201cThey came in at a run, baying like wolves, four wild-eyed barbarians ready to cut, gouge, pulverize and kill anything that moved.\u201d <br/><br/>That news was indeed music to my ears.
