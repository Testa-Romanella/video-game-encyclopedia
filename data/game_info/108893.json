You control a cyborg secret agent infiltrating a series of increasingly well defended alien robotroid bases. You must fight to survive, navigate through darkness, and replenish your oxygen supply while facing killer robots, evil agents, and insidious alien overlords in a fast-paced paranoid bullet-hell game inspired by Berzerk, Dark Cavern, and Space Panic.</p><p><strong>NEW! May 28, 2016: version 2.5! With the following changes:</strong></p><ul><li>Security stations fight back by firing sprays of bullets.</li><li>Touching the walls drains your oxygen instead of causing instadeath.</li><li>Fixed bug where barriers could still kill invincible player at level start.</li></ul><strong>Features both local co-op and client/server network co-op. (The network play code is still in beta and you may experience glitches. Please report issues to me at dto@xelf.me)</strong><p><strong>FUTURE PLANS:</strong></p><ul><li>Expanded optional megaquest with 100 levels</li><li>More crazy robots with better AI</li></ul><p><strong>PLAYING TIPS:</strong></p><ul><li>Hold the fire button (or SHIFT key) to <strong>lock the firing direction</strong> while moving independently. Use this when firing at a group of enemies, or trying to sweep a line of bullets across an enemy's path. Especially effective with Rapid Fire powerup.</li><li>Stay out of the screen's corners --- you'll get cornered.</li><li>Save oxygen tanks that appear early, so as to maximize the benefit of refill.</li><li>Don't touch the walls.</li><li>Don't rush into enemy groups. Peck around the edges instead.</li></ul>Visit the DevLog and give feedback here: https://itch.io/t/23021/inv8r-you-versus-the-robot...<p>I'm making this in Common Lisp for the current #LispGameJam! https://itch.io/jam/spring-2016-lisp-game-jam</p>This is a work in progress.
