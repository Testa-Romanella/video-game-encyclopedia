Build &amp; manage your own graveyard while finding shortcuts to cut costs, expand into entertainment with witch-burning festivals, and scare nearby villagers into attending church. This is a game of capitalism and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business.</p>\n<p>Face ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper hotdog meat for the festival when you have so many resources lying around?</p>\n<p>Gather valuable resources &amp; craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer.</p>\n<p>Make business alliances. These dead bodies don&#39;t need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it&#39;s being efficient with recycling!</p>\n<p>Explore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T21:46:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/066/066eb1b7a3f332b8089645fbf8c3ebdc.jpg", "website": "http://graveyardkeeper.com", "rating": 3.73, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 150, "owned": 2264, "beaten": 131, "toplay": 105, "dropped": 212, "playing": 62}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 449, "ratings_count": 403, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 408, "platforms": ["Android", "PlayStation 4", "Linux", "macOS", "PC", "iOS", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["tinyBuild", "Lazy Bear Games", "Magic Cat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild", "Magic Cat"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
