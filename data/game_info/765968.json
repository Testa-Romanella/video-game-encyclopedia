However, what at first seems as an idyllic and magical world soon starts to show signs of a dark and twisted past filled with dread, corruption and chaos. A past that everyone in SEEK wants to mantain hidden, but that threatens to come back for revenge.\r\n</p>\n<p>This demo covers the first half of the final game.
