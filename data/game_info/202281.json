It took us about two weeks if I remember correctly, and we were challenged to make a museum displaying different things, but we were challenged by not being able to make any of the assets ourselves. This was a fun activity and I chose to make a museum detailing how to make a strawberry tart from a recipe by Martha Stewart. I liked the idea of a huge building showing simple steps (a recipe) and being totally useless since it'd be hard to follow the steps in this space to make the recipe itself. However, it totally works! The non-game photos are of the tart I made following the recipe. It was extremely tasty, I'd recommend it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy and happy cooking! :)</p>\n<p>Everything under the following list is not mine, was created by the parties linked. None of the assets in the files from those links are mine, and I don\u2019t claim them to be mine, I merely used them in the project as per the requirements of the assessment task.<br/>Asset list:<br/>Skybox:<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/free-skybox-cubemap-extended-1...<br/>FREE Skybox - Cubemap Extended by BOXOPHOBIC<br/>Low Poly vegetation:<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/lowpoly-vegetation-season-pa...<br/>LowPoly Vegetation Season Pack Lite by CRAZY SHADOW<br/>Fruit:<br/>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/80254<br/>Fruit Pack by ASTRO3D<br/>Dishes:<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/dish-tray-5333<br/>Dish&amp;Tray by YUJI NAGATA<br/>Furniture:<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/simple-home-stuff-69129<br/>Simple Home Stuff by MOHELM97<br/>Recipe:<br/>https://www.marthastewart.com/340929/strawberry-tart<br/>Wood texture:<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/wood/wood-texture-fl...<br/>Wood Texture Floor by ANTONIO NEVES<br/>Bowl:<br/>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/80208<br/>Kitchen Props Free by JAKE SULLIVAN<br/>Spoon:<br/>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/106932<br/>Cutlery Silverware PBR by DEVOTID</p>\n<p>Controller:</p>\n<p>http://torahhorse.com/first-person-drifter-controller-for-unity3d<br/>First Person Controller</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d497c09e0b8d90b1276bef993d2139e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
