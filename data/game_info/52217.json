That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.<br />\nThe battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking the place of towers.  Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy.  The overall game structure is similar to &#39;tactical&#39; RPG&#39;s, but with a real-time battle system.  Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.<br />\nIt also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced, snappy, and always relevant to gameplay with minimal exposition. Finally, it&#39;s got options and accessibility settings out the wazoo, so that you can have the best possible experience!<br />\nRemote Play requires PS Vita system and sufficiently robust Wi-Fi connection.<br />\n1 player<br />\n350MB minimum save size<br />\nDUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br />\nRemote Play<br />\nSoftware subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
