Help rescue him by punching the living daylight out of these nasty bees and their vile king. Not many people know this, but licking absolutely everything around you can offer a considerable amount of protein, which keeps your stamina levels up, so go ahead and use your tongue as much as possible (in the game of course!!!).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Buttons:\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Support -\u00a0Keyboard/Xbox Controller\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Movement - WASD/D-Pad\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jump - Space/A\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dash - Shift/B\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tongue - L/Y</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Punch\u00a0- K/X</p>\n<p>Font Used:   </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0m5x7 by Daniel Linssen</p>\n<p>Sound samples:</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0soundbible.com</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0freesound.org</p><p>Development Details:</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This is a game I originally wanted to finish in 2 weeks, but it ended up taking 3 in total. My main goal was to make an NES inspirited cartoony game, where the main mechanic was a hook. I decided a toad\u2019s tongue would be a perfect match, but I eventually decided to also incorporate a basic 3-combo fighting system. Punching uses stamina while in the air, while hooking yourself onto something with the tongue recovers stamina, which means that the player needs to constantly use the tongue to stay airborne. The graphics were inspirited by the NES game \u201cChip \u2019n Dale\u201d, \u201cHollow Knight\u201d and \u201cSunnyland Woods\u201d by Ansimuz (look for him on Itch, he's awesome).</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:10:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bf/2bfc3f191fa178c453c3ab262824b2c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OcO"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
