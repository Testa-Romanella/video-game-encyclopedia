Maybe I will try to be better for the next TriJam. My goal was to force the player to go to the yellow area in order to take more risk.\r\n</p>\n<p>I am also aware there is a glitch when the boss move, the yellow bar still increase no matter where you are. Please try to stay in the yellow area to complete the challenge.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:06:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/474/4740a87a2ae803c21ec997b35394e0ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Comte_67"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
