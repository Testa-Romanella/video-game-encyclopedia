In this game, you can switch between day and night on the fly while racing. The daytime is normal, however, night is different. At night time, your car will receive a significant speed boost, aiding in faster lap times. However, getting involved in even the most minute of collisions will result in you losing the race. Compete in the global leaderboards for the spot of the #1 lunadriver.\u00a0\u00a0(More info in the help page)</p>\n<p>Currently, there are only 3 maps and 3 cars in the game. I'll add more content soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T13:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98a/98a5420361d3f256950ae09e3d146240.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arj783"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
