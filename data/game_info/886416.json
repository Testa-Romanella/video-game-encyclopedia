Carefully use the town\u2019s retainers to complete the Shogun\u2019s tasks and win favour. The most prosperous Daimyo will be granted the title to the town.</p>\n<p><em>Micro Dojo</em>\u00a0is a 20 min tactical euro game for two players, intended to fit comfortably in a pocket or purse. In\u00a0<em>Micro Dojo</em>, players take control of the Ninja, Samurai, Sumo and Geisha meeples to generate resources, develop the town, and score points by achieving the Shogun\u2019s tasks.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Each turn players move one of the four meeples to an adjacent space and take the action there - either gathering resources, taking a building, or activating a scoring objective. The catch? You can't move the last meeple either you or your opponent moved. The games end when the last objective is triggered, or a player reaches 7 points.\r\n</p>\n<p>Movement is tight, requiring you to second guess your opponents plan. Timing is crucial, triggering objective scoring only when it benefits you. Like a sparring match, every move should be chosen with precision and efficiency, or your opponent will strike.\r\n</p>\n\n\r\nLoyalty &amp; Deceit Expansion\r\n\n<p>Your hard work in\u00a0<em>Micro Dojo</em>\u00a0drew the eye of the Shogun, but also gained the attention of two rival clans that now try to claim the town for their own.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Shinchoku clan bring progress and prosperity, whilst the Tsuyo clan cultivate power and corruption.\r\n</p>\n<p>Pledge your loyalty, earn support, and help your chosen clan come to power.\r\n</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T04:39:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0e/a0e33ae947dcc479db7dfb754d07e863.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Prometheus Game Labs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
