The gameplay involves pressing one of the three numbered keys (1, 2 or 3) corresponding to the rock, paper and scissors moves of the game, trying to beat the opponent&#39;s choice. All this is done while seeing a drawing of a young girl. The girl removes an item of her clothing after each successful round, and the player wins the game when she is completely naked. The player character has five symbolic clothes items, i.e. losing five rounds leads to a Game Over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/150/150fd1f3f7ea5a978f375f522dacdee9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
