Engaging! <br/><br/>A wholesome mix of idle \u201cCatch Some Zs\u201d gameplay and \u201cCatch Them All\u201d combat, \u201cS.We.T.Y?\u201d features a huge cast of loveable and loathsome characters, faster-than-light space travel set to a slower-than-slight soundtrack, and tons of intriguing destinations to discover and then immediately leave behind.<br/><br/>Fun to play for five minutes or five hours, it\u2019s the perfect game to play in between other more demanding games!<h3>Featuring:</h3><ul><li>A cast of 65 characters to collect, each with their own special abilities and winning personalities. Just so many personalities. <br/></li><li>A relaxing (and oddly addicting) idle space travel experience. Crank the cosmic-y tunes and tap your ship to get up to max speed. Or just use the auto-tappers. That\u2019s what they\u2019re for.<br/></li><li>Hundreds of stories and Missions for your crew, as they encounter black holes, super novae, hostile aliens, evil twins, space cows, hair stylists, cosmic horrors, and Larry. <br/></li><li>A unique Merge PVP battle mode, with highly advanced turn-based combat. Merge ships together to form your fleet, deploy them to attack your enemies, or activate your Crew\u2019s special abilities!<br/></li><li>Basically unlimited planets and star systems to explore. Well not really - but there\u2019s a lot. Space is big! It\u2019s right there in the name. <br/></li><li>A super chill soundtrack that will make the lightyears roll by in a contented vibe.  <br/></li><li>Optional in-game purchases can boost your progress (and feed our artists), but the game is completely do-able Free To Play. Just like a real post-scarcity futuristic society!</li></ul><br/>\u201cStar We There Yet?\u201d is a fresh and flavorful blend of different game styles, with a little something for everyone. When fully operational, it will allow players to battle across platforms and continents and probably solar systems eventually.<br/><br/>What are you waiting for? Play Space Game: Star We There Yet? and set a course for adventure! (And cosmic horror.
