Every successful hit advances your current time, and you can score combos with projectile minute hands!</p>\n<p>A bonus Hourglass spawns every 12 hours to restore health. Enemy speed and frequency increases every 24 hours. Brush up on your \"circle time\" and survive as long as possible!</p>\n<p>Audio provided by: https://opengameart.org/</p>\n<p>All coding and art completed independently.
