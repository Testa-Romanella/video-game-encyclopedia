This idea came from me and my 10 years old daughter when we were listening to the \"little spider climb up the wall\" song. Always Zap is a platform game where you play as Zap, a cute little spider and has to climb up platforms as high as you can. The game is under development and this is the prototype version of the modes tutorial and Always up. Our team decided to share this prototype with you so you can test the game mechanics. A lot is coming and an alpha version with 90's cartoon-style graphics is coming. The Story mode is under development. What we have here is just the prototype and bugs are expected. Also, the level design isn't perfect so, if you have any frustration with it, please I want to say sorry in advance. Enjoy and please, leave feedback. This will be very important to help us to improve the final version. Do you want to help our project to grow, please, make a donation. Zap and the Wise Foxes Interactive team thank you for playing. :)\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T09:07:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed5/ed51c1871b08b1f8ce0a21c8e83cc96e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wise Foxes Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
