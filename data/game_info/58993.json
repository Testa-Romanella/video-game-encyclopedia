Play as Teku, a young novice on a dangerous journey to rescue his tribe's shaman from the evil tribe of the Wakcha. But the way is littered with sinister traps and difficult obstacles. To master these challenges, you need to have keen eyes and a good sense for your environment, or your next step may be your last.\r\n\r\nBut Teku has a special gift: his left hand is a candle. Let it be a bright beacon to drive off your enemies or to shed light on dark places.\r\nGorgeous hand-painted watercolor visuals give Candle that special flair, as all backgrounds and characters have been carefully drawn and then scanned, picture after picture. The game consistently feels like a living painting.", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2016-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-10T19:29:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf4/cf49a7aa8498c3ead491af41f3da95cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 38, "owned": 460, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 70, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 511, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 30, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Merge Games", "Teku Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Daedalic Entertainment", "Merge Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
