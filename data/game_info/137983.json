Taking in account that \"illusion\" and \"hiding\" are synonyms of \"lie\", we decided to associate the theme to this unusual mechanic. The goal is to travel through the levels and reach the portal to advance to the next one. Whenever the player collides with traps, lighten or not, it will have to restart the level.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>A and D - Movement<br/>Space - Jump<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/413/413f0d0c6765e799162c585300875633.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IPCAGameJam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
