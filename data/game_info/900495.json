Collect relics to gain new movement and combat* abilities, and venture further through the open world.<br/></p>\n<p>*Note: Version 0.1.0 is extremely buggy and incomplete. This release was made in just 4 weeks as a self-imposed challenge. Your feedback on what currently exists, and what will be in the future will be greatly appreciated. \u00a0A list of known issues below:</p>\n<ul><li>Godot 4 is still in beta, so crashes may happen randomly.</li><li>Enemies don't exist because I spent too much time making their mechanics \"work\" that I didn't think about the performance impact of having 50+ enemies processing all at once.</li><li>The mystery of the island cannot be solved.</li><li>Ledge grabbing near slopes can be problematic.</li><li>Controls cannot be rebound</li><li>Video settings cannot be changed</li><li>Player can get stuck with no other option than to reset</li><li>Almost no sounds</li><li>Some other stuff I can't think of because it's 2AM and I'm burnt-out/sleep-deprived.</li></ul>\n<p>The game will continue to be updated until it's \"complete\". Updates may be slow to roll out. Mac builds will be made available in future updates.<br/>This game is currently free, but I may put a price tag on it once I get it to a point where it's substantial. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T07:15:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85d19e80f759b845bc0f93bd4dc1f280.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["ZetCipher"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
