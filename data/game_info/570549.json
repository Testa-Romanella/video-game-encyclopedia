Full credits in the game.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is about destroying enemies that come in waves by introducing a pattern in a physical spellbook shaped controller with sensors that depending on the pattern introduced by weilding a magnetic wand\u00a0would cast a spell that deals with a particular type of enemy.<br/></p>\n<p>This project was part of the Image Campus' Summer Jam on early 2020. The idea was to create something that could be played using something other than regular controllers, as in keyboards, mouse, or joysticks of any kind. It would've been presented on a display together with many other project by fellow students without regular inputs so it lacks configuration options as it was supposed to be presented arcade-like with just a way to play it and nothing else. Be wary if you're wearing headphones as the music might be too loud as it is in the final prototype that was released.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the whole thing took place right before the covid-19 outbreak and the whole thing got cancelled, never able to make the formal presentation of the project leaving it canned as it was. While there's not direct way of playing the game as intended, the inputs are mapped in a way that can be read by the numpad in a similar fashion to what was intended to be on the physical spellbook. Since the rules were supposed to be printed on the book for ease of access and immersion, and due to the unavailability of those,</p>\n<p>Next I'll proceed to list some of the basic elements on how to play the game:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0The whole game as it is may only be played with the numpad.</li><li>You introduce codes on the numpad as a sequence of 4 different numbers so it forms a 4 digit number, when the 4 numbers are registered if the combination results in an existing spell then it's succesfully cast, if not, the code resets and you can try again.</li><li>If at any point you screw up in the middle of\u00a0the code you can press the 0 on the numpad to immediately reset the sequence and try again from the beggining.</li></ul>\n<p>=============== P\u00a0L A Y I N G - T H E - G A M E\u00a0===============</p>\n<ul><li>On the main menu you have to input a 7 digit code to start the game: <strong>1598753</strong></li><li>You can also access the credits by introducing a different 7 digit code: <strong>4565456</strong>, repeating the code should bring you back to the main screen.</li><li>Once the game starts enemies will start to spawn walking towards you, if they reach you, you take a hit. If you take 4 hits you're sent back to the main menu.</li><li>Enemies start spawning slowly but will spawn faster as the time goes by. There cannot be more than 10 enemies on screen at the same time, but they'll eventually overwhelm you due to their extremely high spawn rate.</li><li>Each enemy is of one of four types:\u00a0Water, Fire, Ice, Plant, and you need to cast it's corresponding spell element in order to defeat them.</li><li>The codes for each spell are:</li></ul>\r\nFire: <strong>7589</strong>Water: <strong>4863</strong>Ice: <strong>4596</strong>Plant: <strong>8651</strong>\n<p>Finally, I want to acknowledge that the game lacks polish, it was the very last version we had achieved with the team before the whole thing got canned and would've needed some finishing touches to make the experience as we intended, while also it being a pitty that it could never reach it's intended final presentation due to the quarentine.</p>\n<p>I hope in behalf of all the people involved in the development of this small project that you have some moments of enjoyment and imagine how it would've been to play it properly with the actual custom controller that was intended to be played with.</p>\n<p>================ S C R E E N S H O T S\u00a0================</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:50:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f7/4f794efbf1101231d49cf07e549d06d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William Montblanc"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
