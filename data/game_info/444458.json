{"id": 444458, "slug": "magic-trick", "name": "Magic Trick (itch)", "name_original": "Magic Trick (itch)", "description": "Magic Trick is a magical skateboarding adventure game, featuring expressive skating movement and trick combos, a totally explorable whimsical sunset world, and adorable townsfolk offering quests and companionship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Magic Trick seeks to fulfill everyone\u2019s greatest desire: being a skateboarding magician. The player embodies Sunset Isles\u2019 newest resident: WizKid (pronouns: they/them), who can perform radical magic by using skate trick combos! The day is nearly over, but Wizkid wants to explore the town and meet their new neighbors before calling it a day. The twilight adventure begins at the skate park to hone their skills with skateboarding legend, Tony the Hawk. Tony teaches the player skating tricks ranging from a simple ollie to a gnarly backflip, while Wizkid\u2019s magic allows the player to perform incredible feats such as skating at super speed, spawning a ramp from thin air, and flying to the top of the sky. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The world is the player\u2019s skatepark, with ramps and grind rails ready to be shredded! Help a curious cat get out of a tree, race a running rabbit down main street, or even explore your artistic side with some painterly pups by finding their collectible cards. Once Wizkid is ready to call it a day, the player can skate back home to the suburbs and celebrate with all their new friends.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T02:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/436/4367af46343846298d3bbe3136c0a5ff.jpg", "website": "http://magictrickgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Georgio Klironomos", "MagicTrick", "L8r Sk8rs Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["L8r Sk8rs Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
