You must stop Dr. Science by fighting his supernatural lab rats before your friends are destroyed!<br/></p>\n<p>Supernatural-themed jam game made in three days.</p>\n<p>The web version has numerous issues; the executable version is recommended.<br/></p>\n<p>Created with GameMaker Studio 1.4. Source code on Github.</p>\r\n\r\n3D\r\n<p>All the 3D in this game is \"fake\". Everything that seems 3D uses the\u00a0draw_sprite_pos\u00a0function. Fake 3D functions can be found in the\u00a0F3D\u00a0script group. (The math behind the fake 3D is rather simple; I was surprised how well it worked!)\r\n</p>\r\nPerformance\r\n<p>The pathfinding was easy to implement, but it's not very performant. AStar pathfinding would be a lot better. Performance is worse on the web version.</p>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Creator: MikeeyBikeey\r\n</p>\n<p>Music: AnAaronBaron\r\n</p>\n<p>Main Menu Background Art: Caroline Zina\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Feedback is welcomed!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T06:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffa/ffadcb2d0ce8aed7f10379b22872968b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MikeeyBikeey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
