It's my first time creating any sort of story for a game and is only my second ever game jam so I learned a lot throughout the process. Hopefully the game is enjoyable :)</p>\n<p>Control your character with 'A' and 'D', jump with 'Space' and interact with any objects that have an exclamation mark by using 'E'. Hopefully the rest manages to explain itself within the game.</p>\n<p>I worked as a solo developer on this project, however I did make use of free assets for both art and music.<br/></p>\n<p>All feedback is very much welcomed as I want to continue to improve!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by and for checking out my game\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/883/8833619c25f327a658781ceb4131f2e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Loftus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
