It was a very simple game written in python using pygame and you had only one thing to do:\u00a0<em>Varo puskia.\u00a0</em>This is Finnish and means:\u00a0<em>Watch out for the bushes.\u00a0</em>This is also my first game i made using Godot Engine. Use Space to jump and Escape for pause menu on desktop, on mobile you have the appropriate ui elements for that. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T03:13:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d0/3d091ccb4359ab285ef6e7be8b39dcb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kirottu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
