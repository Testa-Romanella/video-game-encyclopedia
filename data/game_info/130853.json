It's inspired by Super Crate Box, but it has a twist to it: you can upgrade your gun. You have to collect stars to upgrade it. When an enemy hit you, you lose 5 stars and when an enemy fall in the hole, you lose 10 stars. You die when you have less than 0 stars.</p><p><strong>Twitter:  https://twitter.com/_smallphil</strong> (come say hi !)</p><p>The sounds were made with http://www.bfxr.net/, except for the jetpack one (I did it with my mouth :D).</p><p>Music loop: http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-sam...</p><p>You can play with an Xbox 360 controller !</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p><strong>Move</strong></p><p>A and D</p><p>Arrow keys</p><p>LS (Xbox 360 controller)</p><p><strong>Jump</strong></p><p>Space</p><p>W</p><p>Up arrow key</p><p>Z</p><p>A button (Xbox 360 controller)</p><p><strong>Shoot</strong></p><p>Return</p><p>X</p><p>X button (Xbox 360 controller)</p><p>RB (Xbox 360 controller)</p><p><strong>Dash</strong></p><p>Q and D</p><p>LT and RT (Xbox controller)</p><p><strong>Pause/Quit</strong></p><p>Escape</p><p>Start (Xbox 360 controller)</p><p><strong>Upgrade</strong></p><p>Tab</p><p>Select (Xbox 360 controller)</p><p>SmallPhil</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a1765df295656b4389ff7c0b7bf923ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SmallPhil"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
