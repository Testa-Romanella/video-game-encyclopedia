Zero margin of error.<br/><br/>Goats on a Bridge adapts the classic Norwegian fairy tale, Three Billy Goats Gruff, as an inventive new platformer that has players controlling not one, but two goats at the same time. That\u2019s twice the capra-control of Goat Simulator! Sadly, this has the makings of a tragic tale.<br/><br/>Tempo and Chubbs\u2019 poor brother has been abducted by an evil troll, and it\u2019s down to you to direct the pair as they jump, dodge and roll their way across a series of hazardous bridges to track down their lost sibling. There\u2019ll be bizarre collectibles, accessory-selling amphibians and even an energetic corgi to help you on your adventures. Just be sure not to let your four-legged friends plummet into the water. That\u2019d really get their goat.Features<ul><li>2 Different Game Modes<br/></li><li>Single-player, co-operative and competitive herding<br/></li><li>10 time-based levels challenge players to secure all 3 stars<br/></li><li>Visit the Stash to admire your recently discovered Rainbow Toast<br/></li><li>A sophisticated frog sells bold accessories to customize your characters at the Stump<br/></li><li>Dash Mode turns the game into a procedurally generated endless runner<br/></li><li>Supports PS3\u2122, PS4\u2122, Xbox 360\u2122 &amp; Xbox One\u2122 Controllers<br/></li><li>Doesn\u2019t require much RAM\u2026 (yeah, we went there)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:52:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cf/0cf5226e99c4ab9134ba80ff9986439f.jpg", "website": "http://www.goatsonabridge.com/", "rating": 1.75, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 217, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cabygon"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Degica"], "esrb_rating": null}
