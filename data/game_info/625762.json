It is inspired by the classic Prop Hunt mod where players must disguise themselves as an object in the scenery to avoid detection by a hunter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Run Prop, Run! can have up to 12 players and begins with one <strong>Hunter</strong> trying to catch other hiding <strong>Prop</strong> players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As each <strong>Prop</strong> gets caught, they will turn into Hunters making it more and more difficult for the remaining <strong>Props</strong> to survive the hunt.<br/>To help the <strong>Props</strong> survive, they are given the ability to transform into any object in the stage so they can better blend into the environment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When a Hunter captures a prop, it turns it into a Hunter. Start 1 Hunter VS 11 Props, and finish with up to 11 Hunters VS 1 prop!<br/>It's not just Prop Hunt Hide and Seek. There's a lot of mechanics revolving around platforming, abilities, and strategy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T03:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bed/bed07fea5316c97f3428fca419411115.jpg", "website": "https://www.playtogether-studio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PlayTogether Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TILT"], "esrb_rating": null}
