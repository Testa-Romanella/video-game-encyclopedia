The concept is simple, select a group of circles, and flip their order. But the more you progress the more you need to step back, and think about each and every flip. Atmospheric and calming, Orbit allows you to relax, and enjoy the puzzles in your own time.</p>\n\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 47 - Stuck in a Loop</p>\n<p>Depending on feedback I might flesh it out more and add more features, let me know what features you think would be good in the future<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af1141e1c85494f8866dbc6c83fe29b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JudeHDesign"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
