{"id": 524787, "slug": "space-drill", "name": "Space Drill", "name_original": "Space Drill", "description": "<p>Space Drill is an arcade infinite-runner, in which you drill through a space station in order to destroy it. You can hold left or right to position yourself in the left or right lane and release all keys to return to the center. You'll encounter different obstacles and powerups along the way and have to keep an eye on the heat level of your drill. If it reaches too high, you'll explode in a ball of fire!<br/>With each level the difficulty rises and new enemies and powerups are introduced. To destroy the station you'll have to reach a score of 5000, but it's not the end - how far can you go?</p>\n<p>Space Drill was the first game I've ever made and it will always have a special place in my heart. I created it in 2015 for mobiles and it was the start of my gamedev journey. After 5 years I decided to port it to PC so that it will be preserved and more people can play it. If you'd like to know more look out for a dev log I will be posting soon. But for now, please enjoy Space Drill!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Code and design by Doku<br/>Graphics by Maciej \u0141azowski<br/>Music by Patryk 'SiergiejW' Jusi\u0144ski<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:15:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/955/95552cc58cd9cc4642e55c7e5504aa0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Doku"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
