Tap the screen, press the space bar or click to make the pug thrust upwards. The pug falls with gravity. The aim of the game is to avoid the obstacles, every time you avoid an obstacle you score a point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the end of the game your score is calculated and the high score is stored on the device. I might at some time figure out a way to have an online score board but that does not exist yet.</p>\n<p>Jetpack Pug is available for Windows and Linux and android.<br/></p>\n<p> I'll work on a Mac OS version soon too. I also have a html play in browser build that I might add to my website<br/></p>\n<p>If you play the game make sure to leave me a comment to let me know what you thought of it and any feedback that might help me developing the other games that I am working on.\u00a0And\u00a0make\u00a0sure\u00a0you\u00a0include\u00a0your\u00a0high\u00a0score!!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa3/fa3862f654957e557a15671525dec219.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Games I Made For Freya"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
