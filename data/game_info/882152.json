Update v2.3: a few tweaks :) UPDATE (v2.2): * Improved 3D * A LOT less laggy. Runs really fast online now :D (Thanks to amcerbu for the sizing tip \u2014 go check out his 3D/physics projects!) === There are 100+ remixes in total (across all versions), so I collected some of the most interesting ones into a little gallery http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/140586 \u2014 as per eventexception's suggestion. My favourite remix is metalheadprod's 3D Moto Game http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/metalheadprod/529568 \u2014 managed to completely change the game! Remix it, change something interesting, and let me know! :D Maybe add a level? Be creative! === UPDATE: added control selection screen to choose between keyboard or mouse (: New features in v2 (as suggested from the comments on v1): * New level! * Plane's shadow added, so you can see where your plane is in relation to the next hole. * Mouse Control (It had music, but it took up 3MB and wasn't even very good, so I removed it :P) I was trying to make an interesting 3D game in Scratch, and this is what I came up with! It runs a little slowly in Scratch, should be okay in presentation mode, and fine on the website. (Particularly with the Flash player.) === HOW IT WORKS: In summary: \"set size to (100 / z)\" Where \"z\" is the distance from the screen. (Again, thanks to amcerbu for the dividing by Z thing... (: )</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T15:44:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ef/8efa0fa3a224b3cbb62e3270d91f649c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lemaitreduNether"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
