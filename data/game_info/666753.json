I developed it mainly to gain some experience with the engine, but I think it has become something special.<br/>In the game, you play the role of a simple farmer in a post-apocalyptic world with no food or resources. You have a house near the road where you can trade with merchants who stop by to do business and gather some resources. Your main goal in this game is to plant, water, harvest and sell vegetables and that's it :)<br/>You can find here few types of seeds which\u00a0grows different plants, several\u00a0tools that helps you with farming and your beautiful\u00a0house where you can rest after hard work.<br/></p>\n<p>I dont't have much more to say about that game :)<br/>As I mentioned, it was mainly for leraning purpose and I'm really happy I made this game because even if it looks simple it was tricky to get all the mechanics to work as indended :D<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this and maybe playing this game.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T04:00:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d89f63f4b027700401138166e2af3c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silent Satelite"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
