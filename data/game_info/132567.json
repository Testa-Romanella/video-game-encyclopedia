There are placeholder assets everywhere, including annoying procedurally pre-generated music. The difficulty of levels is unbalanced sometimes ridiculously high. However, I think some people might still find it an interesting experience.</p>\n<p>If anybody is interested, the source code is available on github.</p>\n<p>Also, this game was made with L\u00d6VE \u2665.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul>\n<li>Only 40 levels.</li>\n<li>Placeholder assets everywhere.</li>\n<li>Annoying procedurally pre-generated music (can be turned off).</li>\n<li>Cheat codes (for free, not behind microtransactions).</li>\n<li>Gamepad support (Xbox One controller and some others).</li>\n<li>Level editor.</li>\n</ul>\r\nCheat codes\r\n<ul>\n<li>Type unlockalllevels in level selection screen to unlock all levels.</li>\n<li>Type winthislevel to complete current level.</li>\n</ul>\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard\r\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cursor keys</em> - Movement</li>\n<li><em>Enter/Space bar</em> - Action</li>\n<li><em>Escape</em> - Back</li>\n<li><em>R</em> - Restart level</li>\n<li><em>S</em> - Quick save</li>\n<li><em>L</em> - Quick load</li>\n</ul>\r\nGamepad\r\n<ul>\n<li><em>D-pad</em> - Movement</li>\n<li><em>A</em> - Action</li>\n<li><em>B</em> - Back</li>\n<li><em>X</em> - Quick save</li>\n<li><em>Y</em> - Quick load</li>\n</ul>\r\nFAQ\r\nHow do I start the game? There is no executable file.\r\n<p>If you have downloaded the universal release (the one that does not include executable), you will have to install L\u00d6VE framework (0.11) to run the game.
