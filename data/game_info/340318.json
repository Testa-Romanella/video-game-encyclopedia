Its a text based adventure made in Twine 2,\u00a0in which\u00a0you become Verne in order to be horny and also commit crimes (things you cannot do unless you're Verne).</p>\n<p>Its very cursed and I spent way too long making it (most of it written in a caffeine driven delirium). There's\u00a011 endings total, so now you may suffer as I have suffered, enjoy!</p>\n<p>Content warnings for: mild violence, murder, (and cringe).</p>\n<p>Note: the music doesn't work for some people who play in chrome for some reason? I have no clue why that happens, but I think it has to do with individual chrome settings rather than the game itself.</p>\n<p>If anything else besides the music isn't working then please let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T03:41:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f3/7f3b3452636653ccf306186a28c9b681.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["foolio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
