Your objective is to protect the sacrifice-pit from pixel-warriors and sacrifice jellies to the pit for high-score.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>You can\u00a0<strong>box select</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>single select</strong>\u00a0with\u00a0left mouse\u00a0button, and issue a\u00a0<strong>move order</strong>\u00a0with\u00a0right mouse\u00a0button. While jellies are selected you can press\u00a0S\u00a0or\u00a0SPACE\u00a0to\u00a0<strong>split your jellies</strong>, you can only split them if your jellies are big enough.</p>\r\nMore info\r\n<p>Move your jellies in good position for them to shoot approaching enemies. If you move the jellies over the sacrifice pit they will be sacrificed and heal the pit and add points to high-score, depending on jelly size. If the enemy moves over the pit, the pit will lose health and eventually you will lose.</p>\n<p>You lose if you run out of jellies or the pit dies.</p>\r\nDev Info\r\n<p>I believe this was my 4th LD-Solo Event, this time i was very rusty since i hadn\u2019t touched Unity or Coding in half a year. So most of the things took longer than expected. I am kind a happy about art this time, mostly. Sadly i didn\u2019t had enough time to implement the most fun part of the game - mutations.\u00a0</p>\r\nTools I used to make this game\r\n<ul><li>Unity with VisualStudio</li><li>Art : Paint.net, Inkscape, Paint</li><li>Sound : Bfxr, Boscaceoil</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Have fun and thanks for playing!\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73d/73d57b2951aff46b4b963604920d1c3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["negativice"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
