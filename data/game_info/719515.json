I hope you find it somewhat charming and enjoy your 5 minutes playing it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made this game after my wife and I drove to a certain dollar store for some last-minute Christmas knick-knacks, and then realized based on the long line going out of the store that we were kidding ourselves thinking it would be safe and responsible to go inside during this ongoing pandemic. Consider this a peek into a less chaotic version of the past two holiday seasons.</p>\n<p>If you want a challenge, consider drawing some fanart of your haul.<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This game is a ZZT world. Press P at the title screen to play, use the arrow keys to move around and touch objects, and press S to create a save file. You can reload a save by pressing R on the title screen.</p>\n<p>For more information about ZZT (and access to thousands of other worlds), please visit the Museum of ZZT.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T09:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b8/3b891145f8e4778fe5540603711370bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RT-55J"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
