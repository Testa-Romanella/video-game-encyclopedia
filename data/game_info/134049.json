{"id": 134049, "slug": "stratum", "name": "Stratum", "name_original": "Stratum", "description": "<p>This project was made by me for Pastel Jam 2018. Though the game was originally intended to be a 3D platformer, the necessary coding turned out to be too much for me to do all in one weekend (on top of the art, animation, character models, etc.). However, I felt like Stratum was too beautiful not to show the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this simple game, you take on the role of Zillian, an alien who's been stranded on a meteorite. She needs to collect 3 crystals to repair her ship so she can go home. Though you can collect the crystals, there is technically no end-screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will probably do more work with this project -- I love Zillian too much to abandon her. I am uploading this current version for the sake of getting my project in on time for the Pastel Jam.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The download file is called Lustrum, but it is all the same game. When I started my Pastel Jam project, I wasn't sure what I wanted the final game to be called. Hence why some Stratum files are titled \"Lustrum\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fb/0fbcaa72705da47fce1fe18183085983.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shazzy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
