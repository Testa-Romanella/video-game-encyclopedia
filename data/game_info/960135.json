Or sometimes a mink. Or sometimes... well, there's a lot of different things she and her friends turn into.<br/><br/>Margaret de Campos is a young clerk at a local bookstore who needs some change in her life. Her job feels like a dead end, her love life is in a rut, and she's not happy with how she looks. All of that is upended when she stumbles upon a box of magical tea with the tendency to transform people into anthropomorphic animals. Depending on your choices, the lives of Margaret, her friends, and her coworkers are irrevocably changed as the story leads to several wildly different paths.
