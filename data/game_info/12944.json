Find the best areas to score points, discover secret areas and search for the shady dealer. <br/>Random events offer fun challenges to any player that wishes to participate.

This guarantees populated matches and saving you the hassle of finding an active match. All game \u201crooms\u201d reserve extra friend slots (10 players per game) so that your friends can ALWAYS join you through the Steam friend join feature.<br/><br/>Whenever an online connection is not available, the game smoothly transitions into a fully playable singleplayer version. Connectivity is never a problem!<br/><br/><br/>Ready for a car RPG leveling system that we\u2019ve gone crazy?!<br/>Every car has four statistics: top speed, nitro, acceleration and grip. By using nitro, you increase this car\u2019s nitro capacity, by driving at top speed you increase your top speed...you get the drift? When a car has all of it\u2019s four statistics raised to 10/10, you will gain an overall level which allows you to buy a new car and earns you prestige on the in-game scoreboard and the Steam leaderboard.<br/><br/><br/>Since the tank is such a popular vehicle in the main game modes, we decided to dedicate one entire game mode to it. In CD2: Tank Battles you choose one of five unique tanks and strive to dominate the arena. Shoot or bump opponents off this sky arena to score points, extra points are awarded for special achievements such as multi kills, revenge, air shots and so on.<br/>When playing this game mode offline, bots(A.I.) will fill the opponent slots. This way the singleplayer is also fully playable.<br/><br/><br/>Crash Drive 2 originally started as a tablet game. The following features set the Steam version apart from the original:<br/><ul><li> The steam version does not have advertisements nor \"in-app\" purchases<br/></li><li> A big starting cash boost of 200,000 extra cash (would\u2019ve cost over $5 in the original tablet game)<br/></li><li> Optimized for PC, Mac and Linux; better graphics, performance and controller support<br/></li><li> Further fixes and small tweaks to the game<br/></li><li> Steam integration (including friend joining, achievements and leaderboard)<br/></li><li> Includes a free giftable copy of the game to share with a friend<br/></li><li> Cross Platform multiplayer between PC,WEB and Mobile/Tablet</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:04:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caa/caa4b8de38ce90eda43edac6df5bce6a.jpg", "website": "http://www.m2h.nl/crashdrive-2/", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 311, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["M2H", "SPIL GAMES"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["M2H", "SPIL Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
