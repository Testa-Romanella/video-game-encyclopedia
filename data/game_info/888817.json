Someone needs to put a stop to this!</p>\n<p>This is a bullet hell game. Mow down waves and waves of gross creepy crawlies that want to ruin your day! Fight your way through twelve levels, upgrade your skills, and show those bugs who's in charge!</p>\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<p>The game should run on just about anything, but just to be safe:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Windows</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>CPU: anything that's not ancient\r\n</li><li>Graphics: Integrated graphics should be fine\r\n</li><li>RAM: 100 MB\r\n</li><li>Storage: 50 MB\r\n</li><li>Requires a 64-bit operating system</li></ul>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>I posted this game's development on YouTube, covering about a half hour of work every week for a year and a half. Check it out!\r\n</p>\n<p>The source code can be found in\u00a0this Github repository. If you run the game through GameMaker, you can access the level editor and some other tools that I\u00a0used to help make it!</p>\r\nReporting Problems\r\n<p>If find any bugs in the game (lol), please use the\u00a0Github issue tracker. The game runs pretty well, although there's an issue where the game sometimes fails to start Level 12 that I\u00a0haven't been able to find the cause of yet.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Background objects: kenney.nl</li><li>Bug objects:\u00a0@alemunin</li><li>Sound effects:\u00a0kenney.nl,\u00a0Soniss</li><li>Music:\u00a0RyanAvx</li><li>Icon:\u00a0Dragonfly by Gr\u00e9gory Montigny from NounProject.com</li><li>Everyone who followed along and commented on the YouTube series</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T14:02:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/036/036b06320cebfc7493f1f7dd8dc2dcf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dragonite"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
