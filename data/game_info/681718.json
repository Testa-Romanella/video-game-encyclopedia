{"id": 681718, "slug": "space-pirate-prototype-smejks", "name": "Space Pirate Prototype (Smejks)", "name_original": "Space Pirate Prototype (Smejks)", "description": "<p>Sound design is inspired by the pseudo-realistic take on sounds in space as heard in\u00a0House of the Dying Sun, Battlestar Galactica or Firefly for example.</p>\n<p>The goal is to destroy the escorts, the red ship firing missiles and the green ship firing heavy cannon. The transport will continuously call for Law Enforcement ships to warp in in greater and greater numbers.</p>\n<p>I tried to \"show, don't tell\" as much as possible, but still there is a lot of text and STILL some things are unclear to the player, so that's a very important lesson learned.</p>\n<p>Some things that are less obvious: The green ship will drop pickups when shot, while the red ship only drops pickups via the endless missiles it fires. The transport has a much higher drop rate but with the caveat that you must not let it reach 0 hp or you lose.</p>\n<p>You can aim more precisely if you hold down space or left bumper, useful for taking out Police ships if you are on their tail.</p>\n<p>Holding space while in jamming range of the Warp Point will slowly refill HP and Ammo but will greatly shorten the time before the next wave of police ships.</p>\n<p>Once the escorts are taken out, you need to lower the transports HP to less than 5 but more than 0 to disable it. This will cause its distress call to cease and will render it immobile, allowing you to tow it to the warp point by holding Space (or X on dual shock)\u00a0for tractor beam.</p>\n<p>Have fun, and if you have feedback, ideas for changes or video of you playing it\u00a0PLEASE share it with me! It's invaluable for learning what to do differently and what to keep going forward.</p>\n<p>Supports controller, but I need to use DS4Windows to get it working with Dual Shock 4.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:20:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/751/75133910e342b13ae0535d7c521587dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smejks"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
