Seek for yourself the beauties of Naples, experience the last hours of life in Pompeii before Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, and explore the ordinary day-to-day life in Ancient Egypt. The past is what makes our present real. <br/>Completion time: 50-60 minutes. Some sections of Father and Son are unlocked by checking in at the Archaeological Museum of Naples, publisher of the game. The Father and Son soundtrack is available for download on the official site.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T13:46:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf0/bf0ec29c9c96ad03c7037377b1ddcbf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["TuoMuseo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
