The user will be able to spawn 3D primitives that can auto-destroy after 3 seconds or whenever the user would like it to be destroyed. The tool can read and detect the user input and mouse location. The user will also be able to change the shape and color of the primitives, along with choosing randomization between scale, rotation, and color, or can randomize all. There is also an analog clock to display the current time.<br/></p>\n<p>New Features:</p>\n<p>1. Analog Clock: Displays the current time the user is running the game</p>\n<p>2. Clear All Button: Clears screen of all spawned primitives</p>\n<p>3. 3 Second Destroy: Destroys primitives after 3 seconds of being spawned when the toggle is on</p>\n<p>4. Randomization Dropdown: Dropdown menu to choose to randomize scale, rotation, or color</p>\n<p>5. Randomize All: Randomizes scale, rotation, and color for primitives when the toggle is on</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T06:55:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dd/1ddfb580de22584fb2ed18d76248050e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["korrynversola"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
