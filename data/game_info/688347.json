Use WASD or the Arrow Keys to move Ness, and explore the area!</p>\n<p>I wanted to test out using normal maps, metallic maps, and other fancy effects on 3D pixel art, and so\u00a0I made this project as a challenge to see what I could create. Happy\u00a0Happy Village, being a cult-ridden locale from the game\u00a0<em>Earthbound,\u00a0</em>seemed like the perfect locale for a diorama, and being near to Halloween, it worked out all the better.</p>\n<p>Please note that all of the pixel art textures belong to Nintendo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T08:55:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9af/9afbb5389b8e19ac10cfc6048db0539f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joel_b_dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
