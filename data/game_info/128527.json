This is our first game jam and our first game that we have both published to the public. The week is 57 and the theme is \"ghost story.\" We decided to take an approach of containing ghosts with stories in a tower rather than a story in reference to a short novel.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/789/789ce836780a259090306c0b3e725c96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Later36"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
