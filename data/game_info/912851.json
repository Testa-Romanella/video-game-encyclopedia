Players decide their own\u00a0direction of advancement according to the tasks on the task cards.\r\n</p>\n<p>After each round of dice throwing, a clue card is drawn, and players can choose\u00a0whether to disclose the content on the clue card or not.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>When players are in the same room, any player in the same room can initiate a battle,\u00a0or if there are multiple people in the same room, only a 1V1 battle can take place. This\u00a0is a great opportunity to get items!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The winner of the challenge can randomly draw one of the opponent's prop cards (if\u00a0any). Otherwise, the loser pauses for one round (and can still draw clue cards).\r\n</p>\n<p>Be careful. A series of scary changes will happen after 5 rounds!\r\n</p>\n<p>Please read the relevant rules in the handbook after five rounds.\r\n</p>\r\nPlayer Card\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Each character has its own unique abilities and will be more advantageous in the relevant room. For example, chefs are more proficient in making food, and police officers are more experienced with guns.\r\n</p>\r\nTask Card\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Everyone may draw a special task card, the vampire card. You need to hide your identity for the first 5 rounds to give yourself an advantage.\r\n</p>\r\nItem Card\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Acquiring key items is the key to victory. Likewise, some items are more powerful in the hands of some characters. For example, a revolver will not break in the hands of the police.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>However, some items will have negative effects, so be careful of the temptation!\r\n</p>\r\nClue Card\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Each player can draw a clue card at the end of a round, so vampires should be careful, and the next card may reveal your identity.\r\n</p>\r\nMap\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Players will start the game in the Parlour. A dice can only roll a maximum of three moves, so plan your way forward to win more advantages.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T16:28:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/199/1991df6a2646839cb0b6a282b6826401.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jian :D"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
