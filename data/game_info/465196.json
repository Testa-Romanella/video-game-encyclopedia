Your objective is to guide them towards the black hole. Use your mouse to left click \u2013 hold and drag to create a mirror that the rays can bounce off of. The mirrors you put down get smaller as rays bounce off of them, and they disappear after a while.</p>\n<p>In every stage you\u2019ll have to deal with more and more rays that are faster than the previous ones, but be careful: If any of the rays escapes, you\u2019ll have to capture two others in its place. Make sure the light doesn\u2019t get out of your control.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:57:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/576/576ea2cdeef80ef4d082f6cfd3458710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["akromentos", "YertofeX"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
