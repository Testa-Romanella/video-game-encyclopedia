The objective of the game is simple: avoid having our circle collide with the red squares and score as many points as possible.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, the player must click on the screen to make the circle change direction and avoid the falling red squares. If the circle touches a square of the same color, the player scores a point. The longer the player keeps the circle away from the red squares and accumulates points, the more challenging the game becomes.\r\n</p>\n<p>Square Menace is an exciting and challenging game that will put the player's skills to the test. Give it a try and compete with your friends to see who can get the highest score!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T14:48:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c49/c492802ce0d691446583ef543d4eba74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["caprog"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
