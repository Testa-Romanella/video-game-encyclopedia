You will encounter corrupted objects that, when powered on, will let you and your other cables pass directly through it. This allows for some interesting puzzles that change during their completion. The game's theme is heavily based around image artifacts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T08:11:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/350/350bc03916f1b7fa29f770e0e71160bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lvl3Mage"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
