First of all, Depression is Illness. If you feel depression, ask help from doctors and your close relatives. Second, theme of Compo and Jam was \u201cDeeper and Deeper\u201d , and of course we started to think from \u201cexploration cave/deep sea/deep space\u201d , \u201cspelunky style\u201d , \u201cphilosophic strange game\u201d. But after hours of brainstorming I was exhausted , feel burnout, and said to myself \u201cEureka!\u201d. Burnout and depression have fallen into effect , yes , Deeper and Deeper fall into depression hole. So ,yeah, we decided to make a game about falling into depression.\r\n</p>\n<p>You play as an office worker, and need to make your \u201cvery important\u201d tasks. When you do it well your depression meter goes down , when you make it bad it goes up. Simple concept. Interesting things happen when your depression is level up , so try a different style! I Hope our game is at least interesting and a little bit fun !\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Controls:<br/>Point and click on objects with LMB to interact<br/>Go back with RMB<br/>ESC for exit<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Change log:</strong> <br/>v. 1.1 - Fixed game finish and restart</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:10:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a38/a38cfb802d58a13e208a8e99fccec238.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["luvjungle"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
