This visual novel/text-adventure was inspired by and\u00a0created for the SuNoFes game jam in 2022.</p>\n<p>My aim with making this product\u00a0was to familiarize myself with Twine, as well as further refine my design process. It isn't technically advanced, but I had so much fun making it. Thank you so much to the creator of the jam, and to everyone who tested and helped bring this together!</p>\n<p>... And a big thank you to <strong>you</strong> for visiting this page and playing my game! I am incredibly grateful to you all.</p>\n<p><em>- Titanelie</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T16:33:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72ff1877ddcbcc126d51229ffd5f9545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Titanelie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
