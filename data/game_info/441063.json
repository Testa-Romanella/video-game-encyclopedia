The 2nd row of cards are cells that you can use to hold any one card. Cards can be moved to tableau columns descending by alternating color. More cards can be flipped onto the tableau from the stock pile in the top left. One column of the tableau begins as invisible. Each time cards flip from the stock, a random column is chosen to be invisible until the next flip.</p>\n<p>I didn't have as much time to tune the difficulty as I would have liked. Sorry if it's too difficult!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Art by\u00a0Kenney</li><li>Font:\u00a0Jost</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T06:27:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/5576a08b462fad6689bfa8727675f0fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mapsandapps"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
