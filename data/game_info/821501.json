Fail enough times - and you are out, so just Roll With It.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Each of the side-games is unique and they even control differently!</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Serve the right food to the right customer , but do it quickly or they will get angry!</p>\n\n<p>The objective is simple - avoid the bullets!</p>\n\n<p>Jump over the obstacles, try not to die (pun intended)</p>\n\n<p>Match the amount of dots on dice with the number on the screen before the timer runs out!</p>\n\n\n<p>Keep Dicey alive by feeding it at correct intervals. Don't feed it too little - it'll starve, but don't feed it\u00a0too much, too! Use any key of <strong>directional arrows!</strong></p>\n<br/>Catch a breather. Pet your cat, maybe. Sip some tea. This pause will not last for long, so we hope you'll have a nice break.<br/><br/>\n<p>Also, hit <strong>Escape</strong> to exit the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Colin: Audio Engineer<br/></p>\n<p>Scratch: Game Designer/2D Artist<br/></p>\n<p>Intuwing: Game Designer/2D Artist<br/></p>\n<p>Zyzamo: Game Designer/Programmer\r\n </p>\n<p>BassWasTaken: Game Designer/Programmer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T09:09:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/734/7349b415993cda32698b32068bc8a6d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BassWasTaken", "zyzamo", "Colin5887", "Intuwing", "Scratch96"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
