How confusing can it get!? Merge red, green and blue to create the target colour, without running out of time! If you do, your score will be saved and uploaded for all to see! Using the plus and minus buttons, combine the number of colours as your level to create the random target.</p>\n<p>(It's quite bad and buggy - I spent far too much time on the colour logic... But I learned a LOT and I hope you can still enjoy :p )</p>\n<p>EDIT: Tab to reset mixed colours... Helpful!</p>\n<p>EDIT: Turns out the webGL version works, but can't connect to the leaderboard, so I've added downloadable versions that should connect... Let me know if they don't.</p>\n<p>(Sorry if the UI isn't placed properly... really weird bug with the resizing...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T08:53:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea03a1ed13677545729e50d8385d6c7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["WispStudio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
