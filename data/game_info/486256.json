This is the matter of the whole of mankind. Thinking you can decide on such a thing yourself, without assembling a committee of experts,\u00a0is utmost irresponsible. Luckily, the experts will find you themselves! But which one of them should you listen to?</p>\n<p>The game supports gamepad!<br/>On keyboard use WASD, arrows and space.</p>\n<p>There are two cutscenes that start with showing legs for 3-4 seconds - you may skip those on your second playthrough (lol, if anyone would want to do a second playthrough of this), but please don't skip them on your first - this is the coolest part of the game.</p>\n<p>For this game jam I\u00a0wanted to draw some art myself, experiment with 2D-rigging, skeletal animation, Unity timelines, voice acting and skippable cutscenes while doing something trashy and stupid. I succeeded:) Although I\u00a0had to significantly cut the amount of garbage content I\u00a0planned.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>Main hero doesn't have a voice</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:28:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a34c45b5b963c8e7dfa3d63723b827.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Igor Konyakhin"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
