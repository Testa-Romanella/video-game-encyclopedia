After the previous round's winner picks the stage every player runs, jumps, and punches until only one remains. After a round ends the losers get to select a card that will grant them upgrades or powerful abilities. Gameplay only ends when you get bored and turn it off, so enjoy the infinite potential that awaits you!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCurrently only available on windows.
