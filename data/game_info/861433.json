Its combat takes inspiration from Japanese arcade shooters, but the story and world are structured like an action-RPG. You'll explore different locations, make friends, solve puzzles, and acquire items. Bosses will put your skills to the test, but you'll only have to defeat each one once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Vacant Kingdom you explore a whimsical yet desolate land and try to rally its adrift people by solving their problems. On the way you'll meet a colourful cast of characters. Like a chef who only knows one recipe, a nefarious wizard who wields the dark power of obtuse riddles, and a robot who is programmed to teach the world about insects.<br/><br/><h3>Key Gamer Features</h3><ul><li>Challenging bullet hell gameplay in a unique action-RPG framework.<br/></li><li>4-6 hours of gameplay.<br/></li><li>Defeat 9 fearsome bosses.<br/></li><li>3 levels of difficulty to suit beginners and veterans alike.<br/></li><li>Discover a variety of equipment and weapons.<br/></li><li>Explore and uncover its secrets of a haunted resort, an abandoned bathhouse, and more.<br/></li><li>Solve perplexing puzzles to proceed through the world.<br/></li><li>Befriend a cast of quirky characters.</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T06:34:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edf/edf91abd3758bec22bcd8010b9384250.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["shru"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["shru"], "esrb_rating": null}
