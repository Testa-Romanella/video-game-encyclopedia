Melt (kill) enemies by shooting them and using your fire ability. However if you get hit by the wind (projectiles), your health will decrease, and your flame will dim and you must transfer your soul before you are burnt out. As you are playing, your own flame will melt your candle, causing your health to decrease.\u00a0Also be aware that using your fire ability will cause your health to decrease and cause your candle to melt. You must multitask attacking enemies with your gun, using abilities, and managing your melting health by transferring your soul to other candles in order to survive.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Controls:</p>\n<p>Shoot - Left Click<br/><br/>Movement - WASD<br/>Dash - Left Shift or Space<br/><br/>Burning Shot - 1<br/>Soul Transfer - 2<br/>Reload - R<br/><br/>Scale UI - Plus or Minus</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Team:</p>\n<p>Andrew Goldstein (fablefox) - Environment Art, VFX<br/>Luke Dobbs - Environment Art<br/>William Chen (Exanite) - Programming<br/>Alex Gallardo (RoboZero) - Programming<br/>Michael Tomadakis - Technical Art, VFX, Shader</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Made for DevLUp Fall 2022 Game Jam.<br/><br/>Theme for the jam was \"Just Pick One\".\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:04:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fe/0fe2c0deebbfd6597daaa1147f81cbfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Exanite", "fablefox5", "QuarterCircle", "RoboZero", "TheSleekGreek"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
