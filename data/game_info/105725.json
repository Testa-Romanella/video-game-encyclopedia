Among them, there is one particular student who seems to be very interested in the school's secrets. One by one, the forbidden knowledge unveils before his curiosity. But...<br/><em>\"When you know something, you will have to exchange something for it...\"</em></p><p>This game has 7 chapters and 5 ending. But I'm pretty sure 50% people can't play chapter 7 and fall down to first ending - The WORST.<br/>Not because it's hard to play, it's hard to get. And make sure: You are in a dark room, alone, \"max\" volume. And remember...Don't just play, look around, or you can't get to Chapter 7. If you're lucky, you won't have to see anything \"creepy\".<br/>And one more thing, remember the numbers.</p><p><strong>Translators: </strong>Greater Good 45 | Blurry Mind | Neku Sakuraba</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/875/8750f9058fd4f4fec24ac55256aff966.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sang Hendrix"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
