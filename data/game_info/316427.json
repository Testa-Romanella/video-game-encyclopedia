They are only allowed to use the basic force spell however much they want.</p>\n<p>In this early testing build, the program restores the student mages mana instantly so that they can cast as much as they want.</p>\n<p>Possible future features:</p>\n<p>- Possible stages with limited mana</p>\n<p>- More dangerous traps to train control and timing</p>\n<p>- More complicated levels</p>\n<p>- More uses for force push (instead of moving the balloon, force back enemies heading to pop your balloon)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c04/c04a2db79bf8dae6433b9ec45f77b412.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mervpls"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
