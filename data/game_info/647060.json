This game focuses on teaching players to add fractions together. <br/></p>\n<p>Players must collect fuel to get rockets to blast off into space. Each rocket requires a different amount of fuel. If the player collects too much fuel, the rocket will explode, but if the player can collect the exact amount of fuel, the spaceship will blast off into space<br/></p>\n<p>The game starts easy and progressively gets harder as the player reaches different levels in the game. We gradually increase the difficulty of the fractions as the player progresses through the different levels.\u00a0<br/><br/>This game was produced by Jon, Cuong, Bev and Tim. We hope you have as much fun playing this game as we did making it!\u00a0<br/><br/>You can see the project details on my github page: https://github.com/timotiousPrime/RocketLauncher<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T06:03:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cf/6cf67261162bbec13e7279404416e675.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["timotiousPrime", "poltak"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
