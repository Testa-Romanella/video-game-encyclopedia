It had really bad technology and was the worst jank that entire year had to offer in indie dev. Ryan Simulator (2022), however, will be a very awesome game with minimal jank and lots of epic Ryan simulation.</p>\n<p>Ryan Simulator is a reboot of the 2021 spawn of the series  (Ryan Sim) and aims to be a fun, light-hearted, unique game featuring Ryan.</p>\n<p>In this demo, you can walk around his room, where the ultimate secks happens on a nightly basis because nobody can resist the perfect and incredibly want-able Ryan.<br/></p>\n<p>The game will offer a simulation of Ryan's everyday life- until he gets a suspicious program downloaded on his computer that allows him to hop into virtual worlds of many kinds. His humble abode houses plenty of mirrors so you can look at Ryan's beautiful mug.
