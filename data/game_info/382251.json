Collect 20 junk and deliver it to the middle of the map to win. Excuse me? What's that? ONLINE MULTIPLAYER???? Invisible hands place you into matches with random strangers, friends, or no-one because most likely the rooms will be empty. That being said...We set up a Discord if you wanted to meet someone to play against/with. In theory there could be 20 concurrent players!? Give it a shot, try the Discord, maybe we can crash the servers together!</p>\n<p>You get a random vehicle every time you enter a match. The van and car handle pretty differently, so make sure you try both!</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/aff0965425ad21657c670faefaadd16f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wyattari"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
