This really soggy, delicious cake. But you can't! This damn grandpa-punk stole your ivories! Get them back so you can indulge yourself in those sweet and perfect bakeries.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn this game you fight another player in order to get to your teeth, which wait for you on the other player's platform. For you to get on the other platform you have to collect pickups that give you special powers allowing you to transform the arena to your favor or your enemys disadvantage - or you can directly influence him to slow down or disturb his game. You can decide how you want to play.\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>ControlsFor Gamepad (recommended) <p>\n<strong>Move:</strong> Left stick<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Jump:</strong> A\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Charge and Attack: </strong>Hold and release B\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Use Ability:</strong> X\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Respawn:</strong> Start\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Rotate Camera:</strong> Right stick\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Pause:</strong> Select / Back<br/>\n</p>For Keyboard / Mouse <p>\n<strong>Move: </strong>WASD<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Jump:</strong> Space key\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Charge and Attack:</strong> Hold and release right mouse button\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Use Ability: </strong>Left mouse button\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Respawn: </strong>R\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Rotate Camera: </strong>Mouse Movement\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Pause:</strong> ESC<br/>\n</p>For Dual Keyboard<p>\n<strong>Player 1:</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Move: </strong>WASD<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Jump: </strong>Space key\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Charge and Attack:</strong> Hold and release F\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Use Ability: </strong>G\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Respawn: </strong>R\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Pause:</strong> ESC\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Player 2:</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Move:</strong> Arrow Keys<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Jump: </strong>Num 0\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Charge and Attack:</strong> Hold and release Num 4\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Use Ability:</strong> Num 5\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Respawn:</strong> Num 7\r\n</p>Soundtrack<p>\r\n\tGet the full OST here for free!\r\n</p>CreditsCake Shift is made by four Game Design students at HTW-Berlin<p>\r\n\tJonas Tyroller - Coding\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYannick Pawils - Coding, Sound, Visual FX, UI, Animation Systems\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSebastian Schneider - Modelling, Texturing, Animation\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTill Holder - Art, Modelling, Texturing, UI\r\n</p>Coaches for this project are:<p>\r\n\tSusanne Brandhorst\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThomas Bremer\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSven Gorholt\r\n</p>Contact<p>\r\n\tFor feedback, bug reports and support you can contact us via E-Mail at \r\n\tplaycakeshift@gmail.com <br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28c52a2444bd8a1f501b97fd1468d72e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cake Shift Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
