It is a Survival-Horror video game with jigsaw and key decisions.<br/>The game is first person, and quite immersive. It is designed in Unreal Engine 4.<br/>I have a playable Demo that I will provide below, where you can see more or less what the final game is intended to be. And I say more or less because if I get financing I intend to use models of characters and some hyperrealist game objects, made using photogrametry.<br/>I am currently working on the project alone, and I must make it clear that I am neither a 3D designer, nor a programmer. But so far I have managed to do and program without problems.<br/>The demo is currently only in the Spanish language, but it is intended, at least to add the language in English.<br/>The scenarios are of a real location, and part of the story has to do with the ancient history of the same place.<br/>For reasons of no spoiler I will not mention anything else about the history of the game apart from the one that comes out in the demo.<br/>At the moment I only have some images to show of the demo. And I plan to soon upload a video in which one or several people try the demo without having knowledge of it before, to see first reactions and scares.<br/>The demo is downloadable totally free from my website www.steelfoundryproductions.com. And I put the page and not a direct link since I am updating it and correcting errors and that is where I upload it again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T03:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f643c89abc39fc5026a0d27c0a7ccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZalordVlc"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
