Try to avoid climbing as much as possible, and hop to adjacent blocks as needed to recover more stamina.</p>The game wont start!!\r\n<p>Sometimes you may need to click the game window once the title screen pops up to get things moving. Then try pressing Z or J.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T07:51:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a3869683153f0592b98b47ed9ffa78f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Paloblancogames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
