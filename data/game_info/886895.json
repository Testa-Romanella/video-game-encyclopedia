In one universe, it is a 1973 film about the Naples Mafia, directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Matteo JWHJ0715, and produced by Domenico Procacci, starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Or perhaps it was directed by Matteo JWHJ0715, and merely \"presented\" by Martin Scorsese. It was called the \"greatest Mafia movie ever made\", and was renowned for its complex depiction of a cycle of violence and trauma, and for its homoeroticism.</em></p>\n<p><em>In another universe, \"Martin Scorsese Presents Goncharov\" is a message found on a shoe caused by a misreading of another film's title, which became a meme on the social media platform Tumblr in November of 2022.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T08:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c1/7c10beac1975e3ae520ba5614ceac3f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["manonamora"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
