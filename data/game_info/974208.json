This game has no real adult content, only Nudity.  If you want to buy adult game, then it may not be able to meet your needs.  But you can still look at the CG in the preview image first, which can help you understand the sexy girls of this game.<br/></li><li>2.  I only have 1920* 1080,1366 *768 monitor. If your monitor is not 16:9, it is recommended to use \"Window Mode\" to play the game (especially with long fish screen).  If the image is mismatched, I apologize to you, it is that I do not have the money to buy advanced monitors for game testing.<br/></li><li>3.  This game is based on the principle of \"good steel is used to the edge\", the funds are basically invested in the characters (character drawing, cg and animation frames), so the skills effect, ICONS and sound effects in the game are all from the Unity Store.  If you are very resistant to these common assets, the game is difficult to meet your needs.<br/></li><li>4.  This game is a VS like game with sexy girls (now there are <strong>3 characters, a total of 3 CG sets, 90 magic, 41 artifacts, 120 talents.</strong>  In addition to the number of characters, the amount of content is already more than most of the ea version of the VS like games), if you want to play a light, can see some sexy girls in VS like game, then you can try this game.  If you want an S-class VS like game like Potato Brothers, this game is difficult to meet your needs.<br/></li><li>5. Some game design of this game is different from other VS like, please read the tutorial. If you prefer fully automatic combat, you can turn on the \"Auto Cast Spell\" and \"Auto Aim\" functions in the Settings.<br/></li><li>6.  The game is a little difficult in the novice phase, but after understanding the game designs and some skills' ability, you can easily kill all enemies (about two or three Run).<br/></li><li>7. If you feel it is easy to die using Icy, you can try to use Sally (take the artifact route), Sister is very hard to die^_^</li></ul><h3> Update log: December 16 </h3><ul><li><strong>1.

Controller not supported!</strong><h3>key Features</h3><strong>\u00b7Dynamic Builds:</strong> With <strong>13</strong> different magic, <strong>8</strong> different artifacts and <strong>over 50</strong> different talents to choose from throughout a run, no two attempts will ever be the same.<br/><strong>\u00b7Precise Control or Auto Attack: </strong>Magic requires you to directional aim and active firing.  But artifacts will automatically attack.  It depends on your own combat style!<br/><strong>\u00b7Magic and Mana: </strong>There are several different types of magic: Bullet, Penetration, Entity, Area, and Assist.  Build that according to your own combat style.   Magic is the main method of eliminating enemies, but it requires manual control and cost Mana.  Please note if you have enough Mana to use magic!  Mana can automatically recharge or recharge by picking up mana stones dropped by monsters.<br/><strong>\u00b7Artifacts: </strong>Artifacts are the minor method of eliminating enemies.  They will automatically attack the enemy, but they are not strong enough and will occupy a portion of Mana.  Please note if you have enough Mana to drive the artifact!  I think you may need some magic to assist^_^<br/><strong>\u00b7Talents: </strong>There are a large number of talents to choose from, which is an important factor affecting build.  Talents are generally used to enhance personal abilities and magic, with little impact on artifacts.  Please try multiple combinations as much as possible, as it may cause a qualitative change in strengthen yourself.<br/><strong>\u00b7Quickly level up:</strong> Kill monsters then gain experience directly!  Don't worry about getting stuck in unupgradable situations like other survival games.  Instead, you may need to pick up gems(mana stones) dropped by monsters to recharge the Mana that you cost quickly by eliminating monsters.<h3>tips</h3>1. The faster you kill monsters, the faster you level up.<br/>2. Magic and artifacts need to be centrally upgraded, and quickly increasing the level of the same magic or artifact can make them more powerful.<br/>3. Please choose a reasonable key button for magic.<br/>4. It is not necessary to learn attack magic in all 6 magic fields, learning one or two assist magic may lead to better survival.<br/>5. Talents have little impact on artifacts. But they can make a qualitative change in magic!<br/>6. Don't rush to pick up items, wait until you need them. For example, only pick up Magic stones when Mana is low.<br/>7. Don't be afraid of BOSS, it's here to give gifts^_^</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T04:18:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/9699a1c726ddaebcb732de7c946520e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TEMagicGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TEMagicGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
