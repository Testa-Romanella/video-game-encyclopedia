I have just started learning Godot through watching youtube tutorials and reading Godot documentations from time to time.\u00a0In this project, I followed Angega studios' space shooter tutorial and tweaked some codes in order to work on the newer version of Godot. I really had fun while doing this project, even if I don't have a background on game development, I was still able to manage to make a playable game.For my\u00a0next project, I will be doing a 2d platformer and hopefully by the end of year 2018, I will be able to make one 3d game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e2/7e25e791eda50972a3f799f6201590e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sikgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
