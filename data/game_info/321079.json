He or she must overcome each room to get back into the real world. The protagonist is forced to interact with objects that create a feeling of confusion and weirdness.</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>The player walks around a Museum filled with ceramics. The player must feed them to a monster blocking the way. If the player drops a pot, then the walls of the room float off into the distances with flesh covered hug eyes replacing them and red-light flashing. The eyes stare at you while Guards spawn in and kill you. To complete the room the player must feed all ceramics to the monster.</p><p>Developer Notes:</p>\n<p>This is a short demo of a game that I made for my independent study. It was my first solo project teaching myself during the development process.</p>\n<p>If you like games that are silly and poorly made then this is the game for you!</p><p><strong>Keyboard Controls: </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n      </p> <p>WASD      </p> <p>Sprint\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n      </p> <p>Shift      </p> <p>Interact/pickup/drop\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        </p> <p>E      </p> <p>Menu\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n      </p> <p>Tab      </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T05:39:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e76/e76fe57d09c418667192586f403c8e01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ethpaw"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
