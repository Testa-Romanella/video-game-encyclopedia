Our memories of a place are fragmented and recursive, histories are personal and public at the same time. The Gothic sequence of descending from public to private to secret places - uncovering greater horrors as we go \u2013 gets twisted around a suburban house. Glass reveals, reflects and conceals, doors should stay shut.</p>\n<p>Too often solitude is seen as something to overcome. Many myths feed on the image of a lone man against the wilderness \u2013 either a literal or metaphorical one. It is to be triumphantly conquered, wrestled down, beaten. There\u2019s a quiet pleasure to immersing yourself in solitude, exploring the loneliness as a landscape. The rich inner worlds of women are rarely seen, as we continue to exist in our houses and in our heads.<br/></p>\n<p>Perfectly Ordinary Ghosts is about all of this and none of this.
