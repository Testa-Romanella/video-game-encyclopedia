On the way to wake up and exit his nightmares he has to deal with creatures that hunt him within his\u00a0dreams. WASD for movement and CTRL for crouch.</p>\n<p><strong>How was Houdini used in your game's development?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>So basically this was my first Game project. It was super fun to experiment with Unreal in combination with Houdini HDA's. I used Houdini and the OSM Building Tutorial to build up my Town-Shape. For the Characters I used houdini to bind the skin to rigs and animations from mixamo. All the models were downloaded as free assets from cgtrader or turbosquid. Last but not least there are some kitbash assets within the project from kitbash3d.com</p>\n\n<p><strong>Besides Houdini, what other tools did you use and what did you use them for?</strong></p>\n<p>Unreal Engine - Game Logic</p>\n<p>Photshop - Textures and for UI Graphics</p>\n<p><strong>List any content that was created before the jam that was included in the final submission.</strong></p>\n<p>None of the used assets were created before the Game Jam.</p>\n\n\n<p>I wish I\u00a0had more time to polish several aspects of the game but unfortunately I just had a few hours every day, so I'm pretty happy about the outcome. Thanks for this great event and for the opportunity in participating in it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ab/8abac892ba63b2b31ce1878494996f04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pirminus"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
