Each attraction \n      features unique and innovative game-play experiences made possible by \n      the Wii U GamePad controller. Depending on the attraction, players can \n      play solo, compete against other players, or even team up to play \n      cooperatively. Up to five players can participate in dynamic multiplayer \n      modes in select attractions.* The experiences change depending on \n      whether players are using the GamePad, a Wii Remote controller or just \n      watching others play on the TV screen.\n    </p><ul>\n<li>\n        Comes packaged with a fun, green Luigi-themed Wii Remote Plus \n        controller.\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Nintendo Land features fun-filled theme park attractions based on \n        Nintendo\u2019s greatest game worlds, including Mario Chase, The Legend of \n        Zelda: Battle Quest, Pikmin Adventure and more. There are 12 \n        attractions in all.\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Different activities take advantage of the second screen of the new \n        Wii U GamePad controller in different ways. For example, simply slide \n        a finger across the touch screen to seamlessly fire ninja stars in the \n        action-based Takamaru\u2019s Ninja Castle. In Donkey Kong\u2019s Crash Course, \n        tilt the GamePad left and right to safely navigate an elaborate \n        obstacle course.\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Dynamic multiplayer that offers different experiences in the same \n        game. Even in the same attraction, the player using the GamePad will \n        have a completely different experience than players using the TV: In \n        Luigi\u2019s Ghost Mansion, the player using the GamePad is able to control \n        a ghost invisible to players using the TV. In Metroid Blast, the \n        player with the GamePad controls an aerial gunship versus the \n        ground-based players using the TV.\n      </li>\n<li>\n        The attractions are easy to pick up and play, but also contains deeper \n        levels of play that are sure to challenge even the most experienced \n        gamers.
