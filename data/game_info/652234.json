Expect a full release in 2022.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rocket Sword </strong>is a fast-paced, 2.5D slash-'em-up game inspired by titles like Devil May Cry, Luftrausers, Defender, and Staggy the Boy Scout Slayer, combining the playing field of a wave-based survival shooter with the expressive combat and juicy visual feedback that character-action games are known for.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Operating the most powerful weapon in the universe, you must mow down hundreds of enemies as stylishly as possible, and earn points towards upgrading your superweapon with new techniques and abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Levels are large open areas, where waves of footsoldiers, military machines, aliens, and other menacing opponents will try to obtain your ludicrous power. Each level, once you've shed enough blood, is punctuated with a unique and challenging boss fight.</p>\n\n<p>This demo is not representative of the final product.
