IT DOESN'T WORK AS INTENDED. I WILL RE-UPLOAD IT AFTER RATING PHASE.\u00a0</p><p>FOR BUGFIXED VERSIONS, PLEASE GO TO THE GITHUB REPOSITORY: github.com/Wall-Jump-Games/Welcome-to-The-Displacement-Facility\u00a0</p><p>This game was madefor The Completion Jam 2020. Artwork was partially provided by\u00a0Shaun Spalding. Sound effects made using jsxfr. Coded with the assistance of Shaun\u00a0Spalding's Complete GameMaker Platformer Tutorial. Help uploading the windows build provided by vortexman135.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a unique platformer all about displacing blocks. You are dumped into a facility with only a gun, and messages from the facility's AI to help you along. All seems normal at first, until you find out that your gun has two modes of fire: normal and displacement. You will use this second mode of fire to traverse 3 levels. Made on a iMac, so no testing was possible on Windows, so sorry about any bugs in that version. I would've uploading an HTML5 build, but GMS2 charges extra for that service, so again, sorry. Hope you enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>P.S: I plan to expand this game post-launch, at some point, but expect MacOS to get updates first, as like I said, I work on that platform for the time being. I hope you choose to re-visit the game when updates are released.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8be4d9118bc8829871c737d2599d098.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WallJumpGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
