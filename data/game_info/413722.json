The game is best played with Xbox360 controllers. Grab and release socks with A, and assemble two matching socks to make a pair. Drop them in the basket to get a point, but beware of your opponents who will try to snatch your pairs and ruin your efforts! A for grabbing, assembling, dropping. Left stick to move your cursor. (soon) Top buttons to dash and stun your opponents<br/></p>\n<p>Jam Site:\u00a0<br/>TAG Lab</p>\n<p>Jam Year:\u00a0<br/>2020</p>\n<p>Diversifiers:\u00a0<br/>Language-Independence (Sponsored by Valve Software)<br/>De-squintify</p>\n<p>Platforms:\u00a0<br/>MS Windows, Mac OS X</p>\n<p>Tools And Technologies:\u00a0<br/>Unity (any product)</p>\n<p>Technology Notes:\u00a0<br/>Currently working on local coop only with up to 4 Xbox controllers, might go inside a browser and online gameplay.
