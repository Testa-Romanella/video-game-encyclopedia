The main feature of the game is black humor and a visual environment, namely the world of penises. Here you have to build the economy and various defensive towers to resist hordes of enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To do this, you can choose different strategies, such as abandoning the economy to quickly build defenses, building the entire map with simple but cheap towers, or building a few, but very strong and durable upgraded towers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the towers can't cope with the hordes of genitals, or some one bespectacled ass was able to slip, then you can use various elemental super-attacks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the game you will find many different levels, both in terms of construction and visuals, from steppes and glaciers to real hell! You'll also find yourself in a pleasant but sometimes tense atmosphere, with a cute soundtrack and surrounded by cocks of all shapes and sizes!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Good luck to you, prove to all the sagging and crooked that you are Alpha here!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T04:08:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cba/cbaef92aca3351999e33e91f55515c92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
