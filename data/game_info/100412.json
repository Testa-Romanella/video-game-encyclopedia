Multiple worlds, levels and aliens are waiting to be blasted.</p>\n<p>Our focus is on using your thumb like the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s shooter games: The faster your thumb, the faster you shoot !! Give the controls a few minutes to get used to, they really work!</p>\n<p>Hidden worlds, different difficulty modes (un-lockable pilots) AWESOME sound track and great retro graphics and sound effects.</p>\n<p>Game starts in easy mode, but Hard mode is as challenging as all our games are, getting the full 100% completion is not for the weak or casual gamer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbc/fbc321cb7f61d28722be3ab2ea6aae00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Orangepixel"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
