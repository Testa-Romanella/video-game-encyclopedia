{"id": 706491, "slug": "lets-survive", "name": "Let's Survive", "name_original": "Let's Survive", "description": "<p>Team Hunter is developing an interactive novel (tentative title - Let's Survive) which takes place in a fictional\u00a0town called \"Central City\". The protagonist is a fresh graduate looking to start work in a new role in ONE Tower. ONE is a conglomerate dealing from pharmaceuticals to logistics and military defence. A key part of their income is from the development of vaccines in the current pandemic.<br/><br/>During the course of the protagonist's work, strange activities starts to occur. The rise of vigilantism and occults. Protestors defying logic just to be part of some activism. Central City seems to have been a magnet for freaks.<br/><br/>But all hope is lost when a crazy hacker tried to conceive a plan that will fast forward an apocalypse. The war against God, as he would've called it. The protagonist, and his friends need to make life-changing decisions. People will die, and the protagonist's choices matter.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>-------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER'S NOTICE<br/></strong>Last updated: 8th December 2021</p>\n<p>This is a <strong>VERY EARLY</strong> prototype of the game.</p>\n<p>This game is a text-based game which will be free to the public.
