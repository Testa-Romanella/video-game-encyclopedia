This device, called the Timelock, will enable Special Forces veteran Sam 'Serious' Stone to return to the time of ancient Egypt and assassinate Mental, saving Mankind from extinction.\n<br/><br/>\nIn a world where cyberpunk meets fantasy and hi-tech devices are mixed with black magic and psychic powers, Sam travels from the beautiful world of ancient Egypt through many diverse planets, confronting hordes of Mental's hideous minions on his way to the final showdown at Notorious Mental's lair.<br/><br/><br/>\nSerious Sam: The Second Encounter<br/><br/>\nSam is back in the all new Second Episode of his battles against the arch-enemy Mental.\nAfter finding the Sirian spacecraft in ancient Egypt, Sam 'Serious' Stone hijacked it and headed for Mental himself.\nBut sadly, this was not meant to be, as Sam lost control of the alien craft and crash-landed in the South American mountains.\n<br/><br/>\nNow surrounded by an even stronger army of Mental's evil forces, Sam is forced to battle his way towards Mental's fortress and put a stop to his plans of world domination once and for all.<br/><br/><br/>\nSerious Sam 4<br/><br/>\nSerious Sam 4 reignites the classic FPS series in a high-powered prequel loaded with an explosive arsenal, intergalactic carnage, and perfectly timed one-liners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\nHumanity is under siege as the full force of Mental\u2019s hordes spread across the world, ravaging what remains of a broken and beaten civilization.
