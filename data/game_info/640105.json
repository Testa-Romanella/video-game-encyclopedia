Multilanguage, Up to 64KB of Lua or Moonscript or JavaScript or Wren or Fennel<br/>\u00b7 Bankswitching support (PRO version only), 8 banks<br/><br/>All these features, free of charge and open source.<br/><br/>So, to learn how to use TIC-80 I had the idea of not making an original game, but a port of an existing game.<br/>It had to be a public domain or shareware game, a game that was not so simple, but not very complex either, and that's where Alter Ego comes in.<br/>At the time I sent an email to Denis Grachev to ask his permission to port his game, but he never answered. Vadim Grigoruk contacted me and told me that he had previously asked permission and that Denis Grachev agreed. So it can be said that indirectly I have permission to do the port.<br/>Game development started slowly and gradually from June 2020 to May 2021 as I was discovering each of the features of TIC-80 through the TIC-80 wiki and the source code of other games and examples, even trial and error.<br/><br/>This game can also be played on the official website of TIC-80:<br/>http://tic80.com/play?cart=1420<br/><br/>This game, not being my property, is free of fees and donations<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T10:41:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a34/a34889afc24fabf1a25a90d948e5c456.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kyuchumimo"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
