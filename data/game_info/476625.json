Any songs you see in screenshots are not available in the public build of the game and are only for testing purposes.</p>\n\r\nOkay, how do I use the editor?\r\n<p>It's simple! Enter the editor, click either \"Edit an existing song\" or \"Create a new song\", if you're creating a new one, please enter the title of the song, the difficulty you are going for, a name for the difficulty, the Discord RPC description, the RPC image, the name of the audio file (must be in <strong>.ogg</strong> format), and the scroll speed.<br/><br/><em>All these can be changed later.</em><br/>Once you have saved the creation, navigate to the songs folder (<strong>{game location}\\ProjectRyborn_Data\\Songs\\{song name}</strong>) and place the audio(.ogg) file in the folder, along with a 1400x1400 image titled \"cover<strong>.jpg</strong>\" for the song cover.</p>\n<p>While you're here, please open up SongInfo_[difficulty].json and set \"EndTick\" to the length of your song\u00a0+ 2000\u00a0in milliseconds.</p>\n<p>Now you can edit your song! Simply enter the editor, click \"Edit an existing song\", open the song you just created, and start creating.<br/><strong>Controls:<br/></strong><strong>A </strong>- Place note in\u00a0Lane 1 at current time<br/><strong>S</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>- Place note in\u00a0Lane 2 at current time<br/><strong>D</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>- Place note in\u00a0Lane 3 at current time<br/><strong>F</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>- Place note in\u00a0Lane 4 at current time</p>\n<p><strong>[Space]</strong> - pause/play song<br/><strong>Scroll up</strong> - Skip forward in song<br/><strong>Scroll down</strong> - Rewind song</p>\r\nYou can also manually edit the song in the \"SongInfo_[difficulty].json\" file if you'd like, the formatting is as follows:\r\n<p><strong>SongTitle </strong>- The title of the song<br/><strong>DifficultyName </strong>- The name of the difficulty<br/><strong>DiffLvl </strong>- The difficulty level of the song<br/><strong>SongFile </strong>- The name of the\u00a0 <strong>.ogg</strong> file<br/><strong>SongDesc </strong>- The description which appears in Discord Rich Presence<br/><strong>ImageID </strong>- The image name for Discord\u00a0Rich Presence (Set to \"projectry\" if you're not an official mapper<br/><strong>BPM </strong>- The song BPM, will be dynamic in the future but is a constant speed for now<br/><strong>NoteBeats </strong>- A list of each individual note location. 1 corresponds to lane 1, 2 to lane 2 and so on<br/><strong>OnTick </strong>- The tick\u00a0(millisecond) that each note occurs on. For example, if the fourth\u00a0value in Notebeats is 3 and the fourth value in OnTick is 6000, there will be a note on land 3 at 6000 milliseconds into the song<br/><strong>Lane </strong>- Currently unused. Will be used for visual effects eventually<br/><strong>ListHold </strong>- Currently unused. Will be a\u00a0list of notes which are hold notes<br/><strong>HoldLength </strong>- Currently unused. Will be the length of each hold note\u00a0in milliseconds<br/><strong>EndTick</strong> - The end of the song, please set this to ~2000 ms after the final note<br/><strong>LocalScaling</strong> - The scroll speed of the song. Scroll speed is calculated as <strong>1,000 \u00f7 LocalScaling</strong></p>\n\n\r\nHow much will it be?\r\n100% free!\r\n<p>The game and all of its features will always be completely free although I may consider taking donations if there is significant interest in the game<br/><br/></p>\r\nSo when will it be available?\r\nIt's complicated.\r\n<p>It is available in a very unfinished state right now but is missing lots of\u00a0features that will be available in the final version. If you're looking for a specific date of when it'll be finished, I'm hoping for some time before December 2020 but that's optimistic and depends on if the project is even finished. A more realistic timeframe would be some time in the summer or autumn of 2021 assuming college doesn't get in the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98d/98d4a324a4c7d621f66a92ad3e88df72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Edepol"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
