The goal of the game is to leave two pieces on the board (one of each color) by following the rule: \"Blue eats blue, red eats red.\" A puzzler that is deceptively simple but hard to master.<br/><br/>Moving pegs. Removing pegs. These two simple mechanics allow for an incredible amount of possible strategies to aim for the each puzzle's solution. Future planning. Piece set-up. These equally simple skills will be gradually honed to tackle the hardest puzzles.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Over a hundred hand-made levels, divided into several specially crafted boards.<br/></li><li> Daily auto-generated levels for a never ending experience.<br/></li><li> A color palette friendly for people with deuteranopia and similar visual complications.<br/></li><li> Several selections of zen music to fully immerse into relaxation.<br/></li><li> In-game options that allow gameplay speed tweaking, suitable for different play styles.<br/></li><li> Fully wordless UI for accessibility that ignores language and age.<br/></li><li> A simple, yet addictingly complex gameplay for everyone to enjoy.<br/></li><li> Pegs.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Once again, thank you very much to everyone that gave their feedback and support that led to this project's creation.
