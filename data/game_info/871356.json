Due to the attention they got and the fact, there is still a small fanbase for the series I have decided to return. Hopefully, this final game is an improvement to the originals and provides a good ending for ONADT.</p>\n<p>The Original Games: (Warning\u00a0officially I'm not a fan of my old content)<br/>Onadt 1 =\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/68083222/<br/>Onadt 2 =\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/70852812/<br/>Onadt 3=\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/74568920/<br/>Onadt 4 =\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/235781549<br/>Onadt 5=\u00a0https://gamejolt.com/games/onadt5/756536</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T06:01:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ef/8ef7ed94d26016b15e7e39c7bd98fbf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mr Chrimbo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
