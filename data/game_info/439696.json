However, they all would eventually become iconic and recognizable all around the world.\u00a0You wanted to become just like them, but your parents would not accept your dreams.</p>\n<p>Instead of living in the urban city, you live in a suburban neighborhood. Instead of using your superpowers for heroics, you're using it for chores and housework. Instead of the world knowing who you are, only your parents and distant relatives know about you having superpowers. Instead of going to school, you are home-schooled.\u00a0Your parents will not let you leave the house\u00a0by yourself because they fear you will accidentally reveal your superpower to the public, thus causing unwanted attention and concern for your safety.</p>\n<p>How do you feel about your parents doing this to you? Do you accept their actions, or do you feel like retaliating? The choice is yours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07effc862e991fd551e35ad2076fdfd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TaylorMan2274"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
