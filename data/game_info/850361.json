We are still highly motivated, so there might be future updates on this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>When all light starts fading from the world, you have no option but to channel an old power, and tap into your shadow to steal back light. Phase between world using your limited Void Energy, collect photons to power the light, and find location of more void energy in the light world.\r\nHow to play:\r\nA &amp; D to move character left and right.\r\nSpacebar to jump\r\nF to phase between Light/Shadow Realm\r\nSpacebar off a wall to wall jump\r\nMechanics:\r\nGame starts off with some Photons and Void energy. Both are constantly depleting. Collect photons from the shadow realm to keep the game going, cross the threshold to COMPLETE THE LEVEL.\r\nCollect void energy from the light realm. This energy is invisible in the light realm, but it's position can be seen in the shadow realm.\r\nIf you run out of void energy, you cannot phase to the Shadow Realm.\r\nIf you run out of photons, it is GAME OVER.;\r\n</p>\n<p>Team:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Sankalp\u00a0Jajodia -\u00a0https://sankalpj.itch.io\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>Advaith Karnad -\u00a0https://axyleneomega.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p>Nikhil Garg -\u00a0https://dratboi.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p>Shubh Singh -\u00a0https://shubhsingh.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Note :- Prior to this jam, none of us had any experience in Unreal Engine whatsoever.
