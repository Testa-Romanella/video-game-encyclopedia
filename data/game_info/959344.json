Once you elliminate all of the enemies in current level, you get bonus points based on the number of humans survived. Occasionally, the enemies capture the humans on the ground, but you can still help them by killing the enemies, who are grabbing the humans. Try to save as many humans as you can! You can use only three smart bombs, which only kills the enemies within the current screen. Make a strategic use of those! In addition to the original Defender game, missile bombs are implemented. Watch out with the missiles falling from the sky!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Arrow keys: move<br/>Shift: stop vertical motion<br/>Space bar: fire laser<br/>Ctrl: smart bomb<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Original Defender:</strong>\u00a0<br/>https://www.retrogames.cz/play_178-DOS.php?language=EN</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-18T00:39:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d07c06a6f89bc429c263942d5546c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heejin Jang"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
