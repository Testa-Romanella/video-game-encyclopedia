You have to eat all the fish to get to the next lake, but giant freshwater jellyfish want to eat you in turn. When you gobble a bigger fish you power-up and everything has to flee in your wake. But this only lasts a few seconds and things return back to normal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An extra life is granted at the score of 6000.</p>\n<p>Notes: For me this version of the game was a joy to code. Well mostly anyway. I didn't implement the fruit bonus (although the different types already exist in the character set) or more than two mazes. In the 8k deluxe version that I hope to complete one day I will implement fruit bonuses and there are some out of the ordinary maze ideas I want to play with. I also have some extra graphics which I would like to add in a graphic demo of sorts, which is gator themed but is actually just an excuse to play with graphic patterns.</p>\n<p>Bug: There's a bug. Sometimes a Jellyfish will get stuck in the home gate. Now here's the weird part. I don't want to fix it. You see I distinctly remember that either in a version of Pac man or some clone version that I played I'm sure I had seen this bug before. The fact is I feel honored to have produced such a historic error.</p>\n<p>Loading: for disk use: load \"*\",8,1<br/>For tape use: load \"*\",1,1<br/>Then type: run and then press return</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0Greetings</p>\n<p>Huffelduff (User handle on the VIC-20 Denial forum)</p>\n<p>Notice: This software is distributed as is without any warranty given or implied.
