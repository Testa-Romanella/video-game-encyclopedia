I would like to release this game later for free too (with a standalone offline desktop steam release for a few bucks).</p>\n<p>Donates are highly appreciated since I just entered college and I am doing my projects for free instead of homework lol, so some kind of financial motivator would be great, otherwise I will just work my ass off without anything in return.</p>\n<p>Even if you do not want to donate anything - thank you for playing, still. Don't forget to leave a comment if something weird happens that you think might be a bug - I haven't done that much of playtesting. I will try to add features even to this demo, but I don't know how often that'll be.</p>\n<p>Controls, Tutorial, etc. are displayed in the game's \"How to play\" section. Thank you for stopping by.</p>\n\n\n<p>This project was inspired by Space Invaders and sort-of Binding of Isaac.</p>\n<p>Music used is by Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T13:38:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c71/c71a381e395315afcade1f97fe6b10c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Red Havoc"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
