It's based on the Drawga series by the wonderful Drawfee Show (https://www.youtube.com/@Drawfee) so some of the art is taken from the show. It does have some of my own pixel art and enemy designs. I am sharing for a love of the show.</p>\n<p>The game probably won't take you more than an hour if you read all the text and sadly ends abruptly due to the show not being finished when I was making it. However I hope you enjoy this little bit of fun and humour, partially my own, partially that of the wonderful Drawfee.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T12:51:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecd52d780f6b549be0ebbd734edd2a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Fluffy Dino"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
