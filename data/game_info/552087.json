And yet, it is up to you to outsmart them and defeat them somehow. Less is more.</p>\n<p>It also fits into the plot of the game. However, I'd rather not talk about it on here.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Game by Wenderly Games.</p>\n<p>Music by Anthony Sabatino.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d98/d98715d410d540f98f5200947b2900eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wenderly Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
