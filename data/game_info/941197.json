I\u00a0didn't continue it beyond that point\u00a0and only made the main idea and a single level in order\u00a0see if people like it so I'd\u00a0know if it's worth keep working on it. Recently I got back to the project, fixed a few things and\u00a0decided\u00a0to share a demo here\u00a0on itch where I also buy other people assets and tools.</p>\n<p>Some background on the game:<br/></p>\n<p>The game is called \"Yellow One\". A cute yellow character on his way to find the most precious treasure his world has ever known! (though this story is not final and may change).\u00a0The game has English and Hebrew interface which can be triggered on the fly\u00a0from the main menu, as I also planned it for the local young audience in my country who hasn't yet learned English. :)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Will you help Yellow One through the puzzled levels of the retro gaming era where the rainbow had only two colors?\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The entire game and the overall idea was built completely from scratch to guarantee a unique fun game which is 100% original, and most importantly with the pixelated \"touch\" from the past - there're also PC Speaker sound effects that I built in PICO-8 game engine. The game itself was built in Clickteam Fusion game engine.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Enjoy and I'd love to hear what you think. :)<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>P.S: There are many ways to die in this game. Try and laugh from what the game has to say to you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T15:02:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/380/380ea69eeb0deeda88c23f1643d9519d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["galshemesh"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
