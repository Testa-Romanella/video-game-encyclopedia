The game offers several endings. Try to achieve all of them.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Making the game:</p>\n<p>This game jam I didn't have a lot of time, and that is why I chose to make a game with a small scope. There are plenty of ways I could improve the game such as a way to see what endings you have completed, bug fixes... But I don't have the time nor will to add those features. Hope you enjoy my submission for the Brackeys game jam.</p><p>Credits:\u00a0</p><p>Button sound effect:\u00a0\u00a0https://freesound.org/,</p><p>Font:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/rainyhearts.font,</p><p>Everything else: me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T00:12:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/832/8325911d1d674a7fd79881944e82cb69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luscsus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
