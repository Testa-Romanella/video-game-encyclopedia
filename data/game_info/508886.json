There is no ending so far and my main focus has been the artwork. I still have a few days so hopefully I will update before the deadline. If not... Enjoy the artwork and walk through the maps. Let me know if you find problems I overlooked and I will attempt to fix them. I just wanted to post it just in case I wasn't able to the next few days.**</em><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits so far:</strong></p>\n<p>Plugins:</p>\n<p>http://sumrndm.site/<br/>SRD_SuperToolsEngine<br/>SRD_HUDMaker</p>\n<p>YEP_MessageCore<br/>YEP_X_ExtMesPack1<br/>http://www.yanfly.moe/wiki/Category:Yanfly_Engine_Plugins</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>https://dos88.itch.io/dos-88-music-library<br/>https://www.youtube.com/user/AntiMulletpunk</p>\n<p>Everything else:</p>\n<p>Melonie Moon<br/>meloniemoon.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T03:42:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b42b8e0c069f5825ced4dff0744013c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Melonie_Moon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
