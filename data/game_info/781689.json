As the player explores the city, scraps placed out in certain areas and paths will have to be collected in order to later access the end of the level. Within the city, you will be able to jump around as well as grind on specific areas, traversing the city in multiple ways. Enemies will be placed out along the city, creating obstacles that you will either need to avoid or kill. Thanks to the game's main mechanic, the hoverboard, this platformer will be more fast paced, with speed being at the centre of the game. At the end of the city, in the arena, the Gigantolotl awaits, ready to crush you. Do you have what it takes to defeat it?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T20:27:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eed/eed1ce22af4857d7c79f78389b97e7b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piepsii", "tetracup", "CHOMP", "Carlsson00", "Eternal-Peaks", "KlitoL"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
