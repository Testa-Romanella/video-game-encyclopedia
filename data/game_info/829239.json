This project is a real challenge for me and teaches me a lot on the Unreal Engine 5 technologies (the game's engine). My goal is to make the most realistic, immersive and faithful game on the Backrooms universe as an indie developer. This wiki will show you all the aspect of the game I want to develop for the release. Many thanks to those who support me along this project.
