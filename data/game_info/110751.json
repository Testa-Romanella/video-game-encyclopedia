You will have to retrieve the missing parts of her spaceship to go back to your home planet. As you may have guessed <strong>Pikmin</strong> was the main inspiration for this. Unlike Pikmin though, the player will not have tiny little creatures helping them. Instead you will have to avoid the monsters that populate the planet as much as possible. But just like Pikmin, before night comes you have to go back to your ship and end the day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1d43b541e58655e7b4e474c19726080.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquareDev", "iaxx", "some-pixel-dev", "fridget"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
