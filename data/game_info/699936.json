It's individual scores are inherited relative to their maximum scores; think of the Chimera scores like EVs in Pok\u00e9mon.</p>\n<p>- You have to actively submit your high score to the leaderboard using the \"Submit\" button, but it will always submit your highest score ever, not your most recent one (unless it's the highest of course)</p>\n<p>- In Battle, if there are many Chimeras on the board they will eventually start glitching into each other. That's because of the way the movement system works and not easily fixable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Sounds from\u00a0https://www.weloveindies.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T08:01:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a3/9a319d7999415d4ab3575445233af8cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ayior"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
