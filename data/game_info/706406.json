The pivotal point in rediscovering our origins liberates us once again in our understanding of self and humanity. In the two rooms, the player can undergo these changes by being immersed in the imagined narrative of our future.\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Space 1 - The Belief to Life and The World\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Cell, Life, Vision\r\n</p>\n<p>The concept of life in the future world is gradually blurred, and most of the mechanical objects are used to replace life itself. The purpose of the concept in the room is to reawaken human beings and think about the process of conceiving life, forming life, living in the world, and finally seeing the new world with two eyes.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Space 2 - The Belief to True Self\u00a0and The Emotional Expression\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Color, Emotion, Expression\r\n</p>\n<p>Because of the high development and mechanization of the future world, human beings want to evolve themselves to a higher form. But during this period, personal thoughts and emotions gradually disappear, leaving only a high level of technology. The precious thing about human beings is that they have deep and complex feelings and thoughts that machinery cannot experience and understand. The core here is to return to real life and the true self as human beings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:48:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0b2f063f8764da8b13db83f4c69cc36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["sophie1412"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
