Nobody can remember when it was built, or who built it to begin with, but all anyone can really say is that it's been around long enough that it had long since fallen apart when the old were young. It's a place lost to time, and one better off kept that way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as Luca, a young drifter who, due to a sudden storm, is in dire need of someplace (reasonably) dry for a night. When the doors shut behind you, you'll have to use your wit and cunning to find a way out, and possibly give a few strangers a hand along the way. However, the shrine is a jealous, desperate thing, and one not content to let you go so easily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will you manage to escape, or will the world leave you behind?<br/><br/><strong>Controls\u00a0 \u00a0 (Configurable in options)</strong><br/><strong>Arrow Keys</strong>\u00a0 -Move/Select<br/><strong>Z\u00a0</strong> -Interact<br/><strong>Shift</strong> - Dash<br/><br/><br/>An entry for the Games Jobs Live Game Parade\u00a0Fall 2021<br/>Theme: Leave Something Behind</p>\r\nLost Carcosa\u00a0\u00a0Level\u00a0 Design, Writer,\u00a0 Event ProgrammerWhymsNarrative\u00a0 Design, Lead WriterChaos1001Artisthttps://www.artstation.com/chaos-1001Forsaken_WaffleComposerhttps://soundcloud.com/user-104422835Additional Resources:GALV\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>Yanfly<br/>Game Dev Market", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T04:38:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/588/5884ed3c6951295b319ba74c50d9cae7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lost_Carc0sa", "Whyms", "foresaken_waffle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
