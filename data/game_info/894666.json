In the blink of an eye, the earth collapsed, and the people of this land plummeted into the abyss.<br/>To rebuild the people's homes and restore peace and order, two heroes built the country - The land of Sunbreak. One of them became the Supreme Ruler of this new land and is known as the Samurai Daimyo, whereas the other went on to protect this country in the shadows and has retreated out of the public eye ever since.<br/><br/>As for now, the Samurai, the ruling class, had for years fallen into the decadence of their greed for power. Scared of the mighty power of Ninjas, they schemed to bring the Land of Sunbreak to the brink of war. Even the Oni sealed hundreds of years ago are now ready to make nasty troubles...<br/><br/>As a young Ninja, you will witness the centuries-old feud between the Ninjas and the Samurai, confront the mysterious Onis in the dark, meet a rebellious genius ninja in an infinite spiral of destiny, and uncover the suspense and conspiracy by your own hands...<br/><br/>The new era of blood and fire is coming soon, is your ninja spirit ready to burn\uff1f<br/><br/>= = = For more game information and massive rewards, please join our official community groups! ===<br/><br/>Follow us:<br/>Website: https://www.pandadagames.com/en/<br/>Twitter: https://twitter.com/NinjaMustDie_EN<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ninjamustdie.en<br/>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4SFmy6hgtnLFFCdhdq_GxA<br/>Discord\uff1ahttps://discord.gg/ninjamustdie<br/><br/>[Auto Subscription]<br/><br/>1.Subscription Duration\uff1a<br/>The duration of every Subscription is a month\uff08Try it free for 7 days for the first time\uff09<br/><br/>2.
