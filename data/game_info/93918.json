If it is cleaned, it leaves peacefully. If it is not cleaned, it becomes angry and smashes things until it is satisfied.<br/></p>\n<p>This is our very dumb take on that story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have three minutes to clean the foot. Tools are scattered around the house to help you. Good luck!<br/><br/>[We released a new version of Ashi Wash! The update has new dialog, a record player, prettier and more detailed graphics, even a VR mode! Check it out!]<br/></p>\n<p>\n<em>This game prototype is 100% free, but your donations encourage us to work on new game projects and help us buy food.</em><em> Thanks!<br/>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Follow Two Glass Hams on Twitter and Facebook! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/0798d59dced9ca699b137b37cc86cfdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TwoGlassHams", "Joolean", "Troy Grooms", "VladiMatt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
