Jon Oz, who's been sifting through pages of a book that shouldn't even have its cover opened, is about to confine himself into a nightmare. Will you end the nightmare when darkness falls? Or will you be a prisoner to your own reflection?<br/>Reflection is a first person survival horror game with puzzle and parkour elements.<br/><br/><strong>Synopsis</strong><br/>Following a traumatic shootout, police lieutenant John Oz is being treated in the Parlak Dag Hospital located in a remote forest. Jon has now unknowingly confined himself into a nightmare by giving into his curiosity and sifting through the pages of a mysterious book belonging to another patient. The orchestrator of this nightmare is a parasite who lives in reflections and empowers itself by feasting on the weaknesses and fears of its victims. Will you allow this parasite to consume you, or will you be able to bury it in the dusty pages of the mysterious book?<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li><h3>First Person Horror Experience</h3> John Oz, who is recovering from a traumatic accident, is facing a supernatural threat in the hospital he was put in to receive treatment. Run and hide from the parasite that is chasing you!<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Realistic Graphics and Atmosphere</h3>  Thanks to realistic graphics and dynamic environment objects, you can interact with the objects in the environment and have a more immersive experience with the game world.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Transforming Rooms </h3>  Although the lack of Jon\u2019s sanity is up for debate, this hospital is certainly no longer a sane place. Rooms and halls move and transform on their own growing or shrinking out of proportion creating obstacles that you must overcome using parkour skills.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Puzzles</h3> You must use your cunning in other areas as well, like fixing broken electric boards and circuit breakers, moving objects, and manipulating the environment in order to overcome the puzzle-like obstacles.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Fear of the Dark</h3>  Your fear gives you away... You mustn\u2019t linger in the dark for too long as it increases your fear level, making it much easier for the parasite to find you. Keep to the light and keep your light source closer to you if you want to make it out of the hospital in one piece.<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T08:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/877/87733bac9f8927a705176bd8c6c1b9e1.jpg", "website": "https://zonexstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zonex Entertainment Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Zonex Entertainment Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
