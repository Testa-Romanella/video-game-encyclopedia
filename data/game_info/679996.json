She's supposed to last 3 day but cause I am dum, I made my game in only one. He's really glitchy and have a lot of issues, but the most important is that I finished it in time (at 1 AM \ud83d\ude13)\u00a0 and that you, player, enjoy him. Don't expect to much from this \"game\" but hope you get a little bit of fun playing it and go check the other games of the jam :)</p>\n<p>Bye</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T10:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50b/50b86d1766169cb3d19e34c798f9c393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hexagone Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
