{"id": 17947, "slug": "savant-ascent", "name": "Savant - Ascent", "name_original": "Savant - Ascent", "description": "<p>Savant - Ascent is an action game. This is a result of the collaboration with the artist, called Alexander Vinter. He is also known as Savant. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay is quite simple in the beginning. The player should shoot, dodge and jump on two spots.<br />\nHowever, while progressing it is becoming more complicated. When you start playing, you have a limited set of skills, but you can pick CDs from enemies to unlock bonuses or to acquire ultimate power. Every new ability, you unlock, forces you to get used to a new tool, so it makes the game process more tricky and challengeable. The player has to collect six CDs to unlock all achievements and get to the final fight. There are a few modes. In the Story mode, you need to finish five levels. After accomplishing it, the player can try the Time attack mode, where you aim to kill foes for a limited time. Alternatively, try the Endless mode. There you have to fight with never-ending units of foes. Every new wave is stronger than the previous one. However, there is an indicator, showing you the location of the new enemies. </p>\n<h3>Art style</h3>\n<p>Savant has composed each song, and it fits in with the environment of the game. There are seven unlockable soundtracks.<br />\nMoreover, in the boss fight, it can seem that you fight to the music beat. As for the graphic, it is simple. There are nice 16-bit images, so the design feels a little bit retro.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:52:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9f/c9ffdb0d86204d5f4296bf68db7e22f9.jpeg", "website": "http://www.savantgame.com", "rating": 3.27, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 888, "beaten": 37, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 25}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 73, "suggestions_count": 479, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 73, "platforms": ["Android", "macOS", "Linux", "iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["D-Pad Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["D-Pad Studio", "D-pad Studio AS"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
