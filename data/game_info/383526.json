Using his powers to rip a portal open to the future, he was able to find a powerful weapon, sitting disassembled in fragments, in the year 3000 AD. Thus, your King\u2019s orders are simple and direct; find the Fragments and return home safely. Additionally, whoever brings back the most pieces will be designated the King\u2019s right hand woman, with all the power that that brings. Unfortunately for the King though, the two women each have their own motives...</p>\n<p>And of course, there\u2019s threats in the future, too. Mainly, there\u2019s the World Organization for Regulation of the Masses, abbreviated \u201caffectionately\u201d as the WORM by the few remaining rebels who fight against it. Even worse is that sex and relationships, being seen as a waste of time that could be spent working, are both outlawed by the WORM (people are created through cloning and other means).</p>\n<p>This means that quite a few people are very, VERY desperate for sex in the future... and on top of all that, if you want to survive, you&#39;ll need to figure out the truth behind the Future Fragments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2024-01-08T23:31:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a98/a98914419a078f03ca9d14192938b2a5.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/HentaiWriter", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 6, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["N/A", "The Future Fragments Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Melon Opus"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
