On the other hand, reality could be tough: time is limited, vehicle is unstable\u2026 Are you brave enough to deliver even in the harshest conditions?</p>\n<p>We have prepared six completely different levels to put your driving skills to the test. We have dynamite, volcano, combat zone, drunk tourists and even giant mushrooms to keep you busy! Oh, did I mention that all vehicles have some kind of stability problems? Who cares! Grab the steering wheel and GET IT DELIVERED!<br/></p>\n<p><em>For the best feeling of the theme we recommend playing the Wobble Strike level, but it could be tough for newcomers. So practice on other levels first</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: WASD for movement, mouse to look around, Esc for pause and menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T08:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/87600d7359a3a02e6b13b14e7786bc06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zapolnov"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
