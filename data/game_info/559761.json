{"id": 559761, "slug": "jelly-shark-2d-game", "name": "Jelly Shark 2D Game", "name_original": "Jelly Shark 2D Game", "description": "<ol><li>Description:</li></ol>\n<p>The initial idea of this game came when I was brainstorming and eating gummy bears. While I was squeezing a gummy bear in my hand, a quick realization occurred that wouldn\u2019t it be a cute and easy animation for me to do for my 2D game? So I decided to go with this idea and selected the characters for this game. The goal of this game is to maneuver around as a Jelly shark, and eat other jelly creatures while avoiding the poisonous ones. Players will only win the game if they collect all the jelly creatures. Although it is a simple game, I tried to include many details such as the instruction page, win page and loose page to my game.</p>\n<ol><li>Development process:</li></ol>\n<p>I started my development process through building the big wireframe of the game. I pre-planned the different scenes, and the basic code to control the player and to switch scenes. The next step was to add in more details to my game, such as the color theme, the player and the enemies. Last but not least, some final adjustments and a lot of tiny adjustments to make the game go smooth.\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>Successes:</li></ol>\n<p>I think the success would be the scene transitions. I used to think they are difficult but I managed to make my scene transitions work smoothly. I also think I successfully coded the part of eating Jelly vs. eating poisonous Jelly. The use of tag makes the coding process so much easier to manage.\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>Failures:</li></ol>\n<p>For some reason, I always encounter problems with WebGL build, and I tried to search online but it did not help. There are error messages popping up while I\u2019m building the game but not when I\u2019m test playing it, so I am guessing that it could be a problem with my settings? I truly want to fix this problem because WebGL is so convenient for others to view and try out online.\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>Lessons learned:</li></ol>\n<p>Always finish the project 1 day ahead, because building a game can take a lot more time than imagined(especially WebGL).</p>\n<ol><li>Future Development:</li></ol>\n<p>If I were to work on this project more in the future, I would make more complicated maps and a lot more levels. I would also want to try to work with more complicated animations in the future. However, I believe I\u2019m still more interested in building 3D games instead of 2D games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e03874b75dcba17b150aa940a2cfd7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GracieGee"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
