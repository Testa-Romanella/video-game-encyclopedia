Arrow keys or WASD to move. Either CTRL key to fire. You'll rotate 90 degrees at the end of each round (\"rnd\"), so keep your eyes peeled.<br/>Start in the script-kiddie Segment (\"seg\"), number 0, and work your way up. Beware; more advanced Segments have had their ports scrambled. Don't get too used to the pattern. If you need a break, hit P to pause. Hit P again to unpause.</p><p>Shooting malware adds to your HP (\"hp+\"). If you get hit by a virus, you'll lose a chunk of HP. Run out, and you'll be disconnected. Hit R to reconnect.</p>This game is in extremely early development. I'll be working hard on it whenever I can. You don't <em>have </em>to pay for it, but I'd appreciate it if you'd tip me some lunch money.<p>Listen for updates at https://telegram.me/segment16</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c48/c4896c17925e68ef4a86ed7781cee493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["dawnbreez"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
