Fight the best warriors from the other clans at the cocaine drop points, like a disco toilet sink or a neighbor's garden (WIP).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Supports 2 to 4 players in local, bots might be added later if I feel like it. Game is very buggy. Most graphics are also just placeholders, might replace them to make it more consistent with the theme. Idk.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Disco Toilet Sink map</p><p>Figure 2: Garden map (wip)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T07:29:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8e/e8e5218fd9d14c4230a12941be144faa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["W4rP1g"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
