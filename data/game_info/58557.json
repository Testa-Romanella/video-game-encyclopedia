The game ends when December ends.<br/>- It might take a few runs to get the hang of it.<br/>- It's not supposed to be hard if you think your moves. Let me know on twitter if you managed to beat it (and how many runs it took).<br/>- The key to completing it lies in mastering your skills (the buttons on the left side). This recharge at the start of each month.<br/><br/>Full instructions:<br/>- You click on nearby tiles to move (you'll know you can move if the outline is yellow).<br/>- After you move to a new tile your stats will change.<br/>- There are skills you can use on the left. The first unblocks locked tiles (the ones you can't move to), click on that skill and then select a column. The second skills lets you jump over tiles, click on it and then select the tile where you want to go. The last one is a shield, click on it; it'll block the effect of the next tile you step on. YES, skills can be comined, for example, activate your shield and jump afterwards.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-22T18:56:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/47d/47db78629385e26eebae3c15921dd15b.png", "website": "https://ludipe.itch.io/adultlike", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
