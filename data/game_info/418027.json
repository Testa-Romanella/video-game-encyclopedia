Obviously it is not polished, or even good, but it definitely taught me that 3 hours isn't very much time in game development. It's lacking music and sound effects as my computer decided to betray me at that part of the development.</p>\n<p>For gameplay you essentially point and click at the creatures before they get to the croweds of people. I made it insanely hard by adding waves and variable speeds at which the creatures run. Goodluck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbc/fbcb249e78438ad813c2f3f12e0c283e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TashaRules93"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
