The game has two endings.</p>\n<p>This is an RPG parody I have worked on and off for\u00a03 years and finally finished for the Going For Old Jam.\u00a0It was\u00a0\u00a0made in RPG Editor, a free alternative to RPG Maker.</p>\n<p>Major Fix! - I just tested the exported game on my computer and found it has a path error. I figured out that was because I had an invalid character (a question mark) in my folder's name. Once I had that fixed, I found that the game insisted on being full screen, which just did not work for the graphics. I re-exported the game and it appears to be fixed. To cut a long story short, if you are having either issue, redownloading the game should hopefully fix it.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Page Turn</p>\n<p>http://soundbible.com/suggest.php?q=page+turn&amp;x=0&amp;y=0</p>\n<p>Dragon</p>\n<p>(Modifications were made)</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/blue-dragon</p>\n<p>Tarvern fire</p>\n<p>(Lost link from OpenGameArt.
