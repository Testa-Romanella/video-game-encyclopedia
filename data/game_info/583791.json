You are trapped here, and to have a chance to escape you need to defeat the Lizard Wizard who rules over the swamp. To your aid, you have the wisdom of\u00a0the Frog Wizard - or maybe you are the one helping him. It depends on how you look at it.<br/>Only one thing is for sure - prepare for battle, bud!<br/><br/>Movement is grid-based and combat is played in turns. Defeat monsters to earn coin and items, or absorb their abilities to use as your own! Explore the map to find chests and crates with valuable loot, or visit Magic Stones to exchange coins to upgrade your stats, get useful\u00a0items, or replenish your health and mana.</p>\n<p>The game was made during 7 days as a submission to the\u00a0Dungeon Crawler Jam 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>W to move forward<br/>A and\u00a0D to rotate<br/>S to rotate 180 degrees<br/>Walk into objects to interact<br/>Click on dialog boxes\u00a0to proceed</p>\n<p>Check out the gameplay video to the right if you're having any trouble!</p>\n<p><strong>If you get stuck</strong><strong>:</strong> Press 'P' to die and immediately return to the frog.
