{"id": 109012, "slug": "pond", "name": "Pond", "name_original": "Pond", "description": "<p>A small game made for the Slow Game Jam about skimming stones on a pond. Click to throw a stone. Click to throw another one. Spacebar to change which hand you throw with (this just changes what way the stone spins). </p><p>This game uses the screen resolution and colour palette of the GameBoy Color because, uh, the other game I'm working on does as well and I didn't change my project settings when I started this one. Also because I'm really enjoying working with low resolutions. </p><p>As always, Windows version untested. Feedback appreciated.</p><p><strong>Update 1.1: </strong>Browser version hopefully works now. Cursor disappears between throws. Full screen enabled for standalone version. <br/></p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #13 of 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48cb94d6e1fcaca54a4d88ff530629aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
