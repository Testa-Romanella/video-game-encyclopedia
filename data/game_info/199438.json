You try to reach the exit in every level, and finish the game with minimum moves. You can flip the board horizontally or vertically, if after flipped, your circle ends up in an empty space.<br/> </p><p>Arrow keys to move, W or S to flip vertically, A or D to flip horizontally.<br/> <br/> There are only 4 levels right now, since it's very hard to design original levels for this game. Any feedback is welcome as always.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/304/304e387ca28d36436fc2a4b56d242629.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bahri Gordebak"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
