Only one member of our team had previous experience with game development ,so we thought it would be a fun way to challenge ourselves.</p>\r\nSummary\r\n<p>When we heard this year's theme we instantly started writing down ideas, we eventually got to a \"Battle Royale\" type game, but with random stats for your character. This idea really stuck with us since we all play Dungeons and Dragons and a lot of strategy games, so we loved the idea of making a character that we can vaguely control in a strategic environment.</p>\n<p>Our Game is called Battle Sheets. At its core it\u2019s a strategic battle royale, with as twist a view mechanic. The goal of the game is as in every battle royale: loot, kill and be the only one surviving but we wanted to be it more strategic thus introducing the view mechanic so that you cant use an action and view you player at the same time, it was inspired by inscription. For the aesthetic we went with a mix between casino gambleing, Old computers/typewriters and a fluf of arcade.</p>\n<p>In this game you create a player with dices. This player is then set in the world and you are limited in giving him orders. You can loot places to gain tickets. These tickets are printed to your booth and can be placed in a scanner for a single use effect. You can eat to heal, put on armour for defence, put on boots for speed or use a sword to walk to a player and attack them.</p>\n<p>You have to thenk when to use what, because each card takes a set amount of time. Like putting on a helment costs 4 seconds, but attacking someone is a duration. When you play a sword you walk towards the closest enemy and attack them for the duration. When you haven't reached the target when the card is time has been depleted you stop attacking and have wasted a card. So always check if someone is close enough to reach them within the duration of the card.</p>\r\nFuture\r\n<p>We are overall satisfied with the end result considering our limited experience and knowhow, but there is still a lot we would like to change:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>There is still a bug that some enemies freeze.</li><li>We wanted a save system with currency and a \u2018\u2019higher tables\u2019\u2019 feature like in poker with higher buyins and higher rewards.\u00a0</li><li>A betting feature that you can bet on yourself. - A loot feature that you get the tickets of the players you killed.\u00a0</li><li>Sound effect for playing different cards.- Feedback for different actions.</li></ul>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game. If you have any constructed feedback feel free to comment.</p>\r\nNote\r\n<p>Please follow the tutorial. It could be a little bit hard to understand.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T16:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/520/52060fa317f9a3f7fea768f91b2a95a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cody-Bolleboom"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
