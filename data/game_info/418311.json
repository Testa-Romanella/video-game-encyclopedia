{"id": 418311, "slug": "stinky-sewers", "name": "Stinky Sewers", "name_original": "Stinky Sewers", "description": "<p>Welcome to the killing floor for poor!<br/>This game is about a hobo living in the sewers. He is being attacked by the dead, wanting to claim these sewers as their home.<br/>Clear 5 waves of zombies, and a special boss wave in the end. Watch the amount of ammo you have (new packs are spawned with each wave).\u00a0<br/>Don't stop, don't let them\u00a0surround you (also fat ones are explosive so be far from them when they die).</p>\n<p>This one is sort of a part of a \"challenge\" that I made up for myself on a journey of exploring all kinds of different engines.<br/>This is a Game Guru game, but wait! I did retexturing of stuff, a bit of remodeling, some scripting with the help of the examples I could find on the forums, added music, styled ui a bit, changed standard menu/win/death screens, altered all kinds of different stuff that I considered annoying (like red screen, heartbeat sound on any scratch received, amount of lives shown in hud when you only have one anyway), etc. So I put some effort into this game actually, not just slapped assets on the map in random places. And I really hope this doesn't look like generic Game Guru stuff that floods the Steam. This doesn't mean this one is good, it's just hopefully not as bad.</p>\n<p>Bugs that I know about:<br/>Rarely the game will close itself right after the actual gameplay starts, not often, just reopen it again - it can happen once in a hundred times, it can happen twice in a row. I wish I could give more professional commentary - but it's just Game Guru for ya.\u00a0<br/>Also the music volume option doesn't work, so enjoy this raw 8-string guitar recording.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53f/53f05e6b5be7fc14bc3ec75681b1da63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Span_King"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
