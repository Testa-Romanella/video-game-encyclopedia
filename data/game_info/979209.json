But one day, you notice something odd. There's a crack in the routine, something is off in all this monotony. And where did all those missing colleague bots vanish off to?<br/><br/>Embark on a truly riddled adventure through mind-bending puzzles spread across three different biomes.

Maneuver through conveyor belt chaos, outsmart spinning guard bots with personalities bigger than their circuits, and dodge off laser barriers like a pro!<br/><br/>But beware! Every misstep could lead to disaster, from triggering contraptions gone haywire to pushing cargo drums just a tad too far. It's a race against mechanical mayhem as you uncover the secrets lurking in the station's walls. Who knew saving the day could be this much fun? There might even be freedom waiting at the end of the journey!<br/><br/>So grab your thinking cap and gear up for a quirky quest unlike any other. \"Bot Patrol\" is waiting for you to join the ranks of robot revolutionaries in the fight for freedom!<br/><br/><br/>In traditional Sokoban fashion the player has to push all scattered cargo containers onto the right target spots to complete a level. Challenge comes from only being able to push, but not pull the barrels. This means every step has to be thought through to not end up in a scenario, where access to a container or its target is blocked.<br/><br/>Beyond the regular gameplay mechanics, Bot Patrol features an abundance of extended elements, that make achieving the goal a lot trickier. Conveyor belts, cranes, energy barriers and button triggers are added into the mix. Not to forget the evil control bots, that will perish the player upon contact.<br/><br/>And since playing the game is supposed to be a hard but fun puzzle challenge and not rage inducting repetition machine, Bot Patrol comes with a gracious infinite Undo, to take that one step back, that went to far. <br/>Or the one before. Or the one before that...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bot Patrol has been developed by solo developer a.mighty.dish over the course of 3 years - as a hobby project next to a day job in AAA game development. <br/>It really started as a last big hobby project to finish before the birth of our first offspring. Natures deadlines are quite definite, so when the game was not really finished in time, development came to a halt between milk bottles and baby steps. <br/>Hot fast forward to two years later - with some small sabbatical time at hand - it seemed too much fun of a game to let it wither someone in the abandoned projects folder of ones hard drive and so Bot Patrol eventually saw the light of day!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T12:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d1/4d1a1b1736117561990865236f7b5540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["a.mighty.dish"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["a.mighty.dish"], "esrb_rating": null}
