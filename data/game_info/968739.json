{"id": 968739, "slug": "substitute-priest", "name": "Substitute Priest", "name_original": "Substitute Priest", "description": "In this point-and-click adventure, you control a priest who is invited to a community at the request of an unknown colleague. There he has to deal with this village over the course of a week and uncover its secrets.<br/><br/>Explore the church and talk to all sorts of NPCs, listen to their sins, and give them advice. Compared to other games in the genre, the focus is not on challenging puzzles, although there are a few of them. This game is more of a story experience with some player choices, made both in dialogue and in actions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In classic point-and-click fashion, you will encounter many quirky characters, both helpful and disruptive. Follow the priest through his days there and help him with the tasks he was given by his predecessor. Stuff like listening to other people's stories will evolve into moral decisions. Not just a simple good or bad answer.<br/><br/>Depending on your sensibilities, this game may also contain mild horror elements and a few jumpscares.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T17:58:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e36f4da750b080de32f92afdfac8fbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Janne"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jokerngesund"], "esrb_rating": null}
