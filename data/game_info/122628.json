If you plant too far away from the buildings, plants will die out due to lack of water. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e40/e401c1dfb993a4a22e0fb52c2d0a52ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["rijnswand"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
