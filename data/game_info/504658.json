I was thinking of multiple ideas when looking through the samples they had given they had a simple Pong game. The paddles were rigid and you had to slam down a key many times to get the paddle to move. So I thought \"This can be improved greatly and while I may not yet know what to do with it, I\u00a0should include an improved version of this Pong.\" So I kept looking at the samples and while none of the others stood out (the little snake game, the tech demos for clicking a mouse or collisions for a box) I\u00a0started thinking about what you can do with Pong. And that reminded me of the biggest iteration on Pong - Brickbrakers! And then looking back at the samples they had one that was a platformer \"demo\" (a tech demo if you will). So I\u00a0then came up with the concept for this experiment:\u00a0Pong/Brickbraker but you are platforming on what you destroy. I think while there are many things that can be optimized and improved on this it was just a stepping stone for me to figure out *how*\u00a0to code and what was necessary for a game like this to function with its simple states of game over, winning, and the start state where nothing can move.\u00a0 I\u00a0hope you like the little demo that this paragraph is longer than!\u00a0 :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:04:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c65b2d8fdef16eb1c80c41b8b8125cd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheUknownGamer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
