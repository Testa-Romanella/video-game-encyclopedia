If you're familiar with either of those games, you'll see what parts of those came together to make this happen.\u00a0I'm very pleased with how it turned out, and I'm even more pleased with how easy the packages I've made over the years with my other games were to implement into this.</p>\n<p>As is my MO, this game is a bit of a living nod to games and genres I enjoy. It's pretty easy to tell what games have inspired it.</p>\n<p>With the scope being so small with this game, and making content for it a very rapid process, I would love very much to make this a full game, so if you enjoy this, feel free to send me an @ on Twitter and let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T05:14:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54fd943e57afe0057344dcd189553a37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 350, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Programancer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
