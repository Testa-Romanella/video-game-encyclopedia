You are an astronaut that landed on mars with SpaceX but we find that in caves and underground zombie martians are roaming about! Luckily you brought a few guns and some ammo, so you can defend you ship and the people inside for as long as possible. (SpaceX and Elon Musk inspire me so I wanted to make an over the top and outlandish game based around that, thus the idea for this twin stick shooter was born).<br/></p>\n<p>Art is from OpenGameArt.com</p>\n<p>UI by Buch - https://opengameart.org/users/buch</p>\n<p>Tileset by MrBeast - https://opengameart.org/users/mrbeast</p>\n<p>UI Gun Icons by congusbongus</p>\n<p>Sounds from Freesound.org<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/389/389b38e9e2e07718113930c8a39d0822.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sokuaisushi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
