{"id": 450264, "slug": "skyscraper-4d", "name": "Skyscraper 4D", "name_original": "Skyscraper 4D", "description": "Skyscraper 4D is a new breed of tower building games that lets you design large, complex buildings with remarkable ease.<br/><br/>In this game, you'll serve as architect, engineer, and real estate developer, all at the same time, as you accumulate money and expand the reach of your real estate empire.<br/><br/>You'll control everything from the shape of your buildings, to the placement of columns, walls, elevators, balconies, kitchens, furniture, and more. The tedious work normally associated with construction has been totally automated, letting you focus on the creative side of things!<br/><br/>Skyscraper 4D is easy to pick up, but it strives to stay as close to reality as possible. That means whatever you design needs to be structurally and economically sound. But not to worry, if you run into trouble there are plenty of nifty warning indicators to help you shore things up.<br/><br/>If you like to build things, you've come to the right place!<br/><br/><br/>==============================<br/><br/><br/>Key Features:<br/><br/>\u2022 Open World Sandbox Game: Construct as many skyscrapers as you want, in a massive, unrestricted city.<br/><br/>\u2022 Total Design Control: In this game, you won\u2019t simply position buildings, you\u2019ll get to design every aspect of the building, including its shape, height, materials, floorplan, and more.<br/><br/>\u2022 Intuitive Tutorial: We\u2019ve created a simple and intuitive tutorial to make Skyscraper 4D as easy to learn as possible.  No prior building design experience is required!<br/><br/>\u2022 Floorpan Tool: You can easily add walls, doors, bathrooms, kitchen appliances, balconies, furnishings, and more to create the floorplan you want.<br/><br/>\u2022 Mirroring Tool: We\u2019ve created a tool that lets you quickly design symmetrical buildings by mirroring all of your design actions across the x and/or y-axis of your grid.  We also offer an option for mirroring your build actions in a triangular fashion.  You can even use them both at the same time!<br/><br/>\u2022 B\u00e9zier Curves: Easily add curved windows or walls to give your building a unique shape.  Just tap on the B\u00e9zier Curves button in the build menu.<br/><br/>\u2022 Helpful Warning Indicators: When you design something structurally unsound, we\u2019ll show you a warning indicator that will explain the problem clearly, and give you options to help resolve the issue quickly.<br/><br/>\u2022 Performance: Skyscraper 4D was built using the Metal API for graphics, allowing us to deliver incredible realism and performance.  Every aspect of the game has been tightly optimized to ensure amazing responsiveness, smoothness, and loading times across a wide range of devices.<br/><br/>\u2022 Realism: We\u2019ve tried to make Skyscraper 4D reflect the real world.  Everything from the visuals of the city (which are loosely based on Manhattan), to the structural and financial components of the game, are intended to mimic reality as closely as possible.<br/><br/>\u2022 Soundtrack: We\u2019ve picked out a nice selection of soothing but exciting songs to help keep you in the zone.<br/><br/>\u2022 On-Demand Resources: We\u2019ve kept the initial app download nice and small to avoid wasting space on your device.  When you open the game on Wi-Fi, we\u2019ll download a few asset packs in the background to enrich the game experience with music and sharper detail.<br/><br/>\u2022 No Ads or Endless Wait Times: You won\u2019t need to do a ton of busy work for no reason, or wait ages for money and resources to accumulate.<br/><br/>\u2022 Feedback Welcome: We are always looking to improve, and we\u2019d love to hear your feedback!
