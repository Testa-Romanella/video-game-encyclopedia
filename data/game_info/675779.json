Chain attacks to get combo bonuses, but\u00a0<em>beware of what\u2019s at the end of the chain</em>!</p>\n<p>As you make mistakes metal blocks start to appear, making it more difficult to create attacks. Whenever the metal bar is full, a new metal block is guaranteed to appear.\r\n</p>\n<p>Get things right and you\u2019ll eventually charge your\u00a0<strong><em>NUKE BAR</em></strong>, which gets you a NUKE you can use to blow stuff up and clear the level. Create a nuke chain reaction to get a ton of extra points!</p>\n\n\n<p>As you progress, metal blocks will start to appear naturally more often, which will force you to make strategical sacrifices in order to keep playing.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>I couldn\u2019t finish title screen and other options in time (like muting sfx or music, resetting the game, detecting game over conditions), but the core gameplay is here. It probably needs balancing too. But such is the nature of Ludum Dare! \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</li><li>The power bars at the bottom indicate whether a nuke will drop or a metal bar will drop next. The nuke bar fills as you do good attacks and combos, or explode a nuke. The metal bar fills every time you make a mistake (your move ends up with your piece beaten). (If you do a combo attack that ends with your piece beaten, the metal bar fills with the combo too!) The original intent was for the CPU to counter-attack every move, so that\u2019s what would fill the metal bar, making the game more and more difficult with time, requiring strategy. But due to time-constraints, I ended up making metal blocks appear randomly more frequently despite the metal bar level. So it kind of ends up confusing to have the bar around. But it\u2019s too late now to change. :P</li><li>I\u00a0developed the game under Chrome, but also tested with Firefox.\u00a0Both seem to work fine, but hopefully there's no serious bugs!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Featuring</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A crappy engine written from scratch! (what was I thinking?! D:)\r\n</li><li>Double-retro vaporwave 16-bit aesthetics/graphics. (We heard it\u2019s all the rage with the kids these days!)\r\n</li><li>A shitty soundtrack loop made by a guy who has zero musical skills!\r\n</li><li>A pesky flickering bug that I have no idea where it is coming from! FIXED!</li><li>GreenSock\u2019s animation library\u00a0and\u00a0Howler\u2019s audio library.<br/>\n</li><li>And \u2026 not much more!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Anyway, we barely made it this time, and it was a lot of fun! I hope you guys enjoy whatever we managed to put together. &lt;3<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mobile Support:\u00a0</strong>Game seems to run fine on a tablet (Android), but on phones there's no scaling so the screen gets cut. Sorry! This would be considered a new feature in my book and would require major changes (I think).</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>LucasVB: Code, music, some of the art, concept.</li><li>m1nus: art, sound effects, concept, QA.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>v0.20:<ul><li>Fixed major bug where getting a nuke with only metal blocks queued in to fall would hang the game. Major bummer for late-stage games!</li><li>Added particle cap to improve performance in huge explosions.</li><li>Fixed issue where too many explosions would make further explosions silent. Now a single sound is played and loudness is adjusted instead.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li> v0.15:\u00a0<ul><li>Fixed the sprite animations not playing, sped up the attack animation and FIXED THE FLICKERING BUG. It was caused by me removing sprites from the rendering list as I\u00a0was drawing\u00a0the list. This messed up when the particles were getting removed off the list halfway through the animation, and messing up the rendering of entities.</li><li>Fixed \"shine\" of selected sprites not animating (pause = true was in the wrong object!)</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5d/e5d66b71305def38a3cfeb4d0afb3673.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["m1nus", "1ucasvb"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
