So when a 3rd rate mystic was apparently possessed live on daytime TV the Brotherhood took notice and your team got the call. Track down the mystic and find out what's really going on. They're probably just another run of the mill fraud but if not we need to find the spirit and this group of talentless hacks before whatever they summoned gets loose.</em></p>\n<p>Talentless Hacks is an adventure starter for the\u00a0Demon Hunters: A Comedy of Terrors RPG\u00a0by Dead Gentlemen Productions.
