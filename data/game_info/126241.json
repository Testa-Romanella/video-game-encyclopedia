Runners up in my list include Gods War, Wing X vs Fighter Tie, Time Burger, Man Bomber and The Castle Crazy Bunny Bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/17225f07638a2316f5c209d6181b93f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drawnder"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
