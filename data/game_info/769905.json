Each ball represents a different type of ball: 1) bowling ball 2) tennis ball 3) basket ball. Can you figure out which ball is which based on their bounciness?\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Purpose</strong>:<br/>This project was my final submission to complete Unity's Jr. Programmer Pathway. It demonstrates Object Oriented Programming principles such as<br/><br/><em>Abstraction </em>(The use of removing complex code / calling on methods)<br/><em>Inheritance </em>(The use of a parent class providing features to a child class)<br/><em>Polymorphism </em>(Overriding the features of the parent class with unique features)<br/><em>Encapsulation </em>(Protecting lines of code so values cannot be corrupted)</p>\n<p>I also had to use Github to create a repository and differing branches. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Methodology</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>For Abstraction, I created the Enable Gravity button, which uses my BallDrop() method. This method utilizes the EnableGravity() function from each of the balls. </li><li>For Inheritance I created a BallMovement class. Each of the type of balls were made a child of this class, and all were able to access the EnableGravity() function from the parent class</li><li>For Polymorphism, I made each ball contain a override method that overrode the level of bounciness from the parent class. As a result, each ball contained a different level of bounciness.\u00a0</li><li>For Encapsulation, I protected the time setting for the dollar sign to disappear. I made it display an error message if the developer accidentally put a negative time (for example, -3 instead of 3). </li></ul><p><strong>Additional notes:</strong></p><ul><li>For some reason, making the build into a WEBGL build messes up the position of the buttons and the text. I still need to improve on this.</li><li>Sometimes the coroutine does not start in the WEBGL build, but it shows no issues in the editor side. Not really sure what's the problem here either. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T08:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fab/fabcf6e232195d4524ce93c9d4983600.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tedman Nguyen"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
