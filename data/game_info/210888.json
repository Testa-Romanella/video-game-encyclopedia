Puzzles are carefully scaffolded and provide feedback to the player as they go!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/974/974899b97358cce23fef68c248a26f54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Osmosis Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
