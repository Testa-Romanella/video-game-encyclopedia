You have three lives and you lose one whenever an enemy gets in contact with you, but you can recover it by stunning enemies with your biolazer gun and phagocytizing the enemy (Eating it alive!).<br/></p>\n<p>The infections (purple dots on the minimap) will continue to spawn as enemies spread a chemical gas around the map (yellow dots).
