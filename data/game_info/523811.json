This game takes input from one user in the form of an integer. Another player then attempts to guess the first player\u2019s input. The program reports back if the second player\u2019s guess was too high, too low, or incorrect. The second player is limited to 5 tries and can choose to restart or quit the program.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T06:42:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c6624c3494d18b4658b00f391c4a793.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bebop56"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
