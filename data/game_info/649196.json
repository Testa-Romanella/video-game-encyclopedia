But with a twist: to get through certain barriers you need to cheat. Inspired by the good old games of days past, you literally have to type in a cheat code when prompted and you'll gain a temporary superpower. That's either a SUPERJUMP or a MEGADRILL. With the superjump you are to just jump over the otherwise insurmountable wall, and with the drill you just bash through it. But take care not to jump with the drill or you'll impale the floor and get stuck there. Nobody's coming to rescue you.</p>\r\nDevnotes\r\n<p>The game was made in Godot 3.3.2 on Linux. Art was made with Aseprite. I didn't have time to add any audio unfortunately, and there are only three levels despite having planned to do more. But that is the gamejam. I do plan on reviewing and cleaning up a few things post-jam, adding sounds and a couple more levels. I do quite like the mechanic I ended up with and I'll see if I can get anything more out of it. Feel free to comment with any feedback if you like. Harsh criticism welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T03:44:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d71/d71368c572ba65c1bddc6c3662551919.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["nyxkn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
