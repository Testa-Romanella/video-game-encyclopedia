I\u00a0created this game-zine by exploring the wound-up distress in my body from my recent\u00a0frustrations over \"is this just me or is this ADD again?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>Side note:</strong>\u00a0</em>Created for the Extra Credits game jam that I\u00a0hosted in March 2019, because what's a good jam host that doesn't make a game for their jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T05:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3de/3de7a53eb5280b8f1b749ecc5dfc816e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["B.
