This game has four different clicks, left, right, middle and double left click. A different color is assigned to each click on the button itself. First, the player is tested with one click at a time, and then once the player passes all their levels they are tested with random clicks.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T05:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/910/910b9e5e980e71398c25a29223390d77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["justin_dileonardo"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
