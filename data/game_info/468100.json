Once the end of the level was reached, the recording would play back all the players actions  with the hazards reintroduced. <br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately I ran to a few complications and due to time constraints there is still a lot left unfinished, but hopefully the core concept is still somewhat evident while playing.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A, D: Movement</p>\n<p>W, Enter: Jump</p>\n<p>Left Click, Space bar: Shoot<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:48:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f0/6f0a9f84c6043c7bf7753fd5a8b472b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RippinPepperoni"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
