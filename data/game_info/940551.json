With many mechanics created just for this game.<br/></p>\n<p>All Animatronics concepts were inspired by results from a fnaf OC generator on  shindanmaker. I said I would make a fnaf game with them so I did.</p><p><strong>Mechanics:<br/></strong>Most of this game's mechanics revolves around the thermostat</p><ul><li>Foghorn The Dolphin , becomes more active if the temperature gets too low. You can revert him if you get the temperature above 70 for long Enough</li></ul><ul><li>Dice The Coyote, will disable your cams if the skrimp in the freezer defrosts, you can refreeze it by having the temp below 60 However you'll have to reboot cams if they become disabled which will take power.</li></ul><ul><li>Bangle The Rooster, starts in the kitchen and will make their way to your door. If they are at your window turn on the lasers and they'll leave, however they will only go back to the end of the hall. To make them go back to the kitchen you will need to dispense Korn\u2122 to lure them.</li></ul><ul><li>Soulless The Hair, waits in the dumpster and will move if cams aren't on.
