You will play the role of a young man who gets traumatic news over the phone and stops caring about himself, his appearance and doesn't know how to express his feelings, you can try to keep them inside or express them, there is no way to know what is the better thing to do. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis short interactive film is based on my experience dealing with people who suffer from depression* and borderline personality disorder*. The goal of this project is to shine lights on those conditions and maybe make people understand more what it's like to live with them. I also suffered from a small depression when I lost my dad at the age of 15, I kept it all for myself and stopped going to school, seeing my friends for almost 4 months.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe short film is made vague on purpose so you can possibly put yourself in his shoe and try to relate more to his character. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOn a technical note, this is also the first game made by this studio to be in native 4K resolution, it was the best way to show the emotion and feelings through the lens of a camera. Ideally to really appreciate the interactive experience you should play on a high-resolution screen. But it will also work fine on any display.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n---<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*People with borderline personality disorder tend to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. Their opinions of other people can also change quickly. An individual who is seen as a friend one day may be considered an enemy or traitor the next. These shifting feelings can lead to intense and unstable relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think, and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person\u2019s ability to function at work and at home.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T08:51:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/062/06253d81947bd67f1fc1a7d226895823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bmc Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bmc Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
