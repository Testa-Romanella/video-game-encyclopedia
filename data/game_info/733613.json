Inside, you can explore the Sagalassos site and its different points of interest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The project\u00a0is built in Unity and features a\u00a0model\u00a0of\u00a0the site created by Global Digital Heritage using 16,688 drone photographs. Sagalassos is also a site of research and excavation for the\u00a0Katholieke Universiteit Leuven's Faculty of Arts and\u00a0Archaeology program. You can learn more about the Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project here.</p>\n<p>This project\u00a0includes two versions:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>A virtual reality experience for PCVR headsets</li><li>A first-person perspective experience for mouse, keyboard, and monitor</li></ul>\n<p>The first-person version is currently the more stable of the two. In future releases, I plan to combine them into a single executable and to flesh out the UI/interaction systems for the VR version.</p>\n<p>I began working on this project\u00a0in December of 2021 for my Master's program as the final assignment for my\u00a0Intro to Digital Humanities course. I hope to continue working on this project in the future and have plans to make the tour a collaborative experience.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>*This project is not affiliated with the\u00a0Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project or Global Digital Heritage.
