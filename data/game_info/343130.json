For the sake of being inclusive, the player is coming out as queer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 8 different endings, each based off of whatever path the player takes.\u00a0\u00a0For each path, (except for the dog and cat path because they are lovely animals that don't judge us) the player can decide if they want the person/people to be accepting or not. From there, a basic story takes place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coming out is never easy. From figuring out the right setting, to finding the right words to say, coming out is super complicated and messy.\u00a0This game just scratches the surface at how it feels to come out.\u00a0This game by no means fulls grasps the topic of coming out. The last thing I want is for this game to make it seem like coming out is straight forward (pun intended).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please feel free to share your feedback, I would love to know how I can improve!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Sprites by\u00a0WithoutPenorPaper\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 itch.io: https://red-baby.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Music by ConcernedApe</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T04:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/965/965a5082716f558adb2dfe32c3341ad0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["emewtwo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
