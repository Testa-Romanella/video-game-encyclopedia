The game was inspired by BBS DOOR games of the mid-90's, and it uses a graphical style of games that were played through a computer terminal (TTY).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs the hero, the player must battle monsters across five different lands to gain the experience needed to conquer the dragon. Long time RPG fans will find the battle system and mechanics very familiar. While on the adventure, the player will meet various allies who will assist the player in progressing through the story. Weapons and armor crafted by the blacksmith will give the player the needed power to complete the adventure.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Subscribe on YouTube | Follow on Twitter | Like on Facebook<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Files<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>TTYGFX_WINDOWS.zip</strong> - Original XNA build for Windows 7, 8</li><li><strong>TTY_GFX_ADVNTR_1.1.7.0_x86.appx</strong> - MonoGame port for Windows 10</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d7/5d77918d9748cc3713f89980e47b87dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Levi D.
