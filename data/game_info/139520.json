Game didn't turn out how i wanted it but I'm proud I pulled through! Thank you guys for hosting a wonderful event!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game was inspired by Loved by Alex Ocias .\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe whole concept of the game was to answers moral dilemmas. Doing so will impact the difficulty of the game. You can either pick the answer that would make the game easier or not that's all up to you.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t This will prompt to player to either play the game as either<em> a player </em>or as an <em>honest person</em>. </p><p>There are 3 endings to get from this game and depending what you pick you can also get different questions (or the same questions multiple times?)<br/></p>\n<em>Sadly, the project didn't exactly go as planned. The difficulty didn't stay consistent with the choices of the player which was difficult to fix on time. It was a good learning experience though! Also sorry for any bugs/glitches in advanced!<br/><br/></em><p>\r\n\tCredits for sound</p><p>\r\n\tthatjeffcarter<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tTheDweebMan<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tradian<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tGreencouch<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tprettzv<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tTurtleLG<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb487fe703aa594c1b7380eb2130c740.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["5TEV3N"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
