Using a regular playing card deck, a six-sided die, and something to record with you will craft monsters, hunters, and stories that can be used as creative exercises or backgrounds for your own fantasy worlds.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p><strong>You'll encounter different scenarios as you discover more about the creature you are hunting</strong>, such as a wounded guardsman or a path of broken-down trees. These scenarios will help you or set you back on your hunt, which will affect your odds in your final showdown with the creature.\u00a0\r\n<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Each creature can be made through a category within the zine</strong>, which determines the scenario in which it operates, questions you may answer about it, and traits it may have. Each new playthrough can have a completely different creature with 50 suggested traits that can be used to create your creature.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>The zine has 8 categories of creatures to choose from, such as:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>The Abomination\r\n</li><li>The Primal Beast\r\n</li><li>The Heretic\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T10:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/013/013c6556707833d86aab5fe99e1cdb02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dying Sun Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
