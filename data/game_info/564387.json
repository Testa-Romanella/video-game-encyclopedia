The game will be based on two characters exploring a Catacomb. See it all linking up? Catacomb - Explorers :D\u00a0Very creative, we know! So In the game you will play as two diffrent characters dedicated for two different things. (Combat &amp; Puzzles) In the game you will have to base your gameplay out of two factors such as (health &amp; sanity) Both characters will have some amount of health but the puzzle solving character will be given sanity due to being afraid of the dark. Skeletons will be haunting the dark and eerie catacomb and you better be prepared and plan your gameplay!<br/><br/>Game credits:<br/>Game director: ZlashY<br/>Lead Programmer: Allyen<br/>Lead Artist (The Only Artist): ZlashY<br/>Programmers: ZultooX, Campino945, Viking and Filip.<br/>Graphical helpers: Filip ZultooX.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T08:52:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cb/5cbaf49b9e2c893d15435869207ee9c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coffing-Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
