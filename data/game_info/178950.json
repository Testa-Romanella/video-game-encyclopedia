Rest are only exes.</p>\n<p>Separate AIBOTWIndows-crahsbugfixed.zip\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>is alternative file to be used instead of the original files if you are having trouble. This version is visually identical to the original one (except for one thank you in credits screen), but Burnerknight got some stack overflow issues that crashed the whole game, this was probably a bug in one command in hollywood language itself. This new version have a workaround to that problem and is compiled with most up to date version of Hollywood, and hopefully fixes that crash issue.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Another update:</p>\n<p>I have now added exes for following formats:<br/></p>\n<p>AmigaOS3</p>\n<p>AmigaOS4</p>\n<p>Linux (x86 and 64-bit)</p>\n<p>MacOS (x86 and 64-bit)</p>\n<p>MorphOS</p>\n\n<p>Especially when it comes to MacOS versions, I dont know how you are supposed to get them to work, but basically you first download the original AIBOTWindows.zip package, unpack its contents to where ever you want, then you add suitable exe file from these new downloads to the same folder as rest of the files are, and you are basically good to go.</p>\n<p>Notice that original game was made and tested with Windows machine, there might be some slight differences between platforms, like FONTS might not display exactly same on every platform, and might be bit off on some of the platforms other than Windows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8e/a8efd4259e084a0dfcc54aab9a2357f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GamesForFun"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
