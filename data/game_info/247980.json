I have already had some ideas (powerups and weapons) but hadn't had time to implement it in the Game Jam.<br/><br/>If you want to, you can check out my other projects here.<br/>Source code will also be uploaded there.<br/><br/>Thanks for playing :)</p>\n\n\r\nClick here to play the Game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e79/e79fab2fde871885eba1e6d440f3b023.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sv443"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
