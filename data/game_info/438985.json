If it is an unidentified developer, I don't know why, I have a proper Apple Developer account, and it was built with it. If it's malicious software, maybe that's because of Unity?</p>\n\n<p>Hello! Thanks for checking out our game!<br/></p>\n<p>This was submitted for the Quarantine Game Jam, and I had two other people working on it with me. The game is a small package of minigames, with some boxes in it as well. Hopefully, this will be updated a few times. It could eventually be ported to iOS and Android, and definitely MacOS (including Catalina) and Linux/Unix.</p>\n<p>Team:.</p>\n<p>Cian Ormond\u00a0 - Programmer,\u00a0 Artist, and Minigame Designer (me)</p>\n<p>Clayton Collins - Musician and Level\u00a0Designer</p><p>Expected Performance:</p><p>ON MAC,\u00a0you need to be running MacOS X El Captain (10.11) and the game works on Catalina (10.15). YOU NEED A 64-BIT PROCESSOR.\u00a0\u00a0On lower spec machines, specifically ones that cannot run Catalina/Mojave, it will probably not run well, but it runs at around 20-30 FPS on the 3D menu screen and 40+ FPS in the platformer game on a Mid-2015 MacBook Pro running an Intel\u00a0Core i7-4770HQ, Intel Iris Pro integrated graphics, and 16GB of RAM\u00a0(my main Mac). On a newer 2018/2019 MacBook Pro 15 inch (Core i7-????, Intel ?????? integrated graphics, and 16GB of RAM, you can get a consistent 40 FPS in the menu and over 60FPS in the platformer. All of these numbers are by my eye.<br/></p><p>ON WINDOWS, you need a 32-bit processor, and it should run from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I will test it on my Windows XP VM, but I cannot get expected performance as it's not on real hardware, and the VM is set up on my Mac, not my PC. I have not performed testing on lower-spec Windows machines,\u00a0 but I can test it on my Surface Pro later.</p><p>ON UNIX/LINUX, you need a 64-bit processor, and that's all I know. I can only test it in VMs, so this may not be accurate. I will test later.</p>\n\n<p>Everything is ours, except for the font, which was marked as 100% Free on https://dafont.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:34:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67c/67c86459020901fc3ff9b3bee39354e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["boeingboi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
