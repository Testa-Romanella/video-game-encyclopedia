Climb a mythical castle while overcoming challenges with vehicles and contraptions of your own design. Use creative platforming, drawing and engineering to summon your way to the top!<h3>Solve puzzles with your own creations</h3>Create more and more complex designs in the editor and pilot them with custom controls that you can assign without limitations, while using wall jumps and momentum to maneuver both yourself and your summons through increasingly difficult puzzles.<br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><br/><strong>The Puzzles</strong><br/>Every level of the game provides a new puzzle for you to solve. The further you go, the harder they get, going from making your way past a chasm to complex challenges that require detailed thinking and design work.<br/><br/><strong>The Editor</strong><br/>Use the editor to create any vehicle or contraption you can think of. Draw your summoned design over multiple layers, then pin the many individual elements of your drawing together to connect them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your pins come with a menu that offers a large variety of options, including assignable keys to motorize your creation. This simple combination offers a near infinite range of possibilities and creative solutions for you to explore through complex physics and engineering.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><strong>Design Sharing</strong><br/>You can save all of your designs, which allows you to reuse and improve them in later levels. The design files are easily accessible outside the game via a folder, allowing you to share them with other players without any hassle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Are you creative enough to summon your way to the top?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T07:20:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/274/27421d1a12b2765312e7b362d7df7a1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magnus Dorra"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Magnus Dorra"], "esrb_rating": null}
