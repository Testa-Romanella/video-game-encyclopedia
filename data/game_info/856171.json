The game allows the player to create a party of &quot;soldiers&quot;, though the implication is that these are regular civilians taking part in a military simulation, and determine their names, faces and loadouts. The player then takes this team through a series of missions, using whichever members best fit the criteria.</p>\n<p>The game makes heavy use of fog of war, making it impossible to see the enemy&#39;s team unless they get within visual range. The player characters can use cover and change the direction they&#39;re facing, which allows them to get the drop on enemies. Everything - movement and reloading or shooting a weapon - requires a finite number of &quot;AP&quot; that replenishes after each turn. Both sides take turns to be the remaining team on the field.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-25T23:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7db/7db7eca7fd7295ef9f63730e27c37eec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["I'Max"], "esrb_rating": null}
