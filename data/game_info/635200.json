If it breaks, you get nothing!</p>\n<p>You use the materials to unlock stages and more creatures to encounter. There's a total of two stages, with 8 different creatures. Don't let the number fool you though some of them are clones with very little differences.</p>\n<p>Thank you for giving it a chance!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T10:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65d74e87eb616e5a3e8774e1b036193b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ssoar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
