Poverty is affecting the people, including yourself and your family.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enough is enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You must breach The Baron's castle and bypass the guards in order to return what is owed. But, can you help everyone? Or will you have your family's safety come before others.</p>\n\n<p>Weave through the randomly generated walls of the castle, avoiding the guards. If you can knock a guard out, you have 3 seconds to run by. If you're chased by a guard, you can use your dash to escape.</p>\n\n<p>We recommend downloading rather than playing in browser as it should run a lot better.\u00a0 If you want to play in browser, we recommend playing in fullscreen to get the best experience.</p>\n\n<p>Made for Mini Jam 46: Justice, using only 5 colours.</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<p><strong>Ollie Montford</strong><strong>\u00a0-\u00a0</strong>UI, Environment and Technical Artist, SFX</p>\n<p>Artstation</p>\n<p>Instagram</p>\n<p>itch</p>\n<p><strong>Utku Gokalp</strong><strong>\u00a0-\u00a0</strong>Programming and Project Compilation</p>\n<p>itch</p>\n<p><strong>Viktoria Shen</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0Character, Pick Up art and Animations</p>\n<p>Behance</p>\n<p>Instagram</p>\n<p>Website</p>\n<p><strong>Jenny Shen</strong><strong>\u00a0-</strong>\u00a0SFX</p>\n<p>SoundCloud</p>\n<p>Instagram</p>\n<p>Website</p>\n<p><strong>Matt Farey</strong> - Composer</p>\n<p>SoundCloud<br/></p>\n<p>Spotify<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T05:01:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b97fd7ccb921a3a59ee53ee608860f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["HeroOfSkies", "Bobby_The_Goblin", "VikS", "Jenny Shen"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
