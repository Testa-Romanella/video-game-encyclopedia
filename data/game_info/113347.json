Rato is a young demon hunter who arrives in a besieged village. He is on his way to the Lady of the Castle to ask her for aid in his search for revenge. This is a stage based strategic RPG. Rato will fight on his own but you are there to watch his battles. Each battle move consumes a Soul Gem and you have to make sure that Rato never runs out. That means exploring the world in search for gems, choosing your battles wisely, investing in some good equipment and sometimes even running from battle. If you enjoy your RPGs with a taste of strategy and maybe some luck, this one is for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/250/250349e2bb4886a47669d3b4eb51a62a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EzekielRage"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
