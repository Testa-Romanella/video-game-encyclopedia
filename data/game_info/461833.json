The smell of gasoline burns your nostrils. A\u00a0tower that defies reality looms before you.</p>\n<p>You've entered <em>The Abyss of Dastroreth</em>.</p>\n<p>If you're encountering issues with the web build, please try the desktop ones. WebGL is finnicky, and isn't as supported of a platform for Unity.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nMoveWASD/Left StickJumpSpace/Controller Button ASprintShift/Left Stick PressOpen/Close Pause MenuESC/Start\r\n\r\n<p>This game was made in a few days for the two-minute horror jam. Fairly light on the horror, but it is what it is.</p>\n<p>For this game, I had three primary goals:</p>\n<p>1. Mess around with actually creating shaders. Using this shader as a jumping off point, I\u00a0created the skybox. I\u00a0also had fun figuring out the shaders on the tower itself and the surrounding landscape. They're not much, but they're mine.</p>\n<p>2. Create some really messy, abstract procgen. My previous attempts with procgen have been heavily structured, and I wanted to do something janky (and hopefully more interesting) with this one. The generation is actually fairly simple, but it's not easy to make a (usually) climbable tower that isn't also trivially climbable.</p>\n<p>3. Do something in the vein of strangethink's works. They've scrubbed the internet of their previous games, but the ones that I played I\u00a0enjoyed immensely. They are made up of inhuman, abstract, beautiful worlds, and this game is a pale imitation. Their work had always been formative to me as an example of interesting works achievable through procgen, but somehow I\u00a0had never made anything inspired by them, which I decided to change. This took as inspiration their game Strange Climber, which I have not played (it was gone before I\u00a0knew about their works), but only seen screenshots and short videos of.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Because I only have a Windows machine, it's the only platform I've tested on. I've posted Mac and Linux builds, but I\u00a0have no idea if they work or not.\u00a0Be aware that they may be buggy, and may not work entirely. If you let me know in the comments, I'll try to resolve the issue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:24:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fc/0fc7c08db4315cfc3d02f1db6c6c3824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Kevin Hutchins"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
