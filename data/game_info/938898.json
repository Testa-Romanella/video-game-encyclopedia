Bertie the Brain was originally built in 1950 by Josef Kates. It allowed users to play tic-tac-toe against a computer AI. I learned about Bertie while researching videogame history, and while creating a tic-tac-toe game might seem overly simplistic or academic, it felt like a unique and fun way to engage with videogame history (I subscribe to a broad definition of \"videogame\" as Bertie the Brain did not have a video display). Bertie the Brain Homage is built using React and written in Typescript. It took less than a day to make, and was a fun micro-project.</p>\n<p><strong>TOOLS<br/></strong>Bertie the Brain Homage was created using React and Typescript.\u00a0 You can see the source code on GitHub.\u00a0\u00a0Feel free to fork and modify it as you see fit. \u00a0The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and was embedded within an Iframe and uploaded to Itch.io.\u00a0\u00a0For more info on how to get a React project working on Itch.io, take a look at this article.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T14:15:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c38/c38c350cd84528639834b69b0f162a17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheRealMattKain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
