I am a new game developer, as this being my first developed indie game. Its not much but its a start. The objective of the game is to go through 10 levels, starting on the first finding the \"Ready Button\" to proceed to the second and so on. Each map differs in size and difficulty all with their own unique design and meant to be play as a single play-through. Good luck.</p>\n<p>I am the sole developer and publisher of \"Where's The Ready Button?\".</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD-Move</p>\n<p>Space-Jump</p>\n<p>L.Shift-Run</p>\n\n<p>Discord: https://discord.gg/K2T9uk7<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8c/c8ca71cac5d0ee08f9e801e758204d7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["CodytheMan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
