I'm in the middle of a thesis so I'm not going to devote much time to this. It's nothing but a console program written in C# with no bus stops or easter eggs. if you actually earn a point or bug splat feel free to link a screenshot to it in the comments.<br/><br/>if there is one I will fix bugs really quickly but like I said this is a joke.<br/><br/>please don't try to give me money for this, give to desert bus instead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["couldntpickausername"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
