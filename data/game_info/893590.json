I want to turn this game into something more but want to get some feedback first. I know a lot of the controls and weapon play can use some improvement but this was a quick prototype to get the game loop out. Ideas I have for the future are bigger level/city, i.e. building you can enter and explore and collect stuff. Inventory system to upgrade weapons and skills to gain access to other parts of the level. Multiplayer to fight zombies with friends. So if you play the game please leave a commit and let me know your thoughts. Thanks, and happy gaming.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T08:22:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc824adf613dd75cb7876b91786f0f9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MenacingMedia"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
