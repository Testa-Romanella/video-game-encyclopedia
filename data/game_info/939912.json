The Species you observe keeps mutating over and over again. You can track these mutations and are able to choose one of three options for each mutation period. By this you can shape the Species as you want it to be, but you can also just leave it be and let it mutate randomly.</p>\n\n<p>The Interface is made for Controller Support but you can also use mouse and Keyboard (WASDQE).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T05:01:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4d/a4d823a12184302a5b1834696008042e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DasRuedi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
