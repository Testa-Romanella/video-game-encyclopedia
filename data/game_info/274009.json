(I did almost everything myself. Even generated the white background noise in Audacity :3 If it wasn't for the time issues i had this would have been a compo entry ^^)</p>\n<p>As always, i'd appretiate a lot of feedback :)<br/>I even allow annonymous comments if you want to say something negative :P</p>\n<p>==================IMPORTANT=====================</p>\n<p>THE GAME ONLY ONLY RUNS IN 1024x768!!!

I'm an idiot B. Using beta tools during a competition is extremly stupid ^^</p>\n<p>(4) Only reload when you're stuck! Your deaths are still counted! (Also remember that there is a 10sec cooldown untill the next scene loads if there are still other prisoners alive)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:07", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SadSmileGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
