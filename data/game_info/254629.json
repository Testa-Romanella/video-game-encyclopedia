Things seem pretty grim until a mysterious, old man named Lao Pi materializes and offers Ral an enchanted badminton racquet.

Determined to rescue his friend, Ral embarks on a journey which will take him from the clouds in the sky to the depths of Hades.   <br/><br/>Navigate through intense, heart pounding traps and obstacles. Discover new and interesting ways to defeat your enemies. Meet a crazy cast of characters including a hockey player who thinks he is a god, a lacrosse player running an insane asylum, and a basketball player who turns his trophy into an actual wife.
