My name's Disco Soul, and Disco is my LIFE! Upbeat, downbeat, smooth or funky, I love it all! But woah! I totally just got transported to an 'Olde Worlde'-type place, and it's ruinin' my groove, sister! </p><p>What am I gonna do in a world without Disco?!<br/><br/><strong>TOTALLY TRUE EVENTS INCLUDED IN THE GAME</strong></p><ul><li> That time I had a rap battle with a snake</li><li> That time I was handcuffed to a vampire</li><li> That time the Soul of Nightcore made a mixtape of me saying stuff in my sleep</li></ul><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/><em>Please note! This is Disco Soul's autobiographical version of events. They may be unreliable, factually incorrect, or plain made-up to make him look good. If we ever get a perfectly reliable chain of events, it'll probably be released as 'Curse of Dogs', and be longer and more fun! Consider this the 'Demo Version', except none of the scenes will make it into the actual 'Curse of Dogs'! Please enjoy this standalone story within the Curse of Dog's world!</em><br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>Holy Moly! I can't believe I finished this game all by myself! What? ChillTaco? qualifiedbadger? Nah, I just dictated what happened to those guys, I did all the hard work myself.
