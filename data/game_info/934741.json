Added two levels with unique designs and gameplay. Including \"raged\" enemies with more health and slightly faster, a boss level with a large enemy that takes 100 hits to destroy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Changed sprites to match the theme, player, and one of the enemies. I also changed the background color to red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 Changed the main menu screen, and added music that is fitting to the theme.\u00a0 (if this doesn't count for the third significant modification I combined multiple significant changes into 1. and 2. because they fall into the same category).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Created by: Corbin Nolley</p>\n<p>Inspiration from the show \"Cowboy Bebop\".\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T08:07:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6a/b6acdf383236c5ffdb372dfaa0745a59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cnolley"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
