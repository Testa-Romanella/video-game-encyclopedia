Based off an old game I've made, hence the reason why the title bar is SpaceDodgeRL. I'd change it, but I can't figure out how to do that without it breaking Godot's compilation...so, maybe later, huh?</p>\n<p>The game is exactly what it says on the tin! Instead of a solo adventurer, diving alone into the depths of a dungeon, you're a soldier in an army. And, as many armies in antiquity did, this army places a lot of emphasis on formation fighting.</p>\n<p>It's a 7DRL, so it's not particularly elaborate and, honestly, most of the time went into trying to get the formations to work at all. But they do (mostly)! Can you survive the war and go home to your family, or will you die in a mass grave in a foreign land? (Don't worry, your buddies will see to it that it's a consecrated grave; nobody wants ghosts!)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T05:28:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a9/6a9ac65a229b8e7253fc3788e3c8d29d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MuffiTuffiWuffi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
