{"id": 289126, "slug": "playbetterwithfriends", "name": "PlayBetterWithFriends", "name_original": "PlayBetterWithFriends", "description": "<p>PlayBetterWithFriends is a game I made back in 2017 or so when first starting creating games with Unity. It's a fairly simple prototype for a LAN multiplayer game but I've had a lot of fun playing it with friends and decided to share it with anyone else willing to play. You enter the game into a infinite loop of killing your friends. Take aim and fire! There are trampolines to bounce in, sniper spots to sit in, health packs, and a small (but helpful) easter egg.</p>\n<p>It's definitely unfinished, and the code is spaghetti, but it works. There are still a few bugs, most of which can be fixed by leaving and joining the game again.</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure to allow the game access to your private or public network. If it prompts you with a window asking to allow access, make sure to say yes or else you will not be able to host or join a game.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:35:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7a/f7af87e729402bbc5d8b271f5bbc41e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RugbugRedfern"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
