There are over 2,000 cities to complete.<br/>\r\nPlenty of cities are easy enough. Some take complex planning. Do them in your own order. Get bonuses for completing countries, continents and contracts.<br/>\r\nSome cargoes are easy to get. Others you have to create in industries. Use existing industries and build your own.<br/>\r\nThe further you get from the start the more strategies you have to use.<br/>\r\nPimp up your transports with bonuses. Last transport delivering gets the bonus.<br/>\r\nThe cities and map are to scale. Current or historical industry placement.
