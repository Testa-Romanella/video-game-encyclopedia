Each scene will give you options/settings to go to. Such as, Work, Home or School. To go to each setting press the corresponding capitalized letter. So to go to work hit W. So on and so forth. This will work for Netflix and Disney+. As well as the out of the Vault hit V. So be read carefully and pay attention if you want to go anywhere or you can stay stuck in a cycle of work, school and home. Like I do!</p>\n<p>Once you've come across a scene where there are\u00a0 no capitalized letters or nowhere to really go you have reached the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To get out click ctrl+alt+esc for Windows, and for Mac I believe will do the trick as well and for Web just exit the browser. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T06:20:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d40/d40efe9d5853f12801dccbe4c49c1df0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AdriannaCoray"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
