You work for a great conglomerate\u00a0machine.</p>\n<p>As a minion, your objective is simple - carry out work for the machine.<br/>Each shift, you must collect packages, and drop them off. Follow the<br/>arrow to work out where to go. Employee of the month is awarded to<br/>whichever minion can deliver the most packages, and keep the great<br/>machine running.</p>\n<p>That guy you are making richer, will probably not even know you exist.</p>\n<p>Every 10 minutes, the shift changes, and the packages will be collected<br/>from somewhere else, and delivered to, well who cares? Follow the arrow.</p>\n<p>All that matters is that you keep that machine working, and make rich<br/>people richer.</p>\n<p>To keep things fun, try and deliver as many packages as you can each shift.<br/>This will help fight off the boredom. Other minions will be racing against<br/>you. Be the best minion, at least you can take pride in that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T02:49:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10ff26e56861fb177e47dde45d261fba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["javidx9"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
