The game is pretty buggy overall. You should have access to four weapons and a couple of power-ups but it doesn't always work.\u00a0</p><p>A game I put together while studying through Unity's Certified Developer courseware. The assets are not mine and the conceptual design belongs to Unity. I put everything together using a game design document and the study videos. I learned a metric ton along the way about every core system in Unity. I probably spent the most time on Lighting and complex Particle Systems. I will write more later when I had time. The resolution is fixed at 960x600. First load can take a significant amount of time and may not work in Edge at all. I recommend Chrome or Firefox. Every subsequent load should be faster because file caching is enabled.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Tab to scroll through 4 different weapons </li><li>1 to summon an ally when you have enough points.</li></ul>\n<p>Updated: Did my best to improve performance and load times as well as getting the pause menu working. Had some trouble with lighting but I think it's fixed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c88990febcc33b945601bf584ad1d549.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Captain"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
