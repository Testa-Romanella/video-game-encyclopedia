The characters consist of real people, and they show no emotion other than how much they hate being in the footage.\n\nI kinda wish these videos were livestreamed.\n\nIt's one of the few games to really make me smile, and it's the only game that's like, \"Wait, guys, I don't hate you. Can we make some friends? Maybe we can make some movies?\" the creators tell me. \"I think we're trying to do something different than what we've done before.\"\n\nFor starters, there are no UI controls. This is a game where you'd expect to jump, run, and jump off of walls. Instead, you use your hands to control the camera, shooting, and aiming the gun.\n\nYou're laying on the ground, and you shoot your gun at an IBM terminal. It's kind of like a game of \"Resident Evil\" and \"Contrast.\" The PC version feels like a less accurate version of the original, and the motion and shoulder movement feel more natural in certain spots.\n\nOccasionally, the camera will move backward, and the player will lose control of the gun, but, hey, that's the game, right?\n\nThe developers suggest you are in a prison, and you have to score</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e11349fb553f01e31d17a595fae0b79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
