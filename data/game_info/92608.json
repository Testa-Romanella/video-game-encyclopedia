Embark simulates thousands of flora and fauna in detail. Time of day, seasons, temperature, and precipitation are modeled in detail. These conditions can have effects that help or hinder your colony. Crops can fail from lack of water or an early frost.<br/><br/><strong>CRAFT</strong><br/>Gather a large variety of materials and craft items with a deep hierarchical crafting item system. With practice comes the ability to build better items, smith more effective weapons and armours, and smelt better ores. Each part of an item affects its effectiveness in different ways. A spear could be made with an iron head and wooden shaft, or it could have a steel head and bronze shaft.<br/><br/><strong>BUILD</strong><br/>Rebuild civilization block by block. Embark\u2019s fully destructible world allows you to build anything from small trading outposts to huge fortresses. Order your people to build complex structures and sit back and watch as they complete them. Your colony depends on you. Your management style may result in a cohesive well oiled military machine or a dysfunctional band on the brink of murdering each other. Reward a skilled craftsman with a larger room to make her more productive but be careful, as her friends may get jealous at the \u201cunfair\u201d treatment.<br/><br/><strong>DEFEND</strong><br/>Defend yourself from multiple threats using a deep combat system which models individual body parts, weapon sizes, character skills, and more. Build the ultimate fort to keep intruders out, but beware! Some enemies can dig, climb, or fly to reach you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/183639ff9799d50046e641f6eeefe099.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 16, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["embark", "Overly Complicated Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Overly Complicated Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
