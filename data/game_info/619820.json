Unknown to them a ruler from another dimension was a big fan of their battle and he also wanted to have a taste of it. He summoned them to his realm (kidnapped he heh) told the\u00a0 to fight him, but they refused, he then gave them a reason too. He fused their bodies together and casted them out of his sight. Told them to look for him and fight him. If they win he would return them back to normal else they'll be like that forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>OBJECTIVE</p>\n<p>Find and defeat the ruler of the realm.
