Yet I managed to shape this game into this unnatural twisted form.</p>\n<p>I also ran out of time and got stuck...but it has always been my dream to make a shit game. Just a trash game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> to move. <strong>WASD </strong>to rotate camera (Really just A &amp; D...). <strong>Space</strong> to progress text.</p>\n<p>Warning for not that great audio balancing. <br/>There's also a second or two of background music from Sonic Unleashed.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you to anyone who plays this. Enjoy your Big Pizza.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:45:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f9/6f9e0e73cbeeeeac3c9c92daf76537ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Norkestra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
