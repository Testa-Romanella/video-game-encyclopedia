This has the quickest, most intimate discussion of the game!\u00a0We don't bite, I promise.\r\n<strong>\r\nTwitter:\u00a0VolleyShot<br/></strong><strong>Youtube:\u00a0VolleyShot<br/></strong><strong>Tumblr:\u00a0VolleyShot</strong>\n<strong>Check out the\u00a0the latest devlog and then\u00a0see the bottom of the page for information about the current demo.</strong>\n<p>VolleyShot is a fast-paced volleyball/shooter hybrid. Players participate in volleyball-style matches using a long primary shot and a secondary shot that acts like a \"set\" to out-skill the opposing team.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Upon release, VolleyShot will feature a single-player challenge ladder, local split-screen play, online matches, and at least ten courts. With the option to mix those courts with different gravity settings, ball types, and intensity settings, no two matches play exactly the the same.\u00a0 To get a better idea, check out this video on the basic court:<br/></p>\n<p>And the most recent video from\u00a0VolleyShot's YouTube:</p>\n<p>A\u00a0 demo for\u00a0VolleyShot is available here on itch. A full Steam release is expected in Fall 2018.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Objective\u00a0 \u00a0</strong><br/>In all modes, teams take turns volleying a ball over a boundary. A team can score in two ways: when the ball makes contact with the court surface on the other team\u2019s side of the court, or when the Return Timer expires. By default, a team has 15 seconds to return the ball to the other side of the court. If they are unable to do so, the other team scores. The Return Timer is reset each time the ball crosses the middle of the court.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/>If you have ever played a shooter, you should feel right at home in VolleyShot. The core mechanics are intentionally simple, but designed to build depth as they are learned and eventually mastered. Players have two main abilities: a long shot, and a set shot.</p>\n<p>The long shot is the blue primary shot that travels in a straight line, bouncing off of walls until it either hits the ball, is caught by the center boundary, or dissipates after a few seconds. The long shot will impart its energy directly into the ball, sending it flying or breaking the drive from the enemy team.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The orange set shot, named after the set maneuver in volleyball, has very limited range and recharges more slowly than the long shot. This shot effectively negates the ball's velocity while raising it in the air a bit. It can be used to stop a fast-moving ball, to set up a spike, or as a last-ditch effort to keep the ball from hitting the court surface.</p>\n<p>Other than the shot types, the other player ability is the jump. In addition to a regular jump, you can push off of walls or, in lower gravity, the ceiling. For the wall jump, the faster you are moving upwards, the more of a boost you will get.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Modes</strong>\u00a0<br/>There are currently three modes of play in VolleyShot: Score, Time, and Practice. Score matches end when a score limit is reached. Time limit ends when the timer expires. In the event of a tie, the game goes will go into overtime, and the first team to break the tie wins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Practice mode, there are no limits, no Return Timer, and the ball is automatically bounced to the other side upon hitting the court surface. Players may also freely change certain settings - including the game speed - from the pause menu.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Options\u00a0</strong><br/>In addition to setting up teams and limits, there are three setting categories to mix-and-match and affect gameplay.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Intensity</strong> - While it is the closest thing to a difficulty setting VolleyShot has, don't think of it that way. It mainly affects the ball's maximum velocity, but it greatly changes the way the game plays.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Ball Size</strong> - There are three different ball sizes: the normal yellow ball, the big green ball, and the small red ball. Their size doesn't just affect your chances of hitting them, it also affects their physics.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Gravity</strong> - There are five gravity settings, all based on the actual gravity of objects in our solar system: Earth, Uranus, Mars, The Moon, and Pluto.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>A note about the demo (updated 08/04/2018):</strong>\u00a0The Public Demo currently features two courts: Gym and Wave.\u00a0 VolleyShot is getting ready to enter Early Access on Steam. When that happens, there will be a new demo along with the option to enter Early Access and play on at least\u00a0five courts\u00a0in both the currently available local play, and also the upcoming peer-to-peer multiplayer.</p>\n<p><strong>Demo Version:</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.0.0.16<br/><strong>Current Version:\u00a0</strong>0.0.1.02\u00a0\u00a0(in development)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e318e39392053fc28a27f96ff6247808.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VolleyShot"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
