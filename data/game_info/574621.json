If someone actually likes the game and wants a ad-free version, request it in the comments and I'll rebuild the game without them.</p>\n<p>Warning: The game has no polish at all, plenty of things don't expect as intended and there is no win condition, you just survive as much as you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T09:56:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e88/e8886b240b5e845d8a439d8e6bd2ed33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valerio Marty"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
