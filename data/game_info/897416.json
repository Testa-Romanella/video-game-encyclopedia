The dungeon layouts aren't perfect as it's really not GB Studio's forte to programatically create scenes/change tiles,\u00a0 so I don't suggest trying to draw the maps out or anything like that, because they may not make sense!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T11:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d588b14e6f34a6dbe0b3ac872347e5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JackOatley"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
