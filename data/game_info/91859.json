Yet you opened Pandora's box, and you did not like what you found inside. <br/><br/>Now something is pursuing you, terrorising you - Something that isn't bound to the rules of our reality. Ghosts? Some sort of demon? You wish you knew, although part of you is also glad you don't. What you do know is that you have to finish what you started - and fast. <br/><br/>Terrified and desperate, the only thing you can think of is to seek the assistance of the old woman who first told you of the ritual. She is the only one who can help you end this nightmare.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4c/a4ce3979181531b67f71d7372a7e6f25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["DDD Wares"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
