Talk to cute girls! Eat some slightly questionable meat! Make an elf cry!\u00a0Stare at a lady's chest! Truly an adventure for the ages.</p>\n<p>There are 4 different endings in total, so don't be afraid to go through the story a few times to see them all.</p>\n<p>This was made for the Tugajam over the course of a month, and was almost exclusively a solo project, barring the music and SFX that was found via various sources, as well as proofreading and extra help from my friend Asterisk. For a full list of sources, check out the credits page.</p>\n<p>Lastly, let me know what you think of the game! I have plans to maybe expand it and give it a lot more polish and perhaps put it on Steam or elsewhere, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear it. Thank you!!</p>\n\n<p>(This game has strong language, sexually suggestive content, and alcohol use.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T12:48:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2e/e2e2f9cecfd871cdfd597552499bc20a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ThunderSalt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
