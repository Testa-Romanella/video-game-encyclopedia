Or have you perhaps seen a badass character do some awesome moves in media even though they are blind because they can hear and sense things? Then this game is perfect for you!</p>\n<p><strong>Objective of the game</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Guide the player through 6 different levels, avoiding traps and other dangerous things this place got to offer. You need to reach the door at the end of the level to clear it but to open the door you also need to collect the key. And don't worry if the game looks really generic at the start. Once you lose your sight you will start to miss the regular old levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>PC: Use WASD to move, Mouse to shoot the sound ball.</p>\n<p>Android: Left joystick to move, Right button to shoot the sound ball.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b92/b920fede3667f443a923cc82dde29a2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Parrexion Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
