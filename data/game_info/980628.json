Anybody in their right mind knew going to that place was a death wish, a one-way trip to the end of the line. But Sasha wasn\u2019t one to scare easily, she wanted answers and there was only one place those answers held any truth. Her mind was already made up, you just didn\u2019t expect her to do it without you.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTwelve sleepless nights later and you finally get the call.
