Game control is not just easy, it\u2019s very easy. The bomb hatch is always open, simply press ANY key and the bombs will start to fall. Beware of the high buildings \u2013 you don\u2019t have that many parachutes. For the lasybones we have a cheat-system, e. g. infinite parachutes, no going-down for the plane, etc. So, just run our game and see it for yourself. Have a nice bombing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e45/e45fc548a98bb7029ef0acebfda61ec7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeSad75"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
