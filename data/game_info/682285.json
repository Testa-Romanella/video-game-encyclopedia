Try to click on different celestial bodies to move the camera with them.\u00a0But it might get tricky to follow them as your view shifts. Comets will start spawning in the first few moments of the game. Can you click them?!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> If you're having a hard time and become disoriented, left-click on the sun or right-click anywhere to\u00a0reset the camera.
