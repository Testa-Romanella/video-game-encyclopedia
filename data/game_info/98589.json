The longer you hold the button the higher you jump. It will often be necessary to press the button for only a splitsecond.</li><li>Press <strong>R</strong> to restart from last checkpoint (counts as a death).</li><li>Press <strong>return</strong> to restart from the beginning of the level.</li><li>Oh, and the <strong>blue orbs</strong> are checkpoints.
