Only echoes of an ancient civilization can be seen amid the ruins of an increasingly drier planet. Ancient legends, however, survive among the misery, telling of machines capable of turning stones into water. These are fantastic stories, but they still lead desperate people to seek a way out of the certain death of all life on Earth. And the way to uncover the secrets is down, towards the core of the planet, where metal tunnels await, together with insatiable creatures that search for their next prey in the dark.<br/><br/>To the Core is a small project made in two weeks for the LowRezJam 2019 and Buddy Jam 9, with a fixed resolution of 64x64 pixels and procedurally generated levels.</p>\r\nMoveWASDFlashlight Direction<br/>Mouse Movement<br/>Turn flashlight on/off<br/>Left Mouse ButtonDigDirection + Right Mouse Button<br/>InteractCenter Mouse Button (Or 'E')\r\n<ul><li><strong>Game Design:</strong><br/>Marco Vito Oddo (aka Mother Serpent)<br/>Stealthix</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Programming:</strong>\n<p>Marco Vito Oddo (aka Mother Serpent)<br/>Stealthix</p></li><li><p><strong>Music and Sound Design:</strong><br/>Vitor Ornelas</p></li><li><p><strong>Visual resources:</strong><br/>Stealthix</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>This full GitHub repository for the project is open for anyone to see:<br/>https://github.com/marco-vito/Low-Rez-Jam-2019<br/><br/>The license use orientation is on the \"Read me\" file, but in general, you can use any part of the project as inspiration, but cannot copy the full project as if it was your own.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f55/f551be37c4e6fb54ffdc5a30d4a7b2cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stealthix", "Mother Serpent"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
