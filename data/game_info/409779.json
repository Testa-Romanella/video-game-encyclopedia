Fix movement, add parkour moves such as wall jumping and running but as for the game as a whole we are unsure of what we want to do with it.<br/><br/>So we leave it to you, download, test it out, comment what you would like to see, what we could do and more. We will slowly update overtime as we are happy with changes but for now enjoy Hookpoint and help as craft an amazing game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:49:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba2991ae0b0776518d767146c852a3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smash Attack Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
