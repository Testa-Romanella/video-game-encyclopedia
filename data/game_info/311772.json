Relax in the beautiful virtual space, mess around with weird objects and magical abilities, or dig a little deeper to uncover some insider secrets we\u2019ve left for you to find.<br/><br/><strong>So this is a game demo?</strong><br/>Not exactly!  This isn\u2019t a traditional demo in the sense of showing off story or full gameplay \u2013 we\u2019re not quite that far along yet! But we have created some pretty awesome stuff that we\u2019re proud of \u2013 art, environment, effects, magic system, interactions, and virtual presence \u2013 and we wanted to share it as soon as we could.  We hope you enjoy this little taste . . . and come back for the more adventurous entr\u00e9e later! <br/><br/><strong>So if it\u2019s not a game demo, what do I do?</strong><br/>Whatever you like!  We created this virtual space for users to experiment with in VR.  Pick up items, interact with objects, maybe even try casting a few spells.  Keep an eye out for mysterious secrets, or Easter eggs that reveal more about our team and our development.  Or just draw a comfy chair up by the fire and relax . . . and try not to worry about that glowering gargoyle in the corner. . .", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1a/b1a68ef3e38a7226be09923e2c5179bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 377, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Myths"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Digital Myths"], "esrb_rating": null}
