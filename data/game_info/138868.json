No story, no microtransactions, and no DLC; just pure fast action gameplay.\r\n                    </p>\n<p>\r\n                        The ownership of online multiplayer player-vs-player games is becoming more centralized, which creates issues around long-term maintenance. ARIAVERSE does the complete opposite, with a non-centralized server architecture in order to keep the game going.</p>\n<p>\r\n                        By contributing to the community, you not only help improve the game, but also show there are other ways to create games. Rather than relying on a single entity for everything.\r\n                    </p>\r\nWebsite\r\n<p>ariaverse.com</p>\r\nClient System Requirements\r\n<ul>\n<li>SM5 video card - 3gb of memory</li>\n<li>3GB hard disk space</li>\n<li>64bit Intel or AMD Processor</li>\n<li>Windows 7+ 64bit</li>\n<li>Windows XP is NOT supported</li>\n</ul>\r\nServers\r\n<ul>\n<li>Windows Server</li>\n<li>Linux Server</li>\n</ul>\r\nDocumentation &amp; Listing Server\r\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Listing Server</li>\n</ul>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul>\n<li>NGE is missing sound effects</li>\n<li>NGE is missing on hit particle FX</li>\n<li>Bots need improvement</li></ul>\r\nResolved Issues - Patch 0.1.2.1\r\n<ul>\n<li>Server list duplication</li>\n</ul>\r\nSuggestions, Feedback, &amp; Bug Reports\r\n<p>\r\nPlease, feel free to leave any suggestions, feedback or bug reports here on Itch.io.
