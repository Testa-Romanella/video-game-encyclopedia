GO TO THIS GOOGLE DRIVE LINK PLEASE!!!!!!</p>\n<p>This file is broken!!<br/></p>\n<p>GO TO THIS LINK!<br/></p>\n<p>Deserted on Mars (again?), you must take control of your trusty rover bot and retrieve the necessary parts to repair your ship. Needless to say, the \"locals\" aren't quite pleased by your visit and will chase you down on first sight.</p>\n<p>But that's the least of your problems... unfortunately your rover will be your bigger problem due to the following reasons:</p>\n<ol><li>Your rover is poorly designed that you need one finger for each function.</li><li>Your rover runs on batteries for each function. Batteries will run out eventually.</li></ol>\n<p>You either run out of fingers to control the bot, or run out of batteries to control the bot. Either way... well, I'd better not dig into too much details. Good luck, have fun!</p>\n<p>MARS is a game by:</p>\n<p>Brian Teng (@TYCTeng)</p>\n<p>Joey Yeo (@yeojoey)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:24:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c39/c39542fa3c458da8c64c2a2b462b9f58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brian Teng"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
