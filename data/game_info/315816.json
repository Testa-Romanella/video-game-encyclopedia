The friends you made playing online games, the first time you stayed up late, the marathons you had doing what you love.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although you can still do all these things and much more now that you've grown up, the thrill of doing these things for the first time when you didn't have a care in the world is long gone. You're used to it. There are new thrills to be made in adulthood, of course, but this game's goal is to try and make you reminisce about all those memories you made when you were younger, to help you find a newfound appreciation for them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Developer -<strong> Levi Stenton<br/></strong>Playtester 1 -<strong> Stuart Creighton<br/></strong>Playtester 2 - <strong>Josh Gunston</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Assets<br/></strong>Prefabs -\u00a0\u00a0http://www.sweethome3d.com/freeModels.jsp<br/>Audio -\u00a0\u00a0https://freesound.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T11:53:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3cbecc6df227f146f5b995694b51873.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Levi Stenton"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
