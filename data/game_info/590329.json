Perhaps Markus \"Notch\" Persson was lucky that the community chose the theme of \"alone\" this year, which naturally fits with the popular sandbox game's solitary play style. The purpose of\u00a0<em>Minicraft</em>\u00a0is to kill the Air Wizard, the only other sentient being in the world, to ensure you're alone forever. Gameplay is kind of a cross between\u00a0<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Minecraft</em>\u00a0in survival mode \u2014 you can wander the 2D landscape killing monsters in addition to gathering resources to craft things like weapons and armor, but you don't actually build much. This is a recreation based on gameplays.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:10:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f560e61eab6a48f1101ca6ae909eae13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JXD800"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
