It is a zombie shooter platformer where the player plays as Lulu, my dog, in order to rid a carnival from the hordes of zombie dogs that are hungry for brains. Have fun with the boss fight at the end as well. Please note that this game is in alpha stage and I will be releasing more builds in the somewhat near future. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e4/8e458c5932cbc7395046b342a11413bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
