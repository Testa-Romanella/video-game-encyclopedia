But, for reasons unknown, your cell's lock malfunctioned one day, and now all you gotta do is <strong>run</strong>!</p>\n<p>Try to avoid the guards, get hints about the door password with the other prisoners, and run to the exit!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>----------------</p>\n\n<p>This was a college project. The goal was to make a game using C++ and BGI. It is a (somewhat old) system for making games, and it had a lot of limitations. Recently I decided to port it for Gamemaker Studio, but maintaining the exact same limitations and art of the BGI version, and i translated it to english (the original was in portuguese). Hope you all enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99bc43ecd795c58a9eb974090674d316.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roh", "LLamaze", "Spotik"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
