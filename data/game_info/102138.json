With the start of peacetime in the Fourth Age, the Mercenaries' Guild found its new purpose by serving the government. The Guild became the acting police force, at the same time providing help to people who request it. Through the \"Mercenary Request\" system, people can request help from a mercenary to carry out tasks or odd jobs for a reward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Movement / Navigation<br/>Z Key / Enter / Space - Interact / Select <br/>X Key - Menu / Cancel<br/>Shift Key - Dash (Hold)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/320b0b3a2f1ae212e2f6b0a1d6ede80a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Xehryn"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
