BowserJ, the infamous potato-thief has made a global-takeover and stole all the potatoes! He captured bm, one of the most infamous potato protectors in the world. But bm isn't bm, if he doesn't try to break free. Sadly, JJ also removed his body from his head, so bm can only fall and hope that he hits nothing, but that isn't a problem for the young potato protector from Israel! But also, there isn't much time left, until JJ becomes too strong. So, what are you waiting for? Break free, restore the balance in the world and defeat JJ!</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>A, D\u00a0= Control bm (on mobile, swipe over the screen)</p>\n<p>Space = Stop momentum</p>\n<p>Make your way through the maze without hitting an obstacle.
