{"id": 117137, "slug": "omars-oyster-outing", "name": "Omar's Oyster Outing", "name_original": "Omar's Oyster Outing", "description": "<p>Omar, who is the main hero of the game, wakes up in the zombie-infested town of Oysterville. Your goal, as a player, is to help Omar survive for as long as possible by exploring the town, looting its (hopefully) deserted buildings for food and seeking shelter over night. At the same time, you have to keep the zombies at bay, using an arsenal of contemporary weapons such as shotguns, thompson machine guns and grenades.</p><p>If you want to save Omar, you need to find the last remaining rescue chopper hidden somewhere in Oysterville. Hacking into government computers might clue you in on its whereabouts, but beware, such an intensive task demands from you to sacrifice some of the precious Training Points that Omar has gained by increasing his level of expertise. Also, the info you find may be old news or only half useful. </p><p>Included is also the unfinished Omar's Orthogonal Oyster Outing. I put the development of that game on hold because I became involved with some other projects, but I might eventually finish it. All the pieces are done they just need to be put together and polished.</p><p>Omar's Oyster Outing homepage &amp; full instructions<br/></p><p>sinister systems on Patreon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5c/b5c0b5ee81a7fc40620cfb975e7aec6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["charon@ss"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
