The challenge became more popular\u00a0and many people started doing Inktober digitally.\u00a0\u00a0I decided I would create one piece of art for this visual novel every day during October instead of a traditional Inktober.\u00a0 Since Inktober started with ink and most art was black and white, I decided to keep most of the art in this game black and white.\u00a0 The entire process was documented in my YouTube Channel\u00a0and my Tiktok in the form of short videos, so please check them out if you're interested in seeing the whole process!</p>\n\r\nSupport this game!\r\n<p>If you want to support this game or my art, you can donate on this page by clicking at the \"Download Now\" button and naming your own price!\u00a0I really appreciate it!</p>\n<p>If you can't donate, don't worry. You can always support me and the whole Wizard of Ox team by following our social media. I'm also including the social media of our musician since he provided the theme song for this game!</p>\n\r\nJust Dorathy:\r\n<p>Instagram - @thedoraart</p>\n<p>Youtube - JustDorathy</p>\n<p>Tiktok -\u00a0@thedoraart<br/></p>\n<p>itch.io - Dorathy<br/></p>\n\n\r\nLeaping Frog:\r\n<p>Twitter - @aleapingfrog</p>\n<p>Instagram - @aleapingfrog<br/></p>\n<p>Soundcloud - Leaping Frog</p>\n<p>itch.io - Leaping Frog<br/></p>\n\r\nWizard of Ox :\r\n<p>Instagram - @wizardofoxgames</p>\n<p>Twitter - @wizardofoxgames<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T12:27:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d49bae174b885dfc8b8a049fe5c70d1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Wizard of Ox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
