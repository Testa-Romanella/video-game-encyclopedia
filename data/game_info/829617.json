I wanted to get the whole thing done in a weekend, and that sort of happened if you just add up the hours. In practice, it was about three days of work spread over about a month. Still, it was a good exercise in just getting something done and covering all of the things that are needed to make a complete game. The majority of development time was spent on non-game elements such as the GUI and writing the text for this page!</p>\r\nControls\r\nActionMainAlternativeTurnCursor left/rightA/DThrustCursor upWFireSpacePauseEscapePFullscreen mode toggleAlt-enter\r\n<p>You can also use a game controller.</p>\r\nSource Code\r\n<p>You can download the Godot project files below.\u00a0I'm releasing them in the hope that others find them interesting or helpful.
