Dragon Feast is a local multiplayer game, up to 4 players max where you need to complete a series of inputs in order to eat your meal and improve your score but don't be so impatient or you'll risk breaking your fragile plate!</strong></p>\n\n<p>This game was created during the Emotional Game Jam 2023 by the Fearth Theme, with the themes \"Fragile\" and \"Poker Strike\".\u00a0The Fragile theme is represented by the porcelain dishes that can easily break, so you must be careful and respect the right inputs. For the second theme, Poker Strike, we implemented a chance that at the end of a round, a fury mode can start and allows players to spam an input in order to gainmore points and maybe surpass the other players.</p>\n<p><em>Developpers : ANSEL R\u00e9mi,\u00a0AMORIM--FRIGOUT Luc,\u00a0BARBILLON Remy, GARCIA\u00a0Jo\u00ebl,\u00a0CHATEIGN\u00c9 Paul</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T19:29:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6eebf47b74e2f6d984cf55775d459c02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["La Geneze"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
