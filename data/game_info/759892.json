Guide Moe's ship through the rocks and debris to recover cargo left behind from crashes (handily shaped like a crate of bananas).</p>\n<p><strong>Objective</strong>:\u00a0To complete each level, retrieve the crates before the time runs out!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: WASD to rotate the ship facing, and Space Bar to boost in the direction you are facing. But be careful! Boosting is the only way you have to make progress, but you go in a straight line and can't turn while you boost. Also, your booster takes a short while to recharge.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T13:42:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/422/4229be699f35f34d6cd22dd138fe7f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["7isAnOddnumber"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
