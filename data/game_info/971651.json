Anime Visual Novel Vol. 1", "description": "Have you ever wondered <strong>What Is Love?</strong> But you probably got the whole idea wrong. And so do we! That's why we created this widely messed up game, full of weird ideas, wild choices, dangerous game paths, crazy (I mean c r a z y) plot twists where you can try to find an answer to this question by romancing beautiful girls who hide really dark secrets\u2026 Doing exactly what you always wanted to do, but you were too ashamed to admit it (unless you wanted to throw a GMO-free organic banana at a girl, then ... then hell yeah! You will find this in our game!)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Okay, so you are a high school student (how original!) and you meet pretty nice babes on your way. A sweet, joyful neighbour, an ice-cold schoolgirl, a hot young teacher or the cocky school president? Which one do you choose? Or maybe all of them at once? Calm down, nobody judges you. Have fun, laugh, cry or ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). Or do all of the above at the same time? We don't care. We want your money and your soul.<br/>Just kidding<br/>\u2026or not? *evil laugh sound effect*<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Sensei Asami:</strong><br/>\"Life is too short not to learn. And love is something to learn\"<br/>A young, attractive teacher who tries to maintain maximum professionalism in contact with students. She loves reading romances and walking in the park. She always tries to help those students who need it. Oddly enough, however, she avoids eye contact with you \u2026<br/><strong>Likes</strong>: teaching the biology to her students<br/><strong>Dislikes</strong>: be on sick leave<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Miyu:</strong><br/>\"So you're my new neighbor? That's amazing!\"<br/>A sweet girl next door who loves to help everyone around. She is always smiling and has an aura of joy around her. She hangs out with school misfits and loves to cook Japanese delicacies at the soup kitchen volunteering club for those in need. You often see her doing some gardening work.  You also often see a strange figure in the window of her upstairs room \u2026<br/><strong>Likes</strong>: everything<br/><strong>Dislikes</strong>: nothing<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Tsuneko:</strong><br/>\"Our lives means nothing\"<br/>She is called an ice-cold princess at school, because she doesn't stay close to anyone and doesn't get attached to people. And indeed she is quite cold and distant, as well as she does not count on help from others. She also changed schools! Some may wonder why \u2026<br/><strong>Likes</strong>: when no one bothers her<br/><strong>Dislikes</strong>: when someone bothers her<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Emiko:</strong><br/>\"Fine feathers make fine birds\"<br/>Queen bee. The school president, the most popular girl, the daughter of the local wealthy. She believes that nothing is as important as the image, which she cares for with commitment. You saw a picture of her parents in the local newspaper. Their smiles seem strangely fake to you \u2026<br/><strong>Likes</strong>: her chauffeur who drives her to school in a limousine<br/><strong>Dislikes</strong>: walking long distances on foot<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jokes aside, it really does tho. So think carefully before you make any seemingly insignificant decision like: \"Hey girl, sure I can pick up the lipstick you dropped... BOOM you just killed the pope.\"* Okay, maybe we're exaggerating a bit, but your choices really do matter. Do you want to destroy these girls' lives, use their weaknesses and secrets to get into their panties, make them dependent, manipulate them and show them where they belong? Do you really want this? BIG OOF. But maybe you want to be a white knight who will free these girls from their past traumas and give them a bright new future, full of kindness, affection, devotion and warmth? Dude that's even more messed up. Oh well\u2026 I repeat, do whatever you want! Find your answer to the oldest question in the world! <br/>Which came first: the chicken or the egg? Um, not this one. <strong>WHAT IS LOVE?</strong><br/> *This is not a real game situation, take it easy, no spoiler, pick up lipsticks for girls if you like.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Arts so beautiful that you can go blind (the developer of this game is not responsible for any injuries caused by playing)<br/></li><li> Plot so wicked that you can poop yourself (saaaameee)<br/></li><li> Four romanceable characters in development, beautiful girls, each with a completely different character and tits<br/></li><li> Different endings so fricking amazing you would never have expected!
