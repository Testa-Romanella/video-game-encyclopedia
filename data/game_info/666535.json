To welcome you at Freddy Fazbear's pizza! You will be able to enjoy lots of games and activities, but mostly you will be sitting in a dark room at the end of a hallway asking yourself why this place isn't connected to central power.\"</p>\n<p>\"You will spend up to six nights, custom night might be added in a future update, in said room. You will look at cameras, turn on flashlights and close doors and all that just for a lousy boss that probably doesen't even appreciate your work!\"</p>\n<p>\"Speaking of boss; One of the two themes for VimJam 2 was 'Boss'. The developer put much thought into this of course, although I don't really like this! He says that <strong>the player plays as a nightguard, therefor he must have a boss...</strong> <strong>I on the other hand consider myself the boss of this game!\"</strong></p>\n<p>\"You can interpret this however you want though\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Bootleg Freddy Fazbear 2021</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Hi kids!\"</p>\n<p>\"Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's pizza! I think my good ol' friend Freddy Fazbear has already introduced himself. However he did forget something. Poor guy, has been singing the same songs for twenty years and he's never go a bath...\"</p>\n<p>\"He forgot to thell you that there's actually another theme! Yeah, Vimlark and 8 Bits to infinity really went for it. The other theme is 'On the edge'\"</p>\n<p>\"Boss is more something like a requirement. And let's be honest, I am actually the boss of this group! Anyhow, the developer really went for it here. Rumor has it, he took over two days to actually find a game that could fit the theme and he still isn't entirely sure if it fits.\"</p>\n<p>\"On the edge, the thoug proces probably was something along the lines of; <strong>'Jumpscares are like a really big thing in these games and because you probably don't really like being jumpscared, you'll be on the edge of your seat while playing.'</strong>\"</p>\n<p>\"I think it went something like that, but I can't see inside his head! Just go ask him yourself, do I look like a pigeon to you?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Bootleg Bonnie the bunny 2021</p>\n\n\r\n\"PIZZA!\"\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Bootleg Chica the chicken 2021</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Yarrr kids, ahoi at R.M.S.\u00a0Freddy Fazbear's pizza set sail, mommy grabs a cocktail, daddy answers an e-mail and I might just impale your frail human body right on my hook!\"<br/></p>\n<p>\"I mean...\"</p>\n<p>\"This jam has diversifiers, not few in number, some of wich he chose, our initiator. Yarrr,\u00a0he chose 8 bits, the NES fits the kits of 8 bits.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yarrr, Meticulously he followed the rules, he placed the jewels and used his tools, did he succeed?\u00a0 I hope you acceede. It might not be perfect, but in only one week to tweak the weak code he wrote.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yarrr, now please enjoy the game, in the end there's only one aim, create something beautiful that is not to lame.
