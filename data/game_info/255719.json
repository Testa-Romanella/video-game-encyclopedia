This game is originally in Thai language.<br/>3. There are some Thai voice acting in the game, in which the developer decided to leave it as is.<br/>4. You can support the developer and the artist at <strong>Patreon</strong> if you're interested! However, most of the language is in Thai and we have no obligation to it. <strong>Most</strong> of the contents and rewards for patrons are <strong>NSFW</strong>, and sometimes they might contains <strong>LIB</strong>, which is physically <strong>underage</strong>. So, be cautious about the issues that may be sensitive to you. But, the developer has confirmed that the\u00a0full game will have no nudity.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>-Translator's note-</em></strong> (Actually, it's only Goddiga's note.)</p>\n\n<em>(Whateverzone's main mascot. It has nothing to do with the writer's identity.)<br/></em><br/>\n<p>//It's been a while since our last Thai-to-English translation project! It took a while to get used to the translation work after we haven't done it for so long... Anyways, this game's premise sounds interesting even though the demo doesn't offer much. The arts are also very well-done and attractive!\u00a0</p>\n<p>In any case, I hope all of you might be interested in playing this game and looking forward to the full game! <strong>Thank you!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/954/9549b40748d32436d4d805767f1939fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whateverzone"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
