Once again, you play as Cheesemouth Suckerpop, and are guided through your task by your younger brother Frank. You only need his guidance because this time, the animatronics work differently at night! They're entirely new models, so they shouldn't be dangerous this time around.....</p>\n\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>Press M while your mouse is hovering over the vents or office entrance to light them up.</p>\n<p>Press M while you're on the security cameras to light them up and see where the\u00a0animatronics are.</p>\n<p>Press M if an animatronic is at your desk to ward them off with the Holy Bible. Once a verse appears and stops shaking, press M to activate it and the Bible will let its light shine. If you do this too soon, then it won't work. Be wary that using the Bible often will get you a different ending, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Press Spacebar to turn off the lights in your office.</p>\n<p>Well, have fun with your new job!\u00a0And remember, screaming only agitates the animatronics more!</p><p>Credit to The ReelDeal#7565 for Fangle's jumpscare artwork and death screen artwork, they're very spooky and high quality thanks to him.</p>\n<p>Credit to Skid#1584 for the upcoming OST for the game, their music is really good.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T07:39:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35d/35d94bb0d922c67e83d673797e634912.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["RayFwafwa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
