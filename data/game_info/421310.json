No levels in this game, raise your stats with gold, buy equipment, learn skills and hire mercenaries to get you through the dungeon and prove that tall tales can be so much more. Created for 5th Annual Driftwood Jam, while this is not a full game, as it is meant to be short, it is a proof of concept for ideas I'd like to put into a full length game in the future. Feedback is welcomed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T03:19:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dde/dde17fa4bcdf6e105408612acdf87069.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroExcellent"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
