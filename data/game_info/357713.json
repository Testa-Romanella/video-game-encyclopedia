I did it!</p>\n<p><strong>Why it is called nightmare?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Welp, that is because it was the only word that we liked with my friend that helped me with art for this game. The name was generated at\u00a0https://89o.itch.io/rng</p>\n<p><strong>What is this game about?</strong></p>\n<p>This game is about shooting down tiny martians and big ant-like robots.\u00a0 I would say it is roguelike platformer but it lacks many aspects of that genre so it is closer to platformer only.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Actually, we got some idea on the story of the game but we didn't get enough time and skills to make it come alive in 7 days, so we have only one level. Well, with the introductionary level that would make it TWO!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>W/Up Arrow - Jump</p>\n<p>A/Left Arrow - Move Left</p>\n<p>D/Right Arrow - Move Right</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>\n<p>Assets were made by me and my friend, Ali. We used university's licensed Adobe Illustrator. The only music that we have is created by me in 5 minutes. I am not really good with music so decided to make a short beat-like thingy.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T10:35:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e86/e8621a999f86eee547c52958be8c2eba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tosek_games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
