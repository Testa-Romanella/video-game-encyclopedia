She likes all three Ghostbusters movies but likes the reboot the most, so the game\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfeatures the lady Ghostbusters as well as the classic characters.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimary inspiration is Midway's Tapper but rather than points and high scores, you're just trying to get through\r\n\t\t\t\t\tall the levels. I borrowed sprites from the <em>New Ghostbusters II</em> NES game released by HAL Laboratory circa 1990.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tCredits\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Design &amp; code: Brian Vaughn</li>\n<li>Music: Brian Follick</li>\n<li>Additional art: Brian Vaughn, @BeetleInTheBox</li>\n<li>Original character sprites</li>\n</ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tTry these other games\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Invader Overload</li>\n<li>BuzzKill</li>\n<li>Bustin'</li>\n<li>Bullet Cave</li>\n<li>Mass360</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65ace09b29a98cd52ed99769c446f81e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Morning Toast"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
