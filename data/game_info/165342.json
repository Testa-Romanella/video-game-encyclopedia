Dottles have to be collected quickly, or else they will become your enemy. Enemies will merge together and become even more faster, stronger, and larger as the game progresses, so make sure you put the dottles you collected to good use. Use your collected dottles to upgrade your dottle or to shoot enemy dottles. Plan your movement quickly and carefully, because you only have a single life. If you are hit by an enemy dottle, its game over.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>- 5 difficulty levels, so that the game is never too easy or too hard</p>\n<p>- Local highscores, strive to beat your top highscores</p>\n<p>- Color schemes, choose between light or dark, blue or green color schemes</p>\n<p>- Upgradable stats, moving, collecting, and attacking</p>\n<p>- Infinite upgrades, upgrade untill you die</p>\n<p>- Multi collecting, rewards for being efficient</p>\n<p>- Powerups, teleport, invincibility, double points and many more</p>\n<p>- Events, to make things more difficult<br/></p>\n<p>-Total statistics, see your total stats in the main menu</p>\n<p>-Update checker, the menu automatically checks for game updates</p>\n\n<p>Vote for this game on Steam Greenlight to see this game on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/...</p>\n<p>Thanks for your support!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/161/1612f5b9cf02e6d6612ce5b022b3e8f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jwiggs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
