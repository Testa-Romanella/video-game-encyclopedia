So, I decided to make something where you're trying to prevent a customer from getting angry, hence the time management aspect. The 3 of cups I used as a more literal inspiration to be the three ingredients the player combines to make the patron's drink of choice. (A Manhattan with vermouth, rye whiskey, and bitters).</p>\n\n<p>I spent the majority of time on this one practicing my sprite-making and pixel art, so the game itself is pretty buggy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T07:21:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e3fd004500e816fae65d7a6e4871c27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tomcat-sophie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
