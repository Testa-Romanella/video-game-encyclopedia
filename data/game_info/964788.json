It is the first major release from Harmonix. It was released in November 2001. A sequel, Amplitude, was released in 2003. </p>\n<p>In the game, a player portrays a virtual avatar called a &quot;FreQ&quot;, and travels down an octagonal tunnel, with each wall containing a musical track. These tracks contain sequences of notes. As the player hits buttons corresponding to the note placement on the track, the &quot;sonic energy&quot; from within is released and the music plays. If the player plays two measures of the track without any errors, the track is &quot;captured&quot; and the music plays automatically until the next pre-determined section of the song. All songs featured in the game are edited for ease of play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-11T22:02:07", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Harmonix"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
