If you want brain teasers to improve your IQ while you have fun, you\u2019ve come to the right place.<br/><br/>Chances are that you\u2019ve heard about the ancient river crossing riddles, but do you know them all? You may have heard about the farmer who must take a wolf, a goat, and some cabbage across a river, or a version featuring a fox, a goose, and a bag of beans. Maybe you know the problem of the three missionaries and three cannibals, or the \u201cjealous husbands\u201d variation.<br/>Those are the classic river crossing puzzles. They are popular and well known, and they are all included in this game, along with many more new levels involving chess pieces, a farmer with cows and special levels designed only for geniuses.<br/><br/>River crossing problems date back to at least the ninth century, may be before the chess was invented, with the earliest known examples occurring in the Latin manuscript Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes (\u201cProblems to Sharpen the Young\u201d). <br/><br/>River crossing puzzles and their many variants represent ways of dressing up relatively straightforward mathematical problems. They invite attempts at a solution that range from trial and error to extensive mathematical analysis. <br/><br/>These puzzles are frequently used in job interviews. They are also taught to children in schools along with chess to boost their IQs and improve their critical thinking, mathematical problem-solving, and strategy development.<br/><br/>Your goal in every level is to move all of the characters across the river while observing certain rules and restrictions. Once you have completed a level, you will receive one star for level completion. You can obtain an additional star if you finish the level in the minimum number of moves, and another if you finish the level in a set time that varies from level to level.<br/><br/>Try your best, work as quickly as you can, and keep your number of moves low to earn more stars. Your total number of stars will help you access more advanced levels.<br/><br/>If you like playing chess and solving logic puzzles, then you are all set for new challenges. But unlike chess, you can play this game alone and have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Download the game now and unlock your brain\u2019s abilities!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T00:37:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48a/48a1ae4637d2e29eab6862b83e95a81e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Androyal"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
