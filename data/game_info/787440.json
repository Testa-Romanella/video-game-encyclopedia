I wanted to do that but in 3D and have a very different setting, being more urban while Celeste takes place on a mountain. There are many other mechanics in celeste, like the dash mechanic, which essentially serves as double jump, but I only wanted to draw from the climbing to stay more focused and original. I think my game is founded on very strong core ideas and I knew what I wanted the project to be from very early on and the level design was very solid and complimented my mechanics well. The only setbacks I ran into was how difficult it was to make the game in Unreal Engine 4 as it was my first time using it. I was struggling with the animations and getting the climbing to feel exactly how I wanted. I originally made the clock tower in engine, but it was hard to get it as detailed as I wanted, so I eventually had to remake in Maya which I wasn't originally expecting to do. I'm glad I learned how though, as remaking that with the gears was very rewarding.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T17:10:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/608500a344dd22223069d14f8d1580a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OwenDuffy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
