I stopped trying to debug at the 5 hour mark. I only have 3 drinks that will pop up for you to make. Espresso, Doppio, and Cafe' Crema. I apologize that it will probably bug out after you finish making the first drink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead of making a fun silly game, I decided to make something more like a simulator.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I had the bright idea to take pictures of my own kitchen, and use that as my game art. I thought this would save me time, and I'd have the whole project complete in 2 hours or something.</p>\n<p>I was very wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What I didn't anticipate was needing to edit the photos, and the time that would take.</p>\n<p>For gameplay, I thought programming that would be really fast, but I essentially had to build a mini combination quest/recipe system.</p>\n<p>I don't regret my choices at all here though. It gave me the opportunity to try some things I hadn't tried before.</p>\n<p>After the Jam, I hope to revisit this project to add every coffee 'recipe' from the infographic framed on the wall.</p>\n<p>The Tutorial isn't fully complete, but let me give you an example on how to play.</p>\n<p>If you're prompted to make an 'Espresso', here is how you would do it.</p>\n<ol><li>Grab the espresso beans ( you may need to click twice for some reason)</li><li>Click the beans onto the grinder</li><li>Click the grinder to grind the beans</li><li>Click the Portafilter/Groupo (connected to the espresso machine where the espresso would drip from).</li><li>Click the large image of the Portafilter/Groupo to add the ground beans to it.</li><li>Click under the Portafilter/Groupo on the espress machine to add a cup (I wanted to let you choose which cup to add, and make that another part of the game, but alas, didn't have the time).</li><li>Click the top silver part of the espresso machine to zoom in on the buttons.</li><li>Click the top button once to brew 1oz of espresso (after pressing\u00a0 the button, just wait).</li><li>Hooray! You should score points now!</li></ol>\n<p>I apologize for any bugs that still exist. It seems to be pretty random.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T05:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82f/82f5686ed620aab06642e8f3b6f96afd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mrphilipjoel"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
