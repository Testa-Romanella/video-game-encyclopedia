{"id": 180235, "slug": "atlantis-builder", "name": "Atlantis Builder", "name_original": "Atlantis Builder", "description": "<p>============ <br/>\"You are the last survivor of the sunken atlantis city, you managed to save the most ancient technology of the city, the Atlantis Core. <br/>it used to power the whole city and keep it afloat. <br/>You are stuck on a small island, with only these: the tree of wisdom, one sweet water pool, one chest with tidbits, and the atlantis core. <br/>The core is an awesome solar powered device, but it's only as powerful as the wisdom of it's holder, you will only be able to do some actions every day untill it runs out of charge. <br/> <br/>You will have to rebuild atlantis, while learning why it falled, and facing opposition from dark forces that do not want it rebuilt.\" <br/> <br/>^ That was the initial idea I wrote down when starting this project. The game is a bit different then what is described there, no sweet water, chest or tree of wisdom. <br/>I didn't get around to adding Enemies, or defensive structures as I wanted. <br/> <br/>For now it is a kind of a sandbox game, build whatever you want, and have fun ^^ <br/> <br/>===================== <br/>Crafting &amp; Progress <br/>===================== <br/> <br/>plant sapling to get: Apples, Wood, Leaves <br/>plant corn to get: full Corn <br/>Eat Apple/Corn to get: Organic waste <br/> <br/>Use wood to get: Planks <br/>Use Planks to build structures <br/> <br/>Mix organic waste + Leaves to get: Fertilizer <br/> <br/>Use fertilizer on dirt to turn it to grass. <br/>Use fertilizer on grass to grow: low grass <br/>Low grass grows in time to: tall grass -&gt; Flowers <br/> <br/>Harvest flowers to get: magical dust <br/>Use magical dust + wood to get: wooden Defensive tower <br/> <br/>Wooden wall: <br/>plank, plank, plank <br/>plank, plank, plank <br/>plank, plank, plank <br/> <br/>Wooden door: <br/>plank, plank, plank <br/>plank, Empty, plank <br/>plank, Empty, plank <br/> <br/>Wooden wall with window: <br/>plank, plank, plank <br/>plank, Empty, plank <br/>plank, plank, plank <br/> <br/>Wooden Fence: <br/>plank, Empty, plank <br/>plank, plank, plank <br/>plank, Empty, plank <br/> <br/>Wooden Roof: <br/>plank, plank, plank <br/>plank, Empty, Empty <br/>plank, Empty, Empty <br/> <br/>Wooden Bunny statue: <br/>plank(dark), magic-dust, plank(dark) <br/>plank(light), plank(dark), plank(light) <br/>plank(dark), plank(light), plank(dark) <br/> <br/>============ <br/>Credits <br/>============ <br/> <br/>Music (Sea Puzzle) by: spirulence <br/>Main Font (Popular Cafe NF) by: Nick Curtis [http://www.nicksfonts.com/] <br/>Game ideas and general help: Shake the magical stitch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CyberStarLight"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
