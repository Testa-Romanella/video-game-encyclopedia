{"id": 557412, "slug": "electroplating", "name": "Electroplating", "name_original": "Electroplating", "description": "<p>This is a very prototypical and incomplete game made for the Nokia Game Jam 2021 where you control the electron by switching on and off chargeable plates. You can also change the polarity of the plates so that they either attract or repel the electron.</p>\n<p>We could not get the\u00a0audio to\u00a0 work in\u00a0web environment, but the original game has sounds. Try one of the downloads to play with sounds.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Try to reach the goal without touching the walls :)\u00a0</strong>The game is unfinished, so if you reach the goal, give yourself a pat on the back. You have won the game. Also if the\u00a0electron touches a wall, stick a fork in the power outlet for a more\u00a0immersive gaming experience (don't really).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Switch the plate you are controlling: <strong>Right and Left arrow keys</strong></li><li>Switch off selected plate: <strong>Down arrow key</strong></li><li>Toggle polarity of the selected plate: <strong>Up arrow key (press once for + polarity and twice for - polarity)</strong></li></ul>\n<p>This game was made with Bevy game engine (Rust).\u00a0\u00a0Web version runs using WebAssembly.</p>\n<p>The game is very incomplete at this state but this was a fun project to learn a little bit of Rust and a little bit of game development. Both of us are very beginners to game development.</p>\n<p>Developers: Olli (https://ollipa.itch.io/) and I (https://adarshk7.itch.io/).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:43:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38a8616582ca788bf0060efd713cff2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["adarshk7", "ollipa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
