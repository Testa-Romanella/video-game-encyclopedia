FLASHING COLORS !!!\r\n\t</strong> <br/>\r\n\tIf you are prone to SEIZURES, you might want to give M.O.L.E. a pass.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWelcome to \r\n\t<strong>M.O.L.E.</strong> (<em>Mercenaries Operating Ludicrously Effortlessly</em>), Agent 610! We've been waiting for your arrival.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe situation has spiraled out of control - the \r\n\t<strong>hegemony</strong> of the genus \r\n\t<em>Rattus </em>has reached unbearable levels and their <strong>reign of terror</strong> must come to an end.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt doesn't matter if you are <strong>little, tiny, blind mole</strong>, because we've got you covered with the latest technology which will surely help you take down those lazy and obtuse (but vicious!) over-sized mice.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tProve your mettle in \r\n\t<strong>five, increasingly difficult missions</strong>. <strong>Infiltrate</strong> enemy bases, <strong>rescue hostages</strong> and stop those rats from badgering the world ever again!\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game starts with a black screen. At this point, use the following keys to interact:\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Enter</strong> - Resume saved game\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Spacebar</strong> - Show best time\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Any other key</strong> - Start a new game\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tStarting a mission will commence a brodcast from the HQ, informing you about the mission objective. When you have your radio out, you may request the following information. <strong>All broadcasts are in Morse code</strong>.\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>W or \u2191</strong> - Ask for directions\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>A or \u2190</strong> - Ask current heading\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>D or \u2192</strong> - Ask visibility\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>S or \u2193</strong> - Ask nearby dangers\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Numpad 0 or CTRL key</strong> - Pause/Resume transmission\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Any other key</strong> - Stop transmission\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Shift or Backspace</strong> - Return to battlefield\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOnce on the battlefield, use the following keys to <strong>move around</strong>: \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>W or \u2191</strong> - Go forward \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>A or \u2190</strong> - Turn left (90\u00b0 degrees counter-clockwise) \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>D or \u2192</strong> - Turn right (90\u00b0 degrees clockwise) \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>S or \u2193</strong> - Turn around (180\u00b0 degrees) \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Enter or Spacebar</strong> - Stab \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Shift or Backspace</strong> - Use radio\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe <strong>screen will flash</strong> once if you <strong>bump</strong> into wall.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you are <strong>approaching an enemy</strong>, the screen will start <strong>flashing more and more rapidly as you come closer to them</strong>. You can detect enemies from 5 blocks away, whereas they're able to do so only when you are 3 blocks away from them (1 block = 1 step). <strong>They are</strong>, however, <strong>equipped with a gun</strong>, whilst <strong>you only have a knife</strong>. To successfully <strong>stab </strong>an enemy, you must be one block away from them.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Killing</strong> a foe will <strong>briefly make the screen flash very quickly</strong>. If you happen to <strong>die</strong>, the <strong>sceen will rapidly flash for a few seconds before turning white</strong>. After that, press one of the following keys to perform the indicated action: \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Enter</strong> - Restart level from checkpoint \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Spacebar</strong> - Back to main menu \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Any other key</strong> - Restart level from beginning\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt is possible to <strong>switch between windowed and fullscreen mode</strong> by pressing <strong>F1</strong>. <strong>Resize </strong>the game window by clicking and dragging its borders.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFinally, pressing <strong>Esc</strong> at any time will <strong>close </strong>the game. All progress up to that point will be saved.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNOTE: \r\n\t<strong>This is NOT a casual game</strong>. Please make sure to <strong>thoroughly read the manual</strong> before starting to play, to fully understand the game mechanics and find out the missions objectives. <strong>A pencil, some papers and a stopwatch are also recommended</strong> to keep track of your paths and the messages you will receive.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Good luck!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb20adbfdf69669832821bb3e7cb9346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SimonLuck31"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
