If you guys really like it or more than just a few people play this\u00a0then I will consider adding more content, otherwise I'll be working on my next project which will be a bit more of a serious one.</p>\r\n\r\nRecommended Specs\r\n<p>Potato, literally a 90 MB game</p>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All music tracks in this game were produced by Grahf.
