However, during the creation process, our passion for game-making and storytelling couldn't just end there. So, we decided to found the company \"Heat Wave Games\" on December 1, 2020, so we could not only continue to make more games but do it at an even higher level. Now, we have a competent team of individuals whose combined strengths have the ability to produce amazing new game titles! <br/><br/>As a new indie game company, we hope to grow with the help of the dedicated players within the ever-growing gaming community!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T02:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/046f99625d0afe0ac802101bc68e0e4e.jpg", "website": "https://hwavegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Heat Wave Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Heat Wave Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
