{"id": 49279, "slug": "tempest-citadel", "name": "Tempest Citadel", "name_original": "Tempest Citadel", "description": "<strong>Tempest Citadel</strong> is a strategy game set on a storm-ruled planet in which sci-fi and fantasy collide. Assume the role of an enigmatic Captain from Terra, whose past and future are yours to shape, as he embarks on a mission to explore a deadly world that promises wondrous and terrible power.<br/><br/>But you are not the first to come.<br/><br/>Armies of ruthless enemies hide within the clouds, hungry for the blood of the weak and the foolish. From gene-spliced psychics to cyborg dark-mages, other factions have claimed the ancient sites which hold the technological marvels you seek.<br/><br/>Can you build, grow, and risk enough to stand against your enemies? Will you dare to be as merciless as those who would show you none? Do you have what it takes to fight for control of this world and claim for yourself the secrets of the ancient, dead race on which it once thrived?STORY<br/>Your mission was a lie. Your first moments waking from cryostasis bear this revelation, and you find yourself in a corner of the cosmos that you know nothing about. Only one thing is clear: those that sent you knew full well what they were doing.<br/><br/>Beneath you, a planet sleeps imprisoned by the planet-wide storm ruling its surface. What you're after \u2013 your true mission and your only way home \u2013 hides deep under those rage-fuelled clouds. And the price of ultimate power is always the most dear.GAMEPLAY<br/>Tempest Citadel sees you building a city in the clouds, module by module, and leading 100 unique crew members into action, be they Soldiers, Scavengers, Workers, Researchers, or Medical Experts. You pick their role, their training, their equipment.<br/><br/>The primary goal is to explore the surface. You start by scanning and picking sites to send expeditions to, using any intel you can find to pick the best squad for the terrain, weather, and opposing forces. Preparation is vital; once your squad lands, the battle plays out automatically.<br/><br/>This is what makes Tempest Citadel a Grand Strategy game \u2013 a genre that infuses RTS with high-level, long-term tactical play. Plan your attack, set up your soldiers, and release them onto the battlefield as if it were one long pull of a gun trigger. Then watch the hammer breathe fire and send the silver bullet flying as your squad unleashes havoc.COMBAT<br/>Survival means conquest, so a big focus of research and production is optimising your attack squad and your city defences. With a full array of Sci-Fi weapons, armour, and augmentations, you can make anything from Bio-Enhanced Super Soldiers, to Exosuit-Wearing Assault Troopers, or even Psychic Stormweavers. Ultimately, choosing the right tool for the job is essential to victory; the right squad design can often overcome sheer strength in numbers.<br/><br/>With a large crew to manage, you have options to auto-equip based on a role, such as \"Assault Runner\", \"Skirmisher\", or \"Sniper\". When you resupply with new weapons and armour, your crewmembers choose the best for their role.RISK AND REWARD<br/>Successful missions can yield research data, such as blueprints and schematics, as well as scrap and tech items. Back at the city, these are vital to unlocking the 200+ node research trees, and constructing 170+ modules, items, and weapons.<br/><br/>Missions will also have a cost, both material and human. If your soldiers fall in battle, you can bring them back with all kinds of technology - but they might lose their humanity in the process.ENEMIES<br/>Your progress on the planet is beaten back by 5 enemy factions, each with their own troops, tech specialities, strengths, weaknesses, and storylines. Overcoming them is no easy feat. Further, the day-to-day running of the city is interrupted by tactical and social dilemmas that lead to great risks \u2013 but also to lucrative opportunities.REPLAY<br/>Tempest Citadel is a tough game to master, and there are many different strategies and specialities to explore. Multiple endings and post-game challenges against the hardest enemies also await you after the main campaign. Several achievements unlock permanent bonuses that follow you between reboots of the campaign, and you can also unlock different crews to try a variety of play styles. For example one crew is mostly military trained, while another has a mining and production skillset.<br/><br/>While the main campaign events are fixed, all of the smaller events and surprises are drawn from a random deck and will change the flavour of replays. And the open map design lets you focus on different areas and objectives as you choose. So the story of your citadel forms differently each time you build it.ABOUT THE DEVELOPERAartform Games' previous Steam releases include the empire building economics sim Spice Road and a fun sculpting program Curvy 3D<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>What lost secrets lay hidden beneath the eons-old storms?
