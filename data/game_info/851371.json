Even if that creature existed on this planet way earlier than they were born.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A similar social phenomenon of public ignorance also appeared in modern society when it comes to LGBT+ and diversity topics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Narrative:</strong></p>\n<p>Baby Panda was found on a river bank next to a mountain village of pure color bears. The aunty bear adopted the baby and protected it from discrimination and attack. After Baby Panda grew up, it decided to leave the village, find its own identity or anyone similar, and face challenges from the outside world.</p>\n<p>(Baby Panda and most characters in this game don't have a specific gender, no matter what color their fur is)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future Goals:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>4 chapters, 12 mini-games/puzzles</li><li>Background music and sound effects</li><li>More detailed art and animation</li><li>Post process old film effect</li><li>Better UI/menu</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Assets Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>B Blaco Bear Font - wepfont</p>\n<p>Diamond Dust -\u00a0Herofonts</p>\n\n<p>Yugen - Emotional Ethnic Music by Keys of Moon | https://soundcloud.com/keysofmoon</p>\n<p>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)</p>\n\n<p>After the Rain by Keys of Moon | https://soundcloud.com/keysofmoon</p>\n<p>Creative Commons CC BY 4.0</p>\n\n<p>Awake by Sappheiros | https://soundcloud.com/sappheirosmusic</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T13:14:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b4/2b4d2e0d8add9c8c40c20753d2cf100c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BugOnDesk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
