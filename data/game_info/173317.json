(itch)", "description": "<p>Booper is your typical kid with a twist: Booper is autistic and doesn\u2019t talk. Booper likes to play and have fun; except while out at the park, Booper gets lost and needs to get back home. Help Booper solve puzzles, platform through an expansive, challenging world and explore a vast, colorful landscape straight from a child\u2019s imagination. As the game progresses, the known world subtly morphs into a wild and fantastical microcosm created wholly from the drawings and paintings of the developer\u2019s son. Explore multiple levels of whimsy and fun while collecting the items you\u2019ll need to help Booper get back home.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a752e8fb1e257bd87f494346a97a9a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fletcher Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
