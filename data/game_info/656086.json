The theme was \"Let There Be Chaos\".\r\n</p>\n<p>Pursue your crush through a set of 6 mini-games encompassing classic arcade-y video games and a few wacky scenarios. However, it's not going to be so simple to convince your crush of your many charms. She's only into bad, chaotic kinda guys, which might prove a problem for you. You're going to have to prove yourself!</p>\n<p>The twist of the game is that you are not required to beat the mini-games. Quite the opposite, you have to fail them in order to show your crush the kinda guy you are. Well, are you ready to give it a shot?</p>Controls\r\n<p>WASD - Movement<br/>SPACE - Action Button<br/>F - Toggle Full-screen<br/>ESC - Exit Full-screen<br/>M - Toggle Mute</p>Note\r\n<p>You might experience audio delay and/or distortions if you play the game in browser, if so please either mute the game with M or consider downloading the Windows version of the game where such problems should be non-existent.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can toggle full-screen on and off with F, but it is not advisable to play the game at full-screen, since it wasn't built for it.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>krasi0707 -\u00a0Programming &amp; Game Design<br/>@p_oopy - Art &amp; Game Design <br/>Sound Effects &amp; Music -\u00a0dl-sounds.com, freesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T20:52:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/700/700b5972fc1129ac12da519071b08cb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["krasi0707"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
