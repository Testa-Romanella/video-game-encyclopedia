He tried to hit the snooze button, but little did he know that hackers had hacked his alarm clock's system. So, the moment he hit the snooze button, the alarm clock splattered glue everywhere, and now they were <strong>joined together</strong> by glue. To make matters worse, the alarm clock gave him a message saying that at 7:30 AM, the alarm clock would spray goo everywhere and it would melt him. To his horror, he realized that the alarm clock currently said 7:29 AM, which meant he had 15 seconds to melt the alarm clock with goo.</p>\n<p><strong>Game:</strong></p>\n<p>There are two health meters, one for the player and one for the clock. Your goal is to lower the clock's health meter to 0 and keep the player's above 0, all in 15 seconds. If you run out of time or the player's health reaches 0, you'll melt. Different goo types do different things.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<strong>Input:</strong><strong>Action:</strong><strong>Right arrow key</strong><strong>Move right.</strong><strong>Left arrow key</strong><strong>Move left.</strong><strong>Up arrow key</strong><strong>Jump.</strong><strong>Escape</strong><strong>Go to main menu.</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Restart level.</strong>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Coding, art, sound effects: A.J.</p>\n<p>Music: Shawn.</p>\n<p>The font is Retron 2000 Font and made by Daymarius.</p>\n<p>The color palette is The-perfect-palette-20 and made by Alessio Benvenuto.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:05:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b0/0b0bf0a789c67d0a082357454883d0d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Shawn and A.J."], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
