Don't give up climber!</p>\n<p>In this game you will use your rope to tether yourself to blocks, and use momentum to swing climb up. You can only tether to blocks close enough to you.</p>\n<p>There are 5 biomes, each introducing a new block type and enemy. Each biome has a distinct feel, with it's own music too.</p>\n<p>The player has access to bombs and a boomerang as well. The bomb will clear your path of blocks and enemies, while the boomerang gives you some range to fend off the creatures of the cave.</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the game, then consider following my instagram here\u00a0Nate Whitehead (@1weekgames) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos\u00a0or my youtube channel here\u00a01 Week Games - YouTube</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T14:22:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/401/401e16a7267eca05344bcf181009e32f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NathanWhitehead"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
