As the reverend walks closer to the front door, a little boy in uncomfortably short shorts opens the door and gestures the reverend inside. But when the reverend enters the church however, the boy locks the door shut and lunges at the reverend, clawing at as if he's trying to tear his skin off. The reverend tries to struggle the boy off of him, eventually grabbing a nearby\u00a0incense burner and bashing the boy with it\u00a0against the wall and forcing him to run off. The reverend took\u00a0 a moment to rest himself, trying figure out why a little boy would just attack him out of nowhere. With nowhere else to go but deeper into the cathedral, the reverend tightens his grip on the the incense burner and carry's on to find more answers to his growing list of questions.</p>\n<ul><li>Bash your way through young sinners of the cathedral</li><li>Climb through the unholy spire</li><li>\"Cleanse\" the tainted with your incense (Cleanse = hit)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Art</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Erika Amos</li><li>Joe Largent</li><li>Megan Neckett</li><li>Peter Niell</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Forrest McCarthy</li><li>Ryan Healy</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Aaron \"Ronnie\" Jones</li><li>Randal Murray</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/554/554c3bbfe9df534d2fe7d30647b44508.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["R0nnie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
