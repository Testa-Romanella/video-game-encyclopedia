Losing all your health (3 hearts) will end your run! Controls: Move up and down with \"W\" and \"S\" or the Up and Down arrow keys, and restart with \"R\" when dying.\u00a0 Some issues: Not sure why, but there is a delay in the background music playing on your first run. After it gets going, it should be good though.\u00a0 It works fine in Unity, but built version delays:/ Second issue is the Unity WebGL logo strip on bottom. If you know how to get rid of it, please let me know! Please share and leave feedback to help me improve as a learning game developer, thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:58:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc0aaea7810df5bb13c4a207c350210c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Heisuke Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
