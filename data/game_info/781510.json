Thank you!</p>\n<p>The game was developed from a prototype word game that satirised the way people receive and believe the information.\u00a0As some unexpected\u00a0real-life events popped up, we decided to merge this prototype into a new story.</p>\n<p>Due to the modern internet, people can get information extremely fast in many different ways. Apart from the official channels, it's easier to get information from many personal or media accounts on apps like Tik Tok, Twitter, YouTube, Weibo, etc. On the positive side, this allows people to have more opportunities to have their voices heard, but on the negative side, the online information may not be objective or guided by a certain purpose.\u00a0In fact, it is impossible to achieve an utterly accurate description of a matter.\u00a0The only way to get as close to the truth as possible is to check from different sides and hear different voices, not just follow anyone's idea without thinking.\u00a0To reflect this, we have listed a variety of messages in this section of the Daily Message. Some are independent, and others can be linked to a story.</p>\n<p>Our aim in making this game is to give the player an experience of what has happened or is happening in a city right now. If we could make this game longer, like a month, the feeling would be closer to reality. All the endings, including some of the messages in the Social Media section, have happened in real life. But those are not everything. When we face such a massive social event, knowing part of the facts means not knowing the truth. There is no absolute right or wrong, and we respect all perspectives. So we want to leave all the judgements to the players.</p><p>Please feel free to leave your comments.
