Useful if you get stuck or can't play the game.</p><em>You come round with a hazy memory and a voice crackling down your intercom, \"Alice\u2026 Alice can you hear me\". You recognise the voice\u2026 you just can't remember, who, or where. Panic rises, but the voice is calming, reassuring. You have a mission. You're part of a rescue team. Yes, it all makes sense. <br/><br/>Peering through your left hand you see another world, or time. The past. <br/><br/>Your right hand holds the future.<br/><br/>Looking round, you see a screen, hissing and fractured. \"This must have once opened the door\", you think. Once. In the past. Raising your left hand, a working screen slides into view. You press it in the past. The door murmurs, then pops open in the present.<br/><br/></em><p>Built from scratch for #3DJam<br/>Created by Henry Hoffman<br/>Voiceover by Matthew Wade<br/>Source sound effects and music from Audio Jungle</p>A big thanks to the Leap folk which answered all my technical questions, and everyone else who helped run the jam.
