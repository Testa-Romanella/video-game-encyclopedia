First, the Ho\u0159ice Circuit was created, then the game expanded with AI and other circuits. I worked on the game during my studies at MFF UK. My excellent staff Tom\u00e1\u0161 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Suchomel worked with me. Special thanks to Ji\u0159\u00ed Mayer and Jakub Gemrot. Engine Evolution is an AAA MMO attempt game with a budget of 1 / 10,000 Kingdome Come. I would like to thank all the partners of the game, especially the town of Ho\u0159ice.<br/><br/>Developed by Petr Simunek \u00a9 2020.<br/>Dedicated to Jaroslav K\u0159iv\u00e1nek \u271e 2019.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T07:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e48/e4833e6cf638b1fff3f9a8f8da79f96d.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/EngineEvolutionEU/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Petr \u0160im\u016fnek"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Petr \u0160im\u016fnek"], "esrb_rating": null}
