Each room type has their advantages and disadvantages \u2013 plus with each play through the rooms all shift about and reform, just to keep you on your toes!<br/><br/>To help you on your quest are a range of weapons, magical scrolls and items to unlock. For close combat emergencies you can rely on your dash move for quick escape, or activate your Atomic Fist to punch a hole in the enemy ranks.<br/><br/>Be sure to visit the cat merchant to see what is on offer.
