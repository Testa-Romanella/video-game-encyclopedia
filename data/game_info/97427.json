The aim of the game is to free the prisoners from their cages and allow them to escape through the time vortex. On each level you will find a princess, you must find the key and free the princess. Once the princess has returned to the time vortex the level will end, so make sure you have freed as many prisoners as possible and collected all the coins.<br/><br/>Between their cages and freedom are indestructible enemies. You must use a combination of the pushable crates and timing to clear a path for the escaping prisoners.<br/><br/>Every time you die your score will be reset to zero and each death will be recorded. Try and get a high score and low death count and challenge friends on twitter to beat you.<br/><br/><strong>.: Controls :.</strong><br/><br/><strong>XBOX Controller Support</strong><br/><strong>Left Analog Stick -</strong> Movement<br/><strong>A - </strong>Jump<br/><strong>X -</strong> Open Cages/Chests<br/><strong>Left Trigger - </strong>Roll Left<br/><strong>Right Trigger - </strong>Roll Right<br/><strong>Select Button-</strong> Suicide/Share Score<br/><br/><strong>Keyboard<br/></strong><strong>Arrow Keys -</strong> Movement<br/><strong>Z - </strong>Jump<br/><strong>X - </strong>Attack<br/><strong>A - </strong>Roll Left<br/><strong>D - </strong>Roll Right<br/><strong>Q -</strong> Suicide/Share Score<br/><br/><strong>Follow me on twitter:</strong> @an9rydinosaur</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/813/813149f8d10bc9eb217c04e6b1596cf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AngryDinosaur"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
