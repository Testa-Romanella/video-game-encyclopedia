Instead of squares, the game uses 'balls'. The goal is a slow countdown to the ball falling off. You'll have to move your cube around ambiguous obstacles, including potatoes, chips and it's not always clear which one will be there when you get there.<br/>\nPlayers can select to play either as a team or individually, and have their own unique abilities. The team selection is a bit of a bug in the way the game's controls are laid out.\n\nThe game's not set in stone just yet, though. Outhouse Media has promised that it has some 'starting blocks' that are 'easier to work with'. That means you'll be able to play the game for a while before getting stuck.\n\nIt's currently only available in the UK, but there are plans to expand to other markets in the future.
