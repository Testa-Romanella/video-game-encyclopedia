Will you banish the darkness from the world, or will you become it?</p><ul><li> Combat is movement: Use different attacks as a means of traversal, and uncover the secrets of a world you thought you knew.</li></ul><ul><li> Choose your own path: Imagine a dying world that you explore via an overworld map, picking the levels you want to tackle and in what order.</li></ul><ul><li> Grow in power: Improve and develop Mable's abilities by exploring more areas, but beware you do not linger. As the colour fades your journey becomes ever more perilous.</li></ul><ul><li> Kill bosses to take their form: Choose to attack boss monsters or avoid them altogether. These beasts are the last of their kind and slaying them unlocks new shapes for you to transform into.</li></ul><p>For the demo, you begin with the fairy, spider and stone forms available to you - in the full game, you will begin with just the fairy form.</p><p>The full game will be released in February 2017 on PC, Mac and Linux.
