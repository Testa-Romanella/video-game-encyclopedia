Starworm defenses and that other pesky miner won't make it easy.\u00a0 Harvest, shoot, profit!\r\n<strong>Crossing Galaxies: Starworm Raiders</strong> is a PvP minigame that was meant to be played during Tenerife Lan Party 2018 - a huge event in our island where indie developers can show their work at the Indie Zone. \u00a0You can play alone too, but it's not so fun! <br/></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It's part of a big project: Crossing Galaxies. Something much bigger than our previous games, spawning\u00a0<strong>multiple games</strong> with different<strong> genres </strong>and mechanics,<strong> all set in the same universe</strong>. In this first minigame we wanted to test whether people enjoyed and understood the simplified space flight&amp;fight controls we came up with. <br/></p>\n<p>We'll<strong> start small</strong> and make it grow, hopefully taking safe steps with each iteration. And where do they lead? <br/></p>\n<p><strong>ROADMAP</strong><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>First of all, regular, ideally weekly builds where you can play with the current state of the project. We would love your feedback!</li>\n<li>\u00a0July, 17th -22nd:\u00a0\"Worm Raiders\", beta release. A <strong>local multiplayer</strong> game where two players compete for starworm ooze<strong> in a space arcade </strong>- closer to Starfox than to Elite Dangerous. They have to  harvest as much as possible while avoiding worm defenses and keeping the other player at bay. We'll test the flight and fight mechanic hundreds of times in Tenerife's biggest gaming event:\u00a0<strong>Tenerife Lan Party</strong>. Meet us at Zona Indie!</li><li>Q4 we'll release the polished game in itch.io, although you will be able to play almost weekly builds the whole year.<br/></li></ul>\n<p>^ Yay, we did that! ^<br/></p>\n<p><strong>THEN WHAT<br/></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We might create<strong> a second game </strong>reusing the flight engine before moving on with our space adventure.</li>\n<li>\"Barks from the Deep\" - <strong>Crossing Galaxies' first proper adventure</strong>. A space exploration and rescue mission that will benefit from everything learned in 2018. If life doesn't get in the way.</li><li>Then... who knows.\u00a0There are multiple plans for this project. Space walks?\u00a0Planetoid surface exploration?\u00a0A farming game in space?\u00a0&lt;- we love this one! </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>CONTRIBUTING</strong></p>\n<p>When downloading the game you may decide to do it for free or pay a quantity, whatever you want.<strong> </strong>\u00a0It will all be used towards the development\u00a0of the<strong> Crossing Galaxies</strong> universe.
