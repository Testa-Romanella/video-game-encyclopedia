I'd planned to turn it into something a lot more polished, but I\u00a0ended up way more pressed for time than I'd expected (me not knowing what I'm doing + losing a few days to recovering from vaccine + other life stuff = this). I'm planning to make this a fully-fledged game eventually, but right now all you get is this. I probably wouldn't have uploaded it, but I wanted something to show for my work... also, my friends wanted to see it.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the gameplay of the\u00a0Delicious series and the other GHOS titles, intended to feature my OCs but you can't really tell because there's no text.\u00a0Left click to move your character between stations. Right click to move customers between stations. Give people what they ask for. If there's no order bubble, try moving them to a different station or visiting them again. It's incredibly janky but it's better than nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Vague plans, in order:</p>\n<p>-Figure out why the orders are so bugged out</p>\n<p>-Work on the automove for the chairs\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Add the checkout</p>\n<p>-Counter items</p>\n<p>-Points</p>\n<p>-Combos</p>\n<p>-Music</p>\n<p>-Menu</p>\n<p>-Finish the ui</p>\n<p>-Levels</p>\n<p>-Etc</p>\n<p>-Change the name to something better</p>\n<p>-Animate stuff</p>\n<p>-Make the art better</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T03:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/588/5885693fbc7073c842f42c025af9d92d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheChatotMaestro"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
