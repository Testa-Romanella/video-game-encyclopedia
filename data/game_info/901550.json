Fine tuning of the waves, finishing of the boss fight, and improvement on the sprites soon to come. Hope you check it out!</p>\n\n<p>I want to make a little game it is barely functional shmup rn will hopefully have a full story and probably maybe an endless or timed mode like vs eventually I really do not know. If you would be interested in helping with the project (pixel art, music, ((god I\u00a0really want to put in 8 or 16-bit versions of all of their songs in their levels but idk man)), advice, or assistance with coding)\u00a0or have questions about my plans for it feel free to reach out.
