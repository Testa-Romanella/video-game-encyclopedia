She wants to prove her worth as a Magical Girl, and win the Magic wish that can make her dreams come true, but so far, all she's proven is that she's a failure.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThen, just as it seems that Michiru may have actually done something right for once, and earned Kazuki's respect in the process, a flash of light and an ominous rumbling noise interrupt her rejoicing. Michiru is dumbfounded, while Kazuki merely remarks: \"I never thought it would come so soon...\" Just what could be heading their way?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis visual novel, a spinoff of the popular \"Fruit of Grisaia\" series, follows Michiru's adventures in an anime-like format of 13 episodes. It is split into two Parts: Part 2 continues where Part 1 leaves off, and contains the last 6 episodes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:23:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/118/1188f92b8d945c8d06e4bba615ed37d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.33, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 204, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 18, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frontwing"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Sekai Project"], "esrb_rating": null}
