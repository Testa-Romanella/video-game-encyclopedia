Sounds easy right? Except you play as Justin, a young man with crippling social anxiety. These questions are all easy, \"yes\" or \"no\" answers. The difficult part is that multiple ones get asked at once. You then only have a short amount of time to respond with ONLY ONE  answer. Either all the questions are \"yes\" or  all are \"no\". If you get the majority right, you win them over. If you fail, you messed up your ONE and ONLY chance.</p>\n<p>Network, get past the anxiety, and get Justin that job!\"<br/></p><p>Playlist available at:<br/></p><p>https://soundcloud.com/user-618814344/sets/gmtk-2019-social-networking<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:14:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/807/80760ddc49e1dabf661c7baa358a54f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Silevran"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
