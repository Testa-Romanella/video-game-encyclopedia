The game blends tetris-inspired puzzle gameplay with cafe management and turns the classic formula on it's head. Instead of racing to clear as many lines as possible, you have to fill the orders of those who come into your caf\u00e9 and flashy combos mean less than a happy costumer. You still need to play quickly though, the customers won't wait for their food forever and once you run out of coffee to keep them happy it's all over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>W - Rotate the piece CCW</p>\n<p>A/D - Move the piece left/right</p>\n<p>S - Quickly drop the piece</p>\n<p>Esc - Close the game</p>\n\n<p>Programming - Tim Steiner<br/></p>\n<p>Art - Ben Smock</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T03:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db69907a31e5a39f3d970cfe12fba2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yimmit303"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
