Make sure that they go hungry, become sad, or get sick. To do this, press \ud83c\udd7e\ufe0f/Z/ C/N in order to bring up the menu and to select options. Press \u274e/V/M to go back. If you take good care of your pet, it might grow up to become one of four pets!\r\n</p>\n<p>Game saves automatically and will restore your save when you start the game. If you want to start clean, press \"Enter\" to go into the pause menu and enter \"Wipe Save.\" Doing so will restore everything to their default values and you won't be able to restore them back. Use at your own risk.\r\n</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Spaghetti for helping me with how long it takes for stuff to happen!\r\n</p>\n<p>(If you encounter a bug, please tell me and I should be able to fix it as soon as possible. Also stay tune as future updates will include new pets and maybe new features!)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T04:22:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cd968c7051ad150e9f2d4d2c448b677.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["silicon14"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
