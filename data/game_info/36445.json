You become captain of a spaceship in a living simulation of a distant future galaxy. As a space pilot, you decide how to earn a living. Trade cargo or become a bounty hunter and track down the most wanted criminals in the galaxy, or even become a space pirate yourself. Command your crew, buy new and better ships and equipment. Upgrade, prosper and explore. This is no game, Flatspace is an artificial life to live.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFlatspace draws on many game and science fiction influences including classic space-trading games like Elite, and Roguelike games, such as Nethack; to create an experience as exciting as any dogfight but with a realistic tactical edge to every aspect of the simulation. A large array of options and random elements make every game individual and unique.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis, the first Flatspace game was originally developed in 2004 and is now remastered here for new computers. The game has two sequels; Flatspace II and Flatspace IIk.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T06:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b12e5976393a7c0a2ab2333e89d6a75.jpg", "website": "http://www.lostinflatspace.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cornutopia Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cornutopia Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
