You only start racking up points when your \"survival\" bar is full. After you've fulfilled this requirement you can go back to your cave and win. If your time is up and you don't make it back, it doesn't matter how many points you have; it will be game over.</p><p>The controls are as follows:</p><p>Arrow keys or WASD for moving</p><p>Space for grabbing honey pots</p><p>F for claw attack</p><p>With the claw attack you can catch fish that jump out of the river to get a lot of points or destroy rock walls that stand in your way. Using the claw attack uses up a bit of your stamina, which also corresponds to your points, so don't use it meaninglessly or you'll find yourself with no points and not time to get more.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/193/1937f9b6a8bdbfd04497b7951f6dce32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquareDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
