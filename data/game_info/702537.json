Some parts from this game did not carry over to the later ones, the main one being that instead of a spaceship, the player controlled a handgun that shot actual\u00a0bullets.\u00a0As this was a proof-of-concept, it wasn't ever properly finished, and as such it did not have any intro, power-ups, missiles or\u00a0UI elements such as score and lives. It only contains three waves of 40 Chickens, and a boss battle against a \"large chicken\", after which the game cannot progress.</p>\n<p>Also in 1997, there was an attempted port of this version using Java (Java Development Kit 1.1) instead of C++. However, Java wasn't powerful enough at the time, and it couldn't handle decent animation. As such, only the first wave was ported over.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the 1999 \"DX\" version was made and publicly released, becoming famous and getting downloaded millions of times.\u00a0The series is still going today with the newest installment, Chicken Invaders Universe, still being in early access.</p>\n<p>This remake includes playable versions of both the original C++ version and the Java port. The developer had lost most of the files from these versions, except for the title screen, so the rest of them had to be remade by hand. Some assets were borrowed from InterAction studios' other DOS games, Radar Wars Arcade and BattleTank. Also included is an option\u00a0to enable extra features made for the remake that were not present in original version, such as an intro, score, lives and particle explosions. It was made in Clickteam Fusion 2.5.</p>\n<p>The default controls are left and right arrow keys for movement and Shift for shooting. There is an option for touchscreen controls as well, only on devices without a keyboard.</p>\n<p>Aside from the HTML5 version, there\u00a0is also a standalone Windows version that has extra options for the window resolution and screen ratio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T05:24:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/55747681dd83cadabb752dc25ce90905.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Emerald"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
