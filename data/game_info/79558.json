The mat has four rows of large colored circles on it with a different color in each row: red, yellow, blue and green. A spinner is used to determine where the player has to put their hand or foot. After spinning, the combination is called (for example: \"right hand yellow\") and players must move their matching hand or foot to a circle of the correct color. In a two-player game, no two people can have a hand or foot on the same circle; the rules are different for more players. Due to the scarcity of colored circles, players will often be required to put themselves in unlikely or precarious positions, eventually causing someone to fall. A person is eliminated when they fall or when their elbow or knee touches the mat.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T02:35:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f9/6f9852179e17d5e46539971c22465711.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Georgi Zlatinov"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Georgi Zlatinov"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
