Naturally, they end it through an all-out brawl. Collect memories of the relationship together and store them in your heart, while also fighting off your ex.</p>\n<p>You can only store 5 memories on your character at a time, and the burden of each memory slows your movement and increases your character size. Dashing for a quick burst of speed into your ex will push them back and make them drop a memory.</p>\n<p>Originally built for two players, but also supports a single player version.<br/><br/>Artwork by Simon Li:\u00a0https://dribbble.com/simonlime<br/>Music by Victor Li Wang<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\r\nFor player 1, use WASD to move and F to dash.For player 2, use Arrow keys to move and Right-Shift to dash.\r\n<p><strong>Extra Information</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This was made for the MyFirstGameJam Winter 2018 in roughly 3 days.
