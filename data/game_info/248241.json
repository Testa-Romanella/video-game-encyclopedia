Press Z to start a battle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every item and enemy in that grid will join the battle.</p>\n<p>Once in the battle your objective is to spawn allies in the left side and get them to the right side to destroy the enemy robot. Use the Z key to select and X to cancel/skip your turn.</p>\n<p>Select an allie in the 1st row of the menu and then place it in the highlighted area on the left. That ends your turn.</p>\n<p>After your opponent's turn you can either place another ally or use a special ability.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each character has 3 special abilities that cost energy shown on the left. The number of characters you can have at once on the field is limited by the number of collumns in the abilities table.</p>\n<p>If one of your characters walks over an item on the field it is added to your inventory and can be used without passing your turn.</p>\n<p>After the battle any enemy character left on the field (except the robots) can be added to your party, so don't hit them too hard ;D.</p>\n<p>Each character can die up to three times (hp bar changes from red to purple to blue). After that they're gone. Be careful with your favorites :)</p><p>Items: Fire damages all (including allies), Thunder damages enemy bot leader, apple heals allies and balls give energy of their respective color.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d07ec3c47ed4b367bc27604265a5d401.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BoneVolt"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
