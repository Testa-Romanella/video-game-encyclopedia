Wrestle with the catch, trying to avoid breaking your line or letting it escape. Will you prove yourself to be the King of Anglers?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Controls are Q A O P M. You can also use Kempston Joystick, but this provides a far more challenging experience.</p>\n<p>First, pick from any available lake on the Lake Select screen. As you catch the King Fish in each lake, new areas will open up to you.<br/>Once you start fishing, move left and right to select a casting point, then push fire to cast your line. Wait patiently for a bite...<br/>When the fish is hooked, you must wrestle with it to bring it in - use LEFT and RIGHT to adjust the direction (indicated by the bar at the top of the screen) and UP AND DOWN to adjust the tension (indicated by the bar at the right). Careful not to let the markers go too far or you will lose the fish or break your line.<br/></p>\n\n<p>*Be careful and selective what you focus on - pushing diagonals is not allowed*</p>\n<p>Once you catch your fish, you will return to the title screen, where you can view your statistics, or head out to pick you lake again.</p>\n<p>This is not a game to complete in one sitting. Relax, enjoy the peace and calm...until the fish begin to bite!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS </strong><br/>By Paul Weller (c)2022 Sunteam.<br/>Music created in NextDAW<br/></p>\n<p>www.sunteam.co.uk\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:53:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d13a42fd8e02b9b66df63b649bf9a39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sunteam"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
