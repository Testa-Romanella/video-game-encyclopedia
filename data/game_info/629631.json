Each Crystal adds 30 sec to the Timer.</p>\n<p>Hello There,</p>\n<p>You only have 1 minute on your Timer but you need 20 minutes to win the Game. To add time just kill enemies and explore the map to find Time Crystals that will add to your Timer. Don't let the Timer run out and Don't Die.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the miniBeansJam 7 (\"Night genug Zeit\", or \"Not enough time\") within 48h.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything was done in the Godot Engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sound is a bit laggy after exporting to HTML5. It works fine in Firefox but I haven't tested every Browser. This seems to be a common problem with Godot exporting to HTML5 and I don't have the time to fix it. I'll try to fix it after the voting has ended.</p>\n<p>Viel Spa\u00df!</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Code]</strong>\u00a0j0nez</p>\n<p>Most Assets found on OpenGameArt.org:</p>\n<p><strong>[Sprites &amp; Art]</strong>\u00a0\u00a0ArMM1998,\u00a0Jetrel</p>\n<p><strong>[Sound Effects]</strong>\u00a0Independent.nu,\u00a0artisticdude</p>\n<p><strong>[Music] </strong>Menu:\u00a0 cynicmusic, Game:\u00a0matthewpablo</p><p><strong>[Enemies]\u00a0</strong>0x72.itch.io</p><p><strong>The Rest </strong>from HeartBeast on Youtube</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T13:32:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbc/dbcadd99d039161c92c85f265747a5a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["J0nez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
