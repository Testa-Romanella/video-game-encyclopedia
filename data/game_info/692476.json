However, something might go bump in the night. Try your best to learn how to survive the night and stand your ground for as long as you can!</p>\n<p>How to Survive?<br/><br/>Throughout the game, monsters will spawn at set intervals. Once they spawn, you'll have to flash your phone light on them to make them go away. However, your battery will drain if you use it too much. You can charge it through at any outlet and retrieve it from any outlet as well.<br/><br/>You should also be expecting Trick or Treaters to be coming by and interrupting your survival. You want to be sure to give them candy though, or else their vengeful spirit might summon another monster to haunt your home. If you run out, you can usually find candy scattered about the home whenever a new kid arrives.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Space - To jump (except garage)<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys/ASWD - To move</p>\n<p>Mouse click - To interact with objects<br/></p>\n<p>F button - To use flashlight</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p><p>\n</p><p>Trey Lavender - Programmer<br/>Jasmin Limqueco -\u00a0\u00a0Music<br/>Cooper Whitnah - Modeling and Building<br/>David Soto Zambrana - Sound Design\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T11:05:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/4966ac157c70f3f91d8c44c1b8f6de2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scorch999"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
