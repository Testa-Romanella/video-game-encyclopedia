{"id": 324094, "slug": "parsec-astrosteroids", "name": "Parsec: Astrosteroids", "name_original": "Parsec: Astrosteroids", "description": "INTRODUCTION\r\n<p>In Parsec you pilot a spaceship through a field of asteroids trying to destroy as many as\u00a0possible before they destroy you. You have three different weapons that can be picked up\u00a0around the world, their spawning is random. Health can also be picked up from random spawns\u00a0and sometimes dropped by asteroids.</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\nFLIGHT\r\n<p>Up - W or Up arrow</p><p>Down - S\u00a0or Down arrow</p><p>Left - A or Left Arrow\u00a0</p><p>Right - D or Right arrow</p>\r\nWEAPONS\r\n<p>Aim - Move mouse</p>\n<p>Fire - Left mouse button</p>\r\nOTHER<p>Pause - Escape</p>\r\nWEAPONS\r\nNORMAL LASER\r\n<p>Your starting weapon is the Normal Laser, it has a fairly lackluster firerate\u00a0\u00a0but can destroy any asteroid in four shots or less.\u00a0</p>\r\nMACHINE LASER\r\n<p>The Machine Laser is exactly what the name implies, a machine! It has a very fast firerate and the same damage as the normal laser making it a way more effective weapon.\u00a0</p>\r\nSNIPER LASER\r\n<p>The Sniper Laser has extremely high damage allowing it to destroy any asteroid in a single\u00a0shot. It can even penetrate multiple with a single shot. But beware its very low firerate.</p>\r\nHAZARDS\r\nSMALL ASTEROID\r\n<p>Typically breaking off of a passing comet, small asteroids may not look like much but they\u00a0can pick up incredible speed and quickly destroy any spaceship in their path and push other\u00a0asteroids very far. They deal 25 damage if stationary but are likely to do vastly more at speed.</p>\r\nMEDIUM ASTEROID\r\n<p>Floating peacefully through space at a leisurely pace, medium asteroids are far less volatile\u00a0than small ones. They deal 50 damage, while being more than small asteroids they are far less\u00a0likely to slam into you at a high speed.</p>\r\nLARGE ASTEROID\r\n<p>Sitting almost stationary, large asteroids are extremely dangerous if you bump into them but incredibly easy to hit and hard not to avoid. They deal 75 damage.</p>\r\nDEBRIS\r\n<p>When hit asteroids can break into multiple smaller pieces. While the clutter may be annoying they are largely harmless. They deal 25 damage.</p>\r\nHEALTH\r\n<p>You have 150 health, each 50 is represented by a full blue square in the bottom left of the\u00a0GUI. Each size of asteroid deals varying levels of damage and you can replenish 50 with a\u00a0health pickup, represented by a grey square with +50 on it.</p>\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\nCPU - Core 2 Duo E2200\r\nGPU - Integrated\r\nRAM - 1GB\r\nHDD - ~60MB\r\nOS - Windows 7 32bit\r\n\n<p>As long as your computer is as good or better as the one described you'll be fine. You'd probably be fine with less.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbdbf3d0cea02986b74c6eda4b898256.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PoorlyMadeCornbread"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
