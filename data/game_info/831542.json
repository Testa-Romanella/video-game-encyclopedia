Space is vast, and even stars are tiny compared to the distance between them, so all objects are much larger than to scale.</p><p>Move around\u00a0using WASD, Space, and Shift, and rotate the camera using Q, E, R, and F.\u00a0 Once the parameters for your star map have been set, press V to generate the stars.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T17:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fa54ff76749fddc27ae5bf4081a3bcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["InfantMasupial"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
