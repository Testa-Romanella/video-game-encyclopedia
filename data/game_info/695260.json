There you will meet a magician, a warrior and a blacksmith.</p>\n<p>In the magician, you can buy items that will give the chest. Initially, it is only apples. But with each subsequent purchase of another item, the chance of getting it in the chest increases.</p>\n<p>\u00a0In the warrior, you can replenish the hit points.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Buy traps in the smithy. As soon as you move to the portal, you will get to the level where you need to stop the monsters that go from one portal to another. If you buy traps, then you can place them on the level.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Each time the monster finishes its way to the second portal, you spend a hit point. If you manage to stop the monster you will get the gold. The power of monsters and the amount of gold you get for killing them grows with each level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T07:20:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6beda18dff737f65ec3704f11e0673e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vikingchest"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
