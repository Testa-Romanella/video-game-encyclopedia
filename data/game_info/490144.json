The prompt was to make a game in Unity based around a randomly assigned word. My word was \"Mother\".<br/></p>\n<p>Made in late April, meant to release on mother's day but forgot :')</p>\n\n<p><strong>Copy-pasted notes from my project proposal, if that's interesting:</strong></p>\n<p>\r\nThis game is an escort quest game where you play a \u201cmother\u201d character escorting a \u201cchild\u201d character (NPC) through a series of obstacles, culminating in a boss battle at the end. The main mechanic of the game is that the child starts off at a low level and the mother starts off at a high level, only the child levels up, and only the child will fight the final boss. In earlier fights, you can choose as the mother to send your kid into battle (risking death but high experience) or doing the battle yourself/assisting the child (no experience/little experience). The win condition is beating the boss, the lose condition is the child dying at any point.</p>\n<p>The primary theme I want to convey is a parent both wanting to protect their child and give them life experience to be able to live on their own. The parent has limited time (in the game, only a limited number of battles) to prepare their kid, and their kid needs to fend for themselves at some point in their lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u2019m inexperienced with Unity, so I want to make this game as simple as possible. I imagine the entire game to be purposefully very short and for there to be a lot of trial/error and randomness (so the player will probably fail a lot, but can easily replay). Fights are resolved in one turn by a dice roll plus stat modifiers (similar to a TTRPG) with only two end states (win, lose).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e2/9e2ba75f6a4bd9879905d015e22d5028.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["goblincat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
