Approach the terminals found floating in space and solve their problems in order to gain scrap to level up your starfighters!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0<br/>- Hold down middle mouse and move your mouse in order to move the camera. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.<br/>- Left Click + Drag or use the number keys to select units.<br/>- Right click in Space to move all selected units there.<br/>- Right click on an enemy ship to target them with the selected units.<br/>- Move a unit over a terminal with stars around it to open it up! Then click on its buttons to solve the problems.<br/>- After solving the problems, you gain 1 scrap! Click the upgrade button to make your starfighters more powerful.<br/>- Pressing Escape opens the pause menu.</p>\n<p>Discovered Bugs: (sorry!)<br/>- Once 1 scrap is gained from a terminal, it will never give scrap again.<br/>- Entering into fullscreen mode allows you to see past the left and right of the playable area with the camera.<br/>- The enemy seems unable to control one of its starfighters.</p>\n\n<p>Starfighter art created by Alison\u00a0Weiser.
