Somehow I've ended up with some sort of game... I think that's pretty good. </p><p>The idea is that as you spend more time playing you get slower and slower as you get more tired. To win you must reach the bed before slowing down and falling asleep outside of the bed. It's pretty easy since I focused on the code. You kind of have to when you only have 1 hour to play with. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c5/5c57a710a482d39421c3d41278ff7359.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["crabcrabcam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
