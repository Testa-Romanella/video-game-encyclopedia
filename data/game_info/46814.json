Upon entering a new ship, you will recieve a random amount of additional air, which you will need when you find yourself floating in space after an enemy barrage.<br/> <br/>There's also a bonus Arcade game that you can unlock by clearing 3 sector of all enemies, or finding and destroying the secret Arcade machine that appears in a level after you've cleared it 100%.<br/> <br/>AstroShift has full 360 controller support, Steam Achievements, randomized enemies, a cool soundtrack, and lots of explosions!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/577/57726cac6e52ae5ed6f1b3c6e0d4be72.jpg", "website": "https://www.studiowhiterock.com/astroshift", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["studio WHITEROCK"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WHITEROCK games"], "esrb_rating": null}
