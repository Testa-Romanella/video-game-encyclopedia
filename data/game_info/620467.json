In the game, players control two orbs that can be \"joined together\" into a single orb. This new orb has different properties and can interact with other obstacles in the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>A - D</strong>: Move the left orb left and right</p>\n<p><strong>Left Arrow - Right Arrow</strong>: move the right orb left and right</p>\n\n<p>Mechanics:</p>\n<p><strong>Merging</strong>: Continuously move the two orbs into each other and they will be sucked together. The two orbs still retain their original movement so make sure to continue moving with both, their added velocity is higher together!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>I used two fonts:</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/super-chunk.font</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/roller.font</p>\n<p>I also used DoTween and TextMeshPro in Unity.</p>\n<p>I did all the programming, art, and design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:01:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ae/6ae45a4821a7242f1676bb6379091026.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blast"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
