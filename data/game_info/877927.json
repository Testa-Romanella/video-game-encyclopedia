A Game Boy Advance version was also planned, but never got beyond the earliest developmental stages.</p>\n<p>Intended as the first part of a trilogy, Haven took over three years to develop, and combines action, platforming, puzzle, shoot &#39;em up, racing and space combat elements. Both Midway and Traveller&#39;s Tales championed Haven as a previously unseen type of game, wherein the player could jump seamlessly from genre to genre, with Midway trademarking the term &quot;FreeFormer gameplay&quot; to describe the mixture of gameplay styles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-04T09:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/817/817c1a1abf82189cbeb25dd6a827615c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Traveller's Tales"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Midway Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
