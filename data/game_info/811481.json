After receiving a distressed call from the sister of a recent cold case victim, he rushes back to her home, the site of the tragic death, to uncover the full story as to what happened that fateful night. With nothing but your wits, you'll explore\u00a0 and solve puzzles while evading the unknown dangers that await.</p>\n<p>While the plot does handle some dark themes, the game's horror leans more on its atmosphere and building a strong sense of tension rather than extreme gore or overuse of jumpscares (though they're not completely absent from the game, theyr'e infrequent enough to not outstay their welcome).</p>\n<p>The game is still in development, though the core game is mostly finished and a full playthrough with multiple endings is possible.\u00a0 Feel free to report any bugs or problems in the comments section.\u00a0 This is more of a passion project than anything, and is the first title I've planned on giving a full release,\u00a0so it will remain listed as 'name your price' until the final release.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T11:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68e/68e9098efac00fa9500f8ca92cd712f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magnafiend"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
