The realistic characters and gripping story will excite and thrill game newbies and experienced players alike.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/><br/>One night, Alice Johnson, a young woman who is working for the Solaris Research and Technology Center, wakes up in a rundown bathroom. Strange voices echo through the locked door. <br/><br/>She remembers a company party, but although she did not have too much to drink, she can't remember how she got to that place. One thing is clear: something strange is happening. <br/><br/>How is her boss involved? How the always stressed department clerk? And who the hell is that spooky goth girl teenager? <br/><br/>And then there is one other, far more disturbing thing: Alice is not alone. <br/><br/>Equipped with her mind as her only weapon, Alice needs to overcome all obstacles to win back her freedom. Maybe all of this is a perfidious test, maybe a conspiracy of the government or even the game of a serial killer. <br/><br/>And the closer she gets to solve the mystery, the more disturbing things get.
