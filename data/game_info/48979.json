You landed your sorry little ship in a small hostile arena with no hope of escape. The best you can do is exercise your unquestionably awesome trigger finger to earn yourself a few more minutes ... nay ... seconds of precious life!</strong><br/><br/>Final Storm is a cross-platform twin-stick shooter and bullet hellish game. It's designed as a pickup game you can play in 3-5 minutes when you just wanna shoot a lot of bullets and dodge just as many. Survive as many waves as possible and pickup a few power-ups along the way (.. ahem... you'll need them). Enemies increase in number and difficulty as waves progress. They're worth more points each wave. <br/><br/>When you've slain enough enemies without meeting your end, power-ups will be dropped in the center of the area. But hurry - they disappear after 10 seconds if you don't pick them up.<br/><br/>Let's be honest, you're not looking at this game for depth of story or the latest cutting edge VR experience. You're looking at this because you want to shoot stuff! You want to shoot lots of stuff! Now go forth, have fun, and die with honor.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/17484895b39f663bcdb1d918914e4e9a.jpg", "website": "http://www.bitbionic.com/final-storm/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bit Bionic"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bit Bionic"], "esrb_rating": null}
