If you like games like Advance Wars and Wargroove maybe you'll like where this is going?</p>\n<p>Currently only asynchronous multiplayer works. Singleplayer is on the list.<br/></p>\r\nHow do I play?\r\n<p>First up, create an army with the army editor. The standard points value is 200 so maybe keep it at that?<br/></p>\n<p>Next, register an account. (Bear in mind that between this release and a hypothetical final release I will definitely nuke the database and start over at least once so don't get attached to it.)<br/></p>\n<p>Once you've got an account, jump on multiplayer, create a game and share that code with a friend. (You have a friend right?)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both of you select an army and when you're ready hit start.</p>\r\n\r\nWhat even is this map?\r\n\r\n<p>Art.</p>\n<br/>This is grass. You can move freely on it.<br/><br/><br/>This is wall. Unless you are a ghost, you shouldn't be able to walk through it. (If you work out how to be a ghost let me know because *I* didn't add it)<br/><br/>This is cover. Shooting through it is more likely to miss. Units in cover have a little blue shield in the direction that they are covered from.<br/><br/>\r\n Who did all that beautiful art?\r\n<p>All units are the work of the talented Matt Walkden<br/>The little effects animations are the work of the talented nyk_nck<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T12:44:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35e/35eacdda0887f67d81c011fdacc73179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["rmgr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
