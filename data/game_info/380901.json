You end up surviving a spaceship crash and make it to the abandoned Colony Base. While you are trying to find the answers, you understand that this place is not as friendly as it seems. You are just like a Robinson, trying to survive on a hostile planet lost in outer space. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nHARDCORE\n<br/>\nThis is a rogue-like game. You\u2019ll die. You will die. YOU WILL DIE!!! A million times. Then tutorial ends and you\u2019ll get a chance to fight real Monsters.\n<br/>\nALWAYS NEW\n<br/>\nEvery single level across 3 big locations is procedurally generated, so you will always find a new spot to die! Do you still think you will survive?! \n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut wait! If you are tough enough to storm through a couple of levels, you might make it to an outpost where you can refuel and find hints on what has happened to the colonists.\n<br/>\nNIGHT SHIFT\n<br/>\nYou have somehow managed to survive the day? Don\u2019t worry, this planet has some nightlife to offer! Experience a completely different Night Mode that will make you\u2026 DIE, of course!\n<br/>\nBOT-ASSISTANTS\n<br/>\nIf you are lucky enough, you can find artifacts and create bots to help you! Start with a cute puppy that turns into a furious beast once the monsters are in sight. \n<br/>\nCRAFT AND UPGRADE\n<br/>\nGood news: death is useful! Once you die, the Colony AI will use the DNA that you have farsightedly left on the Base to create an exact copy of yourself. You will also retain all the crystals and artifacts that you've gathered (don't ask us how it happens; colonists may know the answer - ask them, when you find them). Repair the Colony units with artifacts and upgrade the reactor with crystals to energize the base. Every reconditioned unit will improve your stats and increase your chances of surviving another minute.\n<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T03:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b87039809aa078dad929b15f03bdd564.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luxorix Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Alawar Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
