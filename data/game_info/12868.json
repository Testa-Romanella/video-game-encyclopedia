Their last communication only had two words in it: \u201cContainment Protocol\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour task is to infiltrate the facility using a prototype remote control drone and work out what has happened to the facility and more importantly - what has happened to the weapon they were working on.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTHIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis means that it's not the full game, in fact the version that is currently uploaded is about 80% of what was available to play at Rezzed and on my Website. A large section of it has been re-designed.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can play using WSAD or cursor keys to move around or even a JoyPad. Make sure the joypad is attached before you start the game as there is a bug where it won't be recognised if you plug it in after starting the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1e/c1ea338978acd0bf5d804364feeeff34.jpg", "website": "http://xiotex-studios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Xiotex Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Xiotex Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
