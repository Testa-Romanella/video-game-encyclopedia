Fight your way through 3 different levels (and 1 secret level *cough*), each with its own unique boss, and obtain power ups to gain an advantage over the enemies.</p>\n<p>This was my first video game endeavor. I did the coding, music, and (lackluster) art myself. It was pretty challenging. But I learned a lot, all things considered. I hope you get some degree of enjoyment out of this.</p>\n<p>Download the soundtrack here.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move</li><li>X to shoot main weapon</li><li>C to shoot plasma cannon</li></ul>\r\n\r\nSocial Links\r\n<p>Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook |\u00a0YouTube | SoundCloud<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a2/0a28cacf7585cc5c30a4ffe26da99fb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RDz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
