An Arcade FPS in VR,\u00a0Pick up your blasters and shoot those colored cubes.</p>\n<p>Optimised to run on Oculus, HTC vive and Mixed reality devices.</p><p>By making this project i learnt a lot, since i made this game for VR it should be optimised for performance. So i tried number of ways to reduce lag.</p><p>First, For\u00a0increasing the performance, i dint use colliders or rigidbodies in bullet prefab. Instead i used raycast inside each bullet. So each bullet will check if it hits any collider within a small distance from itself using raycast instead of collider to collider check.\u00a0</p><p>Then for instantiating game objects i used Object Polling technique. Since instantiating an gameobject during runtime increases cpu overhead which causes a lag spike. To tackle this problem, I simply spawned the object at the start of the scene and set it to inactive. Whenever i needed an object, i made it ready to use it, move the object to the spawn position and then set it to active. The \"lag spike\" will then just be part of the game loading the scene instead of interrupting gameplay.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T06:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd45bcde5561b0a06c03a4088f84b28c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jayanthvoyager"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
