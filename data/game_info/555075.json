If it doesn't bug out of course.</p>\n<p>Controls (Poorly):</p>\n<p>WASD , Arrow Keys - Move</p>\n<p>Left Mouse - Fling your stick at the enemy</p>\n<p>Right Mouse - Throws a projectile that is trying its best to be useful</p>\n<p>Space Bar - Dash along with your movement</p>\n<p>E - Interact with items</p>\n\n<p>This is not an ironic art piece or an intended meme game. It is a genuine result of horrid mismanagement of time and human resources.
