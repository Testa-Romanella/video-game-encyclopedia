The action is propelled automatically, and only stops when one fails to kill a foe - who, in such cases, does not spare the player - or hits an innocent civilian or colonist. When this happens, energy units are deducted from the Star Ranger&#39;s life-support system, and a short clip is shown in which an old man - played by Ben Zeller, the prospector and stagecoach driver in Mad Dog McCree and Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold, respectively - gives general advice and scolds the player for the mistake made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T21:27:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/672ed267508a5fbfa6cc640634d2502b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["3DO"], "developers": ["American Laser Games"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["American Laser Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
