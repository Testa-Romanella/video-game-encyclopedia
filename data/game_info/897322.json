We have couple gamemodes wich  usually differ by difficulty and few different space objects  (voids/planets with companions).\r\nAlso during the game you could  collect coins that will make you able to unlock different skins and  trail through space delivery boxes!</p>How to play<p>You have to only use your mouse to click!\r\nGame have a  tutorial that will not appear after you complete 7 steps of it. Anyway,  the point is to jump from one planet to another to get score. You also  may get into the void that you have to do opposite thing in - jump out  of that. You will face couple different bonuses that may help you during  your space travel!</p>Contribution and info<p>We do not monetize this game at all yet, since it's not done and  couldn't be released in google play yet, so you are free to just  download and play it.
