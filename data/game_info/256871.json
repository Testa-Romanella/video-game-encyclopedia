You get score for getting the green balls as well as for destroying \"distraction balls\" - the ones with letter on them. Destroy those before they hit you. Red balls are bugs which lowers your score so avoid those.</p>\n<p>Made by:\u00a0me :D</p>\n<p>All sounds and graphics are self made.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Week9: 15.10-20.10.2018\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Constraints:\u00a0 Theme - Game Development</p>\n<p>Core Dynamic: Clicking on balls before they are gone</p>\n<p>Summary: I wanted to make a game where a procedurally generated song is created and you have to click on the balls within the rhythm. Unfortunately on Friday I had only base drums track and l couldn't figure it out so I ended up doing a simple click before its gone game.</p>\n<p>What went bad: I have wasted whole Friday and made the game from 5 am Saturday to the deadline. I need a way to stay motivated and work when there is time and not on the last day - as i usually do.</p>\n<p>What went good: I believe I have created something original - or maybe not but the point is I have created it myself and not reused from something I have seen before. So all in all I am happy about it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0b16706d094b0c0f041767f9557d62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunny Valley Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
