Content Warning for: Smoking, Bad language.</p>\n\r\nFeatures four locations, 6 interactive NPCs to talk to (7 if you count the concierge), grabbable goofy physics (including a basketball minigame!), working inventory and items to collect, functioning interactive screens, and more!\r\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Inspired by Retro-Futuristic Cyberpunk works like MegaRace and Ripper, along with\u00a0 interactive walking simulators like\u00a0Tales from Off-Peak City, this project is part Adventure Game, part walking simulator - and will hopefully on next release, feature some simple\u00a0stealth elements as well. Currently this is just an early version of the game to gauge peoples interest in such a project - so please, feel free to leave me some feedback either here or over on\u00a0social media!</p>\n<p>Supports both Keyboard &amp; Mouse and Gamepad. The game might stammer a little bit when it first loads due to some real-time shader compilation, will get it fixed as soon as I can figure out how to get a definitive list of *all* materials.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun and please let me know what you think!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T14:35:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ab/7ab458b12b467ec87cb50be742ae8b61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkellySoft"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
