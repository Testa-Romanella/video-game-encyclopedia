The first portion is a tutorial on how to manage your farm as the rest introduces her friends and explains how she got her powers.</p>\n<p>Audience was primarily for my younger female teen family members, so there's minimal violence and  no foul language. There is no combat at the moment but may have some in future chapters.</p>\n<p>Things you can do in the game:</p>\n<p>Grow and harvest crops! <br/>Collect dairy - milk cows collect eggs!<br/>Feed animals!<br/>Talk to animals!<br/>Rescue animals!<br/>Play as the animals<br/></p><p>Windows version is Xbox controller compatible!<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to leave civil feedback - thank you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/725bfbb6a6af73aff49f5b4d44620e9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CangoJoe"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
