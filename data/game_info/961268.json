By perfecting your moves, you'll find even faster and more efficient ways to complete levels. Enjoy the rewarding feeling of skillfully flying through the different worlds and climb up the ranks on the leaderboard.<h3>Overcome obstacles and avoid hazards</h3><br/><br/>Sizzling laser barriers, flying buzzsaws and hazardous corridors are littered along your path.

Instant respawns and checkpoints will help you stay motivated and reach your goal.<h3>Collect all Targets</h3> <br/><br/><br/>The universe as we know it is in danger at the hands of the malicious Evil Egg, but, as Craig, you can save it by collecting targets that are scattered throughout each level.
