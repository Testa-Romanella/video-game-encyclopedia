Disputes have reached an impasse, so Earth has cut off all supplies. With no job, and not that much purpose, you wander the space habitat, and try to help people literally put the pieces together through Tangram puzzles. <br/></p>\n<p>Note: this is a game prototype. Treat it like a demo - something that has all the features of a game, but doesn't contain a complete narrative. It should offer 15-30 minutes of gameplay. Try it for something small and a little bit new. Any bugs or spelling mistakes are there to remind you it's just a prototype.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a solo project I made to explore how I could design and implement a game with a narrative that complemented the gameplay of Tangrams.\u00a0 It was made in the first 10 weeks of 2022 in my spare time. All art, writing, designing and coding was done myself.\u00a0 It contains 2,500 words, 7 tangram puzzles, a few pixel illustrations and 2 small story scenarios.<br/><br/>Playing only requires a keyboard and mouse. Game features an adjustable font size to make it suitable for any display setup, and autosaving. All puzzles are skippable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T12:23:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e36d73f0213d3395aac0264c328cb596.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Alexandre"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
