One day he clicks on one popup too many and his PC is taken over by a horrible virus!\u00a0You'll have to help him regain control over his computer so he can get back to his normal routine tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>You'll need to track down the virus on your PC by using an old school console. Navigate through the folders and files of your actual file system until you reach the infected file.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After you've tracked down the file, you'll need to beat the virus living inside the file and regain connection to it. This is done in an action sequence where you'll need to navigate your cursor\u00a0from A to B while being chased by all sorts of viruses.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>\n<p>This game retrieves actual file &amp;\u00a0folder data from your system to enhance the feel of the game.\u00a0Don't worry, nothing is actually being done with any of the files, they're only used to populate the console. But if you're streaming this game live, it may show some things on stream that are sensitive to your privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours\u00a0for the GMTK Game Jam of 2020, with the theme \"Out of Control\". Even though it is feature complete, it has not been fully playtested and as such probably contains some balance issues and bugs.
