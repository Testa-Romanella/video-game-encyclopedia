Haugh)", "description": "<p><strong><em>A many-headed BEAST once led the state of Florida. It conjured an army of demons to help it carry out its wicked endeavors. Its armies would have marched upon the world, but the Godhead took mercy upon humanity.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Florida was cast out from reality, and the BEAST bound in the chains of eternal damnation. The righteous and innocent were saved, and led away from the flooded, ruined hellscape.</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>You were not deemed righteous.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>The army of the BEAST still stalks the towers of the barrier islands that surround this forsaken land. But within those towers lies art and jewels, the only remaining goods of extraordinary value.</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>You venture into these places in search of riches, for you are Florida Man.</strong></em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>A moderately challenging, fairly short roguelike.</li><li>Six floors of 16x16 cell mazes.</li><li>My first game, made under time constraints for a jam, and it shows! It's very unpolished and has no audio right now.</li></ul>\n<p>Dedicated to the victims of the ongoing and emerging genocide against trans people in the United States and around the world.<br/></p>\n<p>It is recommended that you read the included \"readme.txt\" included with the game, which has a better explanation of the controls and goal than the in-game instructions. There are a few known bugs.</p>FAQ<ul><li><strong>Q.</strong> How do I use a weapon?<ul><li><strong>A.</strong> Using a weapon is a three-stage process. First, you must\u00a0<strong>select</strong> the weapon with one of the number keys. Second, you must\u00a0<strong>use</strong> the weapon with the Use button ([Q] or [Z]). A message in the message box will appear saying \"Using item\". Last, you must select a <strong>direction</strong> (WASD or the arrow keys).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Q.</strong> What about shurikens?<br/><ul><li><strong>A.</strong> Those must be <em>tossed</em>, not used. (In future versions, use will probably map to toss for shurikens specifically.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Q.</strong> How do I toss an item?<br/><ul><li><strong>A.</strong> It is largely the same process of using an item, but you use the Toss button ([R] or [C]) instead. A message will appear saying \"Tossing item.\"</li></ul></li><li><strong>Q.</strong> How do I use an elevator or pick up an item off the ground?<br/><ul><li><strong>A.</strong> Use the Interact / Pick Up button ([T] or [V]). This was probably a redundant button in retrospect, and will probably be removed in later versions in favor of just using the Use button without an item selected.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Q.</strong> I can't find the up elevator, but I've fully explored the level!<br/><ul><li><strong>A.</strong> Either you haven't actually fully explored the level, or more likely, you are on the sixth floor (you can confirm this if you have seen the message for May 2023). Go down and return to the surface.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Q.</strong> I keep dying to demons even though my health is like 75%!<br/><ul><li><strong>A.</strong> Health is a percentage which simultaneously determines your chance to hit with a punch (walking into a demon) and your <em>chance to\u00a0survive</em> an attack from a demon. Either punching or surviving an attack reduces your health by 1 to 10%.\u00a0<em>Do not punch demons unless you absolutely have to!</em> Use or toss an item instead.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Q.</strong> I am two spaces away from a demon and only have melee weapons. Help!<br/><ul><li><strong>A.</strong> Consider using the Wait button ([Y] or [B]), and then attacking when the demon gets close.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T19:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8b/e8b3cffb370c6ed4af083b703fcfbd9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dallas J.
