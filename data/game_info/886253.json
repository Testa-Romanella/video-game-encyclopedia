In-game you are a researcher working at a Bioweapons R&amp;D company, focusing on national security. You've been given a subject which you need to study and fill out a report on. Now the subject has escaped its containment and the facility is on lockdown. The only way out is to open the main blast door with a staff keycard but unluckily you lost yours and need to find it. The rogue subject is a dangerous entity so you need to dance a fine line between avoiding it and following its every action to gather intel. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nResearch focuses on the behavioral patterns of the subject. The aim is to figure out the subject's perks and abilities such as sight, hearing, and diet. As you gather intel the subject's main type becomes more evident. There is a total of 20 different subject types. When you are confident about the subject's type, the research is completed. Some perks are more subtle such as genetype, which gives out no visual clues. Instead, you need to take a sample off the subject and run that through various experiments. Some terrifying variations of the subject are also able to turn completely invisible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou have many gadgets at your disposal that are used in the experiments. These include things such as flashlights, dart guns, tablets, and photo cameras. Guard post has a CCTV monitoring station which you can use to locate the subject. Between the main corridors of the facility runs ventilation ducts that are accessible and great for hiding.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"A week ago they brought yet another subject to be analyzed. I believe this one was grown at \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 .  The report we got from them suggests that subject's 4th development stage had an evolution score of 4.6. This means that the behavioral patterns need to be mapped thoroughly before commercial deployment can even be considered.<br/>\r\nIt may never fit that mold, but that big of an evolutionary jump must be investigated.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe subject is now located at \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 , where it is to undergo \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593  \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 . All required documentation on the said operation can be obtained through intel management. As the facility's security system was newly upgraded, the procedures/experiments with an SR of 3 or lower can be conducted by just 1 person on-site<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOperational Management, \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSoteria Security Solutions<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGreat is the Enemy of Perfect\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T02:58:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f69/f696785a11993e4d9dc8d3beb7e68d13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fluffy Cats"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kajak Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
