I think I've learned a lot from it. I did eventually get a lot of burnout from this game so it isn't very finished.\u00a0 There are two levels and a boss level. You can beat the game easily in 2 minutes.\u00a0</p><p>Note: There is a bug where you spawn in the wall, if this happens drive to the top left and you will get out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T20:14:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df30f52af556ba90186165736745a453.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["HugeHugz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
