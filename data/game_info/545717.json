It is about a tank that has to figure out how to make it through a city located in a valley in order to get to an important battle.</p>\n<p>This is my first attempt at Bitsy and a narrative game in general. The game is supposed to be light-hearted and silly, with some humor thrown in.</p><p>Download:\u00a0https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq95gu2e42pg5qo/tank_in_the_city_FINAL.zip?dl=1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T05:55:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/0944d44f2a0b51e7db9b1b33b3ec7b44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fetablue"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
