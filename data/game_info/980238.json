Very simple to start playing but can get really complex and deep.<br/><br/>The maps are procedurally generated and you will never play the same map twice.<br/><br/>The basic logic always stays the same: Rocket beats Soldiers, Soldiers beats Plane and Plane beats Rockets, but you must decide on quick deploy units and attack or wait and accumulate resources before a strong push. There is also lots of upgrades that create another level of complexity as you progress into the campaign.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T08:09:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36a/36acff19122ec5df559f14203f98c662.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team B"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Team B"], "esrb_rating": null}
