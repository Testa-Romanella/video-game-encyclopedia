You have 3 fire modes, normal, spread shot (green pickup), and big shot (white pickup), plus a health pack (red pickup). Only one pick up is spawned at a time with a random interval between spawns between 1 and 30 seconds. The pick ups will de-spawn after 20 seconds if they are not collected. Asteroids are initially created every 3 seconds, but this interval is shortened by 10% every 20 seconds to increase the difficulty as time progresses. <br/><br/></p><p>You receive 2 points for shooting an asteroid, 5 points for shooting a fragment, and 8 points for collecting pick ups. Taking damage will cost 5 health points which can be restored with the health pick up. <br/></p><p>Controls:<br/>WASD + QE to move<br/>Shift to boost<br/>Space to fire<br/>Ctrl + T to restart<br/>Escape to Quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ad/5adda91be04ceeb5bc6bcdeb23e4aa77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zenacious"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
