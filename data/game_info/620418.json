The mouse is put in a parkour where it must try to communicate only by signs with the scientist, who must press buttons to allow the mouse to progress in the level.</p>\n\n<p>The isn't finished, we had lots of issues on the second day.. And we are sad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:48:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9eb/9eb0b5806463017fdad7ad04040d0715.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RookieHoi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
