Try to stay asleep by following the orb, and avoid the obstacles.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMade in a week during Isart digital's gameweek.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe gameweek is a weeklong game jam organized by our school, Isart digital where all the students (artiste, designer, programmer, producers) come together to make great games !\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe put together this small VR game for cardboard. This was our first experience with virtual reality.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe hope you'll enjoy it as we enjoy making it !\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAs per the school rules, we cannot put the app on the play store so you have to allow unknown sources on your device to install the game. You may also want a powerful device to avoid any lag (and lag can be really annoying in vr). Of course, you need a Google cardboard,\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\n\tCredits <p>\n<strong>Artists:</strong></p><p>Morgan Belfort <br/>Violaine Berthoumieu <br/>Marie Adeline </p><p>\n<strong>Producer :</strong></p><p>\r\n\tMathilde Dejouy\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Programmers :</strong></p><p>\r\n\tBaptiste Dersoir\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tJulien Berthou\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tJulien Guillochon\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\u00c9meline Berenguier\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Music: </strong></p><p>\r\n\tAustin R.W.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/4253a4d0d5cddf3a6fcb1f0f6ba20cbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["grifdail"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
