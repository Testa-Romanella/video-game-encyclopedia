The revival of the body was able to resume all the basic functions, except for one - the mind. They were driven by only one thing - hunger.<br />\nThe laboratory was located at a huge station, where there were people who just worked. The virus has spread throughout the lab and the surrounding sectors.<br />\nTo prevent the virus from spreading to other stations and killing people, the infected sectors were disconnected from all others and left in space. But Andrew did not have time to leave the infected areas and was left alone with the virus. After a while, he finds Shelley, the girl has immunity to viruses and she can easily be with our dead.<br />\nAfter conducting research, Andrew found antibodies in Shelley&#39;s blood that prevent the virus from taking over her body. After collecting the necessary supplies and laboratory research, they found a separate capsule in order to escape from this place. When escaping, they are discovered by zombies.<br />\nAndrew tells Shelly to run to the capsule, convincing her that he will be in time. Getting into the pod, Shelly waits for Andrew, but he closes the pod&#39;s airlock and sends her to an uninfected station to help the others. Andrew did not get into the capsule because before he packed up, he was attacked by zombies and the right decision was to stay on the ship, sending Shelly alone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T10:38:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7f/b7ffcaad681e81cc93a885054588af94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.33, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vindiem"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
