However if you would give up on a solvable puzzle you would get a game over.</p>\n<p>The story is about this young gender neutral person who stumbles upon this broken church. Soon after entering they are confronted by a kitsune like creature, dubbed Alyssa from the countless theories surrounding this game, who asks them if they want to play her game.</p>\n<p>There is no sound/music other then the sound of entering doors and the game over screen. You may want to turn down your sound as it is quite loud.</p>\n<p>There are also 3 endings to find!<br/></p>\n<p>Forfeiture is obscure game for the Gameboy. It's been acclaimed as an urban legend in small circles.</p>\n<p>It's thought of as spiritual successor or sister game to the infamous Misfortune.gb, and much like that game it's rumored to be encountered with the same methods. According to first hand accounts, people have stumbled upon it while playing other games, mostly Pokemon. The ways of accessing it very, and accounts describe messing about Pokemon Sliver's Burned Tower and Lavender Town, or using certain gameshark codes and glitches to get it to start.<br/></p>\n<p>None of these methods ever worked for me however. Let me be personal with you for a moment, I've been searching for this game ever since I first heard of it. I spend years searching though games and talking about it on forms, but I never found it.</p>\n<p>Until today.</p>\n<p>Imagine my shock when, a person who shall not be named, emailed me about this game early in the morning. They said that they had the game and wanted to send it to me to do as I wished, the only stipulation being that I tell no one who had sent me it. While I was skeptical about the validity of this email, I agreed anyway.</p>\n<p>They sent me an attachment not too long after I replied. I was wary of the zip file, I scanned that bad boy so many times I lost count, but upon opening it I found an unnamed gb file.</p>\n<p>I popped it in my Gameboy emulator and there it was, Forfeiture in it's full glory on my PC screen.</p>\n<p>If you play this, I must warn you about the rumors surrounding it. Many people who get a game over in this game have disappeared, some of them even died in a house fire. But from my tests of the game, I believe this build of the game is safe. Just...check to see if your oven is off before playing.<br/></p>\n<p>The download I included is the original gb file that works on emulator, it should be able to play on a flash cart but I haven't tested it yet.</p>\n<p>No one knows who made this game as there is no credits anywhere. There any many theories as to how this game came to be, someone got inspired by Creepypastas, cult members made it, a murdered girl haunting her favorite Pokemon game. <br/></p>\n<p>A lot of these theories just sound ridiculous but what do I know?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T07:57:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ad/5ad8b1358a1a78602477d07af94b05f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JadeWizard"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
