This may seem like an oversight because I only have four hours left, but <em>nooooo</em>, this is a <em>strategic </em>and <em>totally intentional </em>decision, to challenge you to figure out the mechanic before you are utterly crushed by the asteroids!</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can replay the same mode once you've played it once through the unlockable play-modes menu. Feel free to beat your scores, unlock all 8 modes, and deafen yourselves with the minigun mode's sound effects!<br/><em>wait, was I supposed to reveal one of the modes just now? Ah, nevermind, they won't notice, I'm sure of it.<br/></em></p>\n<p>Good luck, and have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:08:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf9/bf98178bb1f5927da9306147c70b3b07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J\u0337\u0307\u033ba\u0337\u035d\u0356s\u0337\u033f\u032do\u0336\u0315\u0354n\u0334\u0303\u031e"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
