Using Enterbrain&#39;s clever software engine, I&#39;ve personally cobbled together a game that will hopefully speak universal truths about humankind and the world we inhabit straight to the cockles of your heart.</p>\n<p>If it doesn&#39;t do that, I can at least hope to make you laugh. This game is intended for comedic purposes and should not be played by human beings younger than or equal to 16 years of age. Because of its adult-oriented thematic elements and culture-referencing material, children simply will not appreciate the humor to as great an extent. If you have children and deem it appropriate and relevant to their interests, go for it, but I&#39;m just sayin&#39; it now: You&#39;re a terrible parent.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-20T21:56:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c64e47c3b4eb88f3309ff50e910b57e2.jpg", "website": "https://www.drunkenpaladin.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
