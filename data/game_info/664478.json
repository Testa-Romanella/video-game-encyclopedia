The first three times were civil wars between humans, but the fourth time was a war between humans and an alien - A spore creature from outer space will parasitize and infect insects on the earth, turning them into terrible killing machines.\r\n</p>\n<p>Humans fought hard and finally won the war, but it also destroyed the whole world. Most humans chose to immigrate to other planets, but a small number of humans chose to stay. Those are worthless poor people who have become \"scavengers\". Scavengers travel through the once prosperous urban wasteland, witnessing the end of themselves and this planet on the former home planet.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T05:34:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea1/ea12081c9379f46623d5b6e1aa672ed5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuickSilver Hub"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
