Luckily, time seems to slow down when you have fun - and catching fish is fun, right? Be careful not to lose all your hooks though!</p>\n<p>This game\u00a0was made in 6 weeks\u00a0for the Quickplay 2022 Game Jam. The theme of the jam was \"Tradition.\" Ice fishing is a big tradition in Finland,\u00a0and as Comfie is Finnish, we just had to make a fun little game about it!</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Game Engine: Unity 2021.3.1f1</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Game Design &amp; Programming by\u00a0Namida Sai</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Art, VFX &amp; Audio by\u00a0ComfieDev</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Music by Abstraction</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T13:49:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/230/2304d6b99b8e76e76827eb0ae3034a5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android"], "developers": ["Namida Sai", "ComfieDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
