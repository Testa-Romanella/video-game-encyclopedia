You get points for however many tags you get correct, and how many people vote for your tags, whoever has the most point at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>This can play up to 5 players, and you can blacklist tags and choose what rating the images are. More is explained in-game by clicking on the question mark in the main menu.
