{"id": 152431, "slug": "artifact-dash", "name": "Artifact Dash", "name_original": "Artifact Dash", "description": "<p>This is a 2v2 Pacman style game made for Ludum Dare 37, the 48 hour game jam.</p><p>All players have their own character and they're separated into two teams. The goal is to get five artifacts into the middle room before the opposing team achieves the same goal.</p><p>Colliding with players from the other team will send you back to the middle room unless you wield a sword. You can't wield both an artifact and a sword at the same time. Carrying an artifact slows you down slightly.</p><p>Good luck.</p><p>Note: The game is highly unpolished and it's not even tested once. It's probably not balanced and it even might not be possible to end the game if opposing team players defend the room carefully. Comments are welcome to improve the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e4/7e4f7ca2cdc5096b67e3376ce8c57d8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arhpositive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
