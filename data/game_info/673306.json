It shrinks over time, don't let yourself disappear.</li><li>It's a short game with a linear story and an ending, you don't\u00a0really have to try hard to get to it.</li></ul>\n<p>Time to beat: <strong>1-5 minutes</strong>, depending on whether\u00a0you're speedrunning or going for high score.</p>\r\nWarnings\r\n<ul><li>Not suitable for people with epilepsy - flashing lights, loud sounds</li><li>The sound only works correctly in Chrome-based browsers . You can turn off sounds by clicking the speaker icon in the header of the page tab.</li><li>The game is generally run slower on Firefox than on Chrome and derivatives, I'm not sure why, but it doesn't really affect the gameplay too much.</li></ul>\r\nDev Notes\r\n<p>Aside from the Ludum Dare rules,\u00a0the challenge I set for myself was to make the game from scratch on plain JavaScript, with no frameworks, libraries or assets whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Somehow I managed to pull that off, so the entire game, including the sounds, fit into a single .html file less than 32 kb in size. Source code is available on GitHub.</p>\n<p>The funny part is that I'm not a JS programmer.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T07:19:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12cb627af22982eab5c90160d73cfadc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LNKR"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
