You can build towers by clicking on their icons and then on the map tiles. Building towers will use cosmic quantum currency (CQC). You can also upgrade or sell your existing towers by clicking on them. If your energy source goes to zero, the game will be over.\u00a0 Make sure to play on full screen for the best experience.</p><p>Bugs are expected and your feedback, in order to improve, will\u00a0be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks for playing.\u00a0</p><p>Credits:\u00a0</p><p>Game Designer, Programmer: Arian Saffarizadeh</p><p>Music: Reform\u00a0by Anxious Monkey (Kayson Fakhar)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T13:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b0/8b0311a36d2678a84bf9644e08dda0ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Steel Falcon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
