Place your next card on the board to make pairs, straights, or flushes to clear the level. Gain special cards, some helpful (the sun card), some less helpful (the death card), as you make your way to higher levels. Come up with your own strategy for placing cards, setting up matches, and managing the next deck you're dealt. If you fill up the 7 by 7 board entirely, it's game over.<br/></p>\n<p>Solquence features:</p>\n<p>- An easy to follow tutorial that gets you in the game right away</p>\n<p>- Up to 500 levels of increasing difficulty</p>\n<p>- A high score tracker to show off your personal bests</p>\n<p>-\u00a0And an undo button for when things get tricky!</p>\n<p>*\u00a0Solquence - designed for mobile, now for Windows!
