{"id": 194627, "slug": "double-bubble", "name": "Double Bubble", "name_original": "Double Bubble", "description": "<p>Double Bubble is a game where you play as a bubble collecting smaller bubbles. Collect 250 bubble money to beat the game. Also try to avoid the Dark Enemy Bubble because they are also taking the small bubbles that you want. </p><p>The controls are: mouse click on colored bubbles to move to them, up and down arrows to speed up and slow down, and escape to quit the game. If you get stuck I included the ability to give yourself bubble money by pressing the M key. </p><p>I was originally influenced by trains moving from station to station while picking up passengers, but I eventually stumbled upon the idea of using bubbles because I liked the sounds used for bubbles popping. So my game started to change into a game about bubbles rather than trains. </p><p>I found that playing at 1600x900 resolution worked best for me.</p><p>Credits (Can also be found in game):</p><p>\"Rainbows\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/> Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>\"Lobby Time\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/> Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p><strong>\"Bubbles(8 colors)\" HorrorPen, Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) License </strong><strong>http://opengameart.org/content/bubbles8-colors</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f0a6680ecdc74de6ec8289eda11bf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["bvictore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
