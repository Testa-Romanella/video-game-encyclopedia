Lead your dwarves, help them to reach treasures. Choose their tiers, use magic and upgrade global skills.</p>\n<p>Hi! My name is Andrey. This is my first game. I hope you will like it and we will make this game better together.</p>\n<p><strong>Classic battle mechanics</strong><br/>Fight with hordes of enemies in the spirit of old computer strategies and favorite flash defense games.</p>\n<p><strong>Active Background</strong><br/>Each location has its own mechanic. Brave amazons hide in the forest, the leader of the wolf pack is seated on the rocky ledge. Use all possible resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible upgrade warriors in battle</strong><br/>Pump your dwarves as you like. Adjust to the incoming wave of enemies. Do you want dwarf thief? Do you want a master of swords with crit hits? Or maybe a golem summoner? No problem!</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Guilds</strong><br/>In guilds, you can receive special assignments with new mechanics. Do you want to lead the orcs? Or become a magister of magic? Well, or to rob caravans?</p>\n\n<p><strong>System of global skills</strong><br/>In addition to dwarf upgrades in the locations, you have various permanent skills.<br/>To open them you will have to prove worthy in battles. And for the most interesting will have to sweat in guilds. Calling meteor showers or being a berserker is not easy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A new approach to battles.</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike similar games, where the whole battle is focused at one point of the screen, I introduced a system to block the movement of the soldiers. A dwarf with a goblin is fighting 1 to 1. A dwarf with a huge 5 to 1. If the dwarves or enemies are too many, they go ahead to defeat the base sooner.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible complexity system</strong><br/>Think tactics, calculate every action or relax and pile on the enemy, choose only you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/202/2027b43701732891c9dff5098bea22d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Defentures"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
