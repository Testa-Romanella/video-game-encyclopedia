I really struggle writing descriptions and \"about\" sections for things. Everything winds up feeling really artificial and kind of robotic? Anyway, so Homebound is a very tiny prototype for a larger interactive fiction game that I'd like to make. I wanted to release this so that I can find out if it makes sense to anyone and if they find it a little interesting. <br/></p>\n<p>While I am very proud of Homebound, I would not expect anyone to actually pay money for it as a retail product, so please do not feel compelled in anyway shape or form to pay any amount of money for the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you do wish to contribute, I will utilize any donations to continue making more games and trying to make new things that people would be interested in.\u00a0</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Homebound is about finding comfort when you're alone. You play as Jam, who in January of 2020 moved to New City Center from his home town of Wolfwater, TK to live closer to friends. Take a peek into a night of restless sleep for Jam and learn to let yourself find comfort on your hardest days.<br/></p>\r\nKey Features\r\n<ul><li>Explore Jam's apartment and find bits of dialogue!\u00a0</li><li>Real \"Point and Click\" action!</li><li>Twice the endings! Double the value!\u00a0</li><li>A wholesome story about anxiety and worry.</li><li>There is NOT a fishing minigame, but if people like this one, I was going to make one that was about fishing next. I'm going to do it anyway. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54b/54b77bd4c45c935165e746068629b03b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JazzPaw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
