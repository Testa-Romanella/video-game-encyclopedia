As a job, we make large-scale games in a large team, but we are lately interested in making a small game in a small team so we got together in a holiday and made this game for Ludum Dare. We hope you will enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T11:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4f/e4f7c6ab1cbd5c8e7380b2a1df45a3f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web", "PC"], "developers": ["ayama"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
