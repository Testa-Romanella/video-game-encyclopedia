Risk the same fate if you get too close to a wall. It\u2019s a very incomplete experience, but offers some exploration.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was less of a gameplay success and more of a technical achievement. Virtually everything that moves is guided by the interconnected passageways, including the player ship, enemy targets, and seeking missiles.</p>\n<p><strong>5TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION</strong></p>\n<p>While I've made an effort to keep the flaws and feel\u00a0of the original prototypes, I've\u00a0attempted to smooth things over just a bit:</p>\n<ul><li>access both prototypes from a newly created selection screen</li><li>title screen was enhanced slightly with the addition of a subtle \u201c3D\u201d</li><li>some help info was added to the screen for convenience while playing</li><li>created a respawn (self-destruct) feature as a quality of life improvement</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T02:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/027/02753a331b2e27178887f29517456a25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cosmic Misfit Drew"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
