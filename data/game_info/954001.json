Humanity retreated to a planet called Typhon as a way to escape the Alien's wrath. The Aliens, after the invasion, unknowingly dropped parasites of unknown origin onto Earth, causing the parasite to begin reproducing and expanding. The human government began to study the parasite and its behavior by creating a dedicated research facility named the \"Pandora's Box.\"  After a few years of the research facility's creation, the facility had gotten overrun by the infection and was abandoned. The military formed a special military branch called the Cleaner Containment Regiment.
