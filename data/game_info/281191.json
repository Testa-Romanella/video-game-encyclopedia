Triggered by buttons on his back, the environment changes to reflect the emotional state.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0The main character - the Master, rises as the experience starts into another plane. The viewer observes different choreographed performances based on three different emotions, Happiness, Anger and Fear. With each shift of emotion, the environment is transformed and the personified emotions dramatically change in appearance. However, Fear is always present, constantly watching throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p>For more insight\u00a0behind the scenes:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Follow us on Social:<br/>Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/sawmillstudi...<br/>Twitter - https://twitter.com/sawmill_studios<br/>Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/sawmill_stu...<br/>Linkedin - https://www.linkedin.com/company/sawm...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d34/d340feeb1bc93004fc2d11499e017646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thesawmill"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
