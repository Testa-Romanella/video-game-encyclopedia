I always loved it's peaceful, simplistic nature and considering you have to jump through hoops to play a flash game, I thought why not recreate it</p>\n<p>I added some challenge and variance as you progress. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Maybe the best part\u00a0of the original was the music. I lack the talent and time to come up with something so great, but found a great track by Scott Holmes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T04:15:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d3/8d342b5977f9743b6227cfe304ffa4bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chobinhood"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
