Responsive controls and crisp, bright low-poly/pixel art visuals at a smooth framerate, with the sole exception of the final boss, which goes all in on the bullet hell elements teased in prior levels.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cReally solid, clean, and fun arcade-action title with a lot of charm\u2026 one of my favorite action games I've played this year. \u201d<br/><br/>\u201c\u2026I can certainly see how this would be a speedrunner's delight.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cFast Paced Old School Fun at a Great Price\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c\u2018Mega Man meets Crash Bandicoot\u2019. Hidden gem is right. This is a fun behind the back shooter platformer that takes you down corridors of baddies. The bad guys are mixed and matched to make each scenario unique and increasingly challenging.\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T01:30:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d9/5d98dd99fcdfcd0fa005b1125f638036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Renegade Sector Games", "Tales of the Renegade Sector"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Renegade Sector Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
