Explore hostile solar systems, construct outposts, and craft precious materials to keep your crew alive. During the long hibernation between suns, expand the knowledge and ability of your exiles, and delay the arrival of The Gloom. <br/><br/>The Banished Vault is a run-based strategy game of solar system exploration, resource and crew management, and outpost construction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Procedurally generated solar systems are displayed as realistic energy maps, with various bodies presenting different challenges. Plan your movements carefully, as engines and fuel behave according to a simplified but punishing rocket equation. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Construct outposts in orbit and on planet surfaces, considering the space needed, hazards, and accessibility. Resources are not tracked globally, and must be harvested and transported by your star ships from various locations to be used. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Search for artifacts to bring back to the Vault to unlock abilities for your exiles and new buildings to construct. Dice challenges test your exiles\u2019 faith enduring hazards in a hostile universe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Complete your run by surviving long enough to write the story of your Vault and transmit it home. The voyage is challenging - your exiles might die or be left behind. If you are reduced to one exile, the journey fails. No one can survive alone.<h3>FEATURES</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>Unique gameplay and solar system presentation</strong> using simplified but realistic math.<br/></li><li><strong>Challenging and permanent decisions</strong> reward planning and careful play. <br/></li><li><strong>Tense risk management and exploration</strong> involving dice challenges and unforeseen outcomes.<br/></li><li><strong>Gorgeous hand-drawn art </strong>and board game style aesthetic.<br/></li><li><strong>A stark and hostile original setting</strong> inspired by Alien and The Book of the New Sun.<br/></li><li><strong>An extensive and carefully written manual</strong> that combines tutorial, game explanation, and reference guide.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-28T03:55:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2da981e5f2fd0c463c6fdaf0f0545c.jpg", "website": "https://www.bithellgames.com/the-banished-vault", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Lunar Division"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bithell Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
