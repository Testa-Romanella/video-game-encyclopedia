It includes games, activities, and a picture glossary.<br/><br/>Our aim is to preserve and promote as many Tlingit words as possible through an engaging, visual game-based learning process. The tool is designed to supplement language-speaking apps. The game targets language learners of all ages, with a special focus on individuals who benefit from visual references and aids.<br/><br/><strong>Game Overview</strong><br/>The game is divided into two core sections, accessible from the same HUD. They are SHOWROOMS and GAMES. <br/><br/><strong>Showroom Navigation by Theme</strong><br/>Around the World:<br/>People, places, Alaska map, wind directions, weather, etc.<br/><br/>The Human Body:<br/>Human body parts, systems, conditions, food, etc.<br/><br/>Verbs:<br/>Verbs transcribed from Keri Eggleston\u2019s Verb Database and Tling\u00edt thematic lexicon.<br/><br/>Around the House + Tools:<br/>Household items, tools, cooking utensils.<br/><br/>Water and Animals:<br/>Water references, animals, birds, insects, etc.<br/><br/>Say it in Tlingit Phrases:<br/>A visual interpretation of various Tlingit phrases seen in phrase books such as \"Say It in Tlingit: A Tlingit Phrase Book\"<br/><br/><strong>Games</strong><br/><br/>Trivia Game:<br/>Tling\u00edt thematic lexicon categorized into 20 different categories.<br/><br/>Concept Matching Game:<br/>A visual game involving word-image matching.<br/><br/>Memory Matching Game:<br/>A classic memory game with matching pairs.<br/><br/>Simulated Conversations:<br/>Example conversations with up to 8 bots currently, each containing straightforward simple dialogue taken from the Say it in Tlingit book from SHI. <br/><br/>Sliding puzzle<br/>These are sliding puzzles where each puzzle features one Tlingit word. I believe there are 30 different puzzles currently for this one, but can be infinitely expanded upon.<br/><br/>Word Find<br/>There are 30 different word find puzzles where viewers are given the English translation and they have to find the word in Ling\u00edt.<br/><br/><strong>Additional Feataures</strong><br/><br/>Picture Glossary:<br/>Accessible from the main menu or within the showroom HUD.<br/><br/>Note taking feature:<br/>The pencil icon in the showroom will allow you to take notes are you are navigating the showrooms. You can save these notes and favorite them as well. Press new note to get started with this one. <br/><br/>Notes will be saved to game folder as follows:<br/>Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Let's Learn Ling\u00edt\\Documents<br/><br/>Photo Mode:<br/>If you click the person icon in the showroom it will put you in first person mode. Clicking your P key will then put you into photo mode. So if someone wanted to teach a few Tlingit words in their class, they can just snap a couple screenshots and that way they don\u2019t have to source all the visual references themselves.<br/><br/>Photos will be saved to game folder as follows:<br/>Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Let's Learn Ling\u00edt\\LetsLearnLingitHD\\Screenshots<br/><br/>Quick Search:<br/>Quick search has been added as a faster means of searching for words<br/><br/><strong>Note from the Developer:</strong><br/><br/>My Tlingit name is Da Ka Xeen.
