Only one man can stop them and save the world. Of course he starts in America.\u00a0<br/><br/>-------\u00a0<br/>Game is pretty short, just one procedurally generated level for you to beat. There is score counter, later I might code some highscore table for it, for now I will be glad for some High Scores in comments :)\u00a0<br/><br/>Thanks to the theme game should be pretty easy to learn, as it has only 2 buttons for control :)\u00a0<br/><br/>I developed the game alone during all three days. In last few hours AwesomeA and Guby came to help me finding sounds and improve my placeholder graphics, and I really appreciate it.\u00a0<br/><br/>Hope you all enjoy it :)<br/></p>\n\n<p>http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&amp;uid=56123</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d3/2d3334ba081dc910f00c094989a69775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["wryxo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
