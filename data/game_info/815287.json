To travel to another screen, just walk to an exit and touch the edge of the screen.</p>\r\nRADAR\r\n<p>A\u00a0display of the map is at the top right of the screen. The white square is your current point. The golden point is the door you begin from.</p>\r\nSTAR BITS\r\n<p>They are scattered across the different quadrants of the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will need to collect 4 of them, before the door to the Great Dragon opens.</p>\r\nENEMIES\r\n<p>Enemies walk around the map, and touching them will hurt you.</p>\n<p>You start the adventure with 3 hearts. Losing all hearts is a game over.</p>\n<p>CTRL + R will reset the cart to let you try again.</p>\r\nPOTIONS\r\n<p>You start out with 5 potions.</p>\n<p>Pressing Z during gameplay will use a potion and refill you to 3 hearts. There are no ways to refill potions, so use them wisely.</p>\r\nATTACKING\r\n<p>To use your sword, move your character toward the enemy and press X. Enemies will disappear if they recieve enough damage. Most of them only have one HP.</p>\n<p>The sword will thrust forward in the direction of your last movement.</p>\n<p>You stand still for a moment after you use your sword.</p>\r\nDIALOGUE SCREEN\r\n<p>After collecting items or at certain points of the adventure, your follower, Drin, will say something to you.</p>\n<p>Simply press Z\u00a0when you want to advance to the next bit of dialogue.</p>\n<p>Gameplay will resume once every line of dialogue has been displayed.</p>\r\nDRIN, PRINCE OF THE UNDERWORLD\r\n<p>He is here to help you...</p>\r\nBehind The Scenes\r\n<p>I am SO PROUD of this one!</p>\n<p>I definitely had a lot of Zelda 1 in mind as I worked on it... and I absolutely love the final result. Nothing beats how I can explore more than one screen with a simple changing of tiles!</p>\n<p>Plus i think Drin is incredibly cute. Just saying.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game made in Pico8\r\n</p>\n<p>Design and Programming by KaaSnake\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by KaaSnake\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T05:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/3639baf9d7a8730e67f05541f3e2ba65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KaaSnake"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
