Pickup all the golds bags before being caught by levels guards, and find the door. Use bombs to stop ennemies, to pass though bricks. Don't be caught droid, avoid spikes.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:35:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/319/3190f9c0a352dfc709aae8b204b72a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brizzlyy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
