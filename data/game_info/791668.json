You level those up to fight monsters and earn skill points. <br/>\u25c9 You quickly unlock <strong>Mining</strong>, <strong>Fishing</strong>, and <strong>Smithing</strong> using skill points. You level up mining and fishing to get resources used in smithing to craft upgrades, which help you fight monsters to reach world 2.<br/>\u25c9 Once you reach world 2, you can partially reset your progress and rerun the whole game much faster and progress further. Reach world 3, and you unlock the farming skills of <strong>Tilling</strong>, <strong>Botany</strong>, and <strong>Apothecary</strong>. Level up your tilling by harvesting crops, and botany by planting a series of increasingly exotic flowers, then use them to brew strong potions to buff up and fight monsters even better to reach world 4. <br/>\u25c9 You keep doing this forever, unlocking the other 14 skills and gameplay mechanics (pet breeding, tunnels and construction, crusades, etc) and fighting increasingly difficult mobs over 10 worlds, from the Grasslands all the way to the Maelstrom!!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-07T20:05:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5f689a657f0294e31498753a20fcac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 213, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 351, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lavaflame2"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lavaflame2"], "esrb_rating": null}
