Enjoy!</p><p>Dikdik is seeking buried treasure, but her eyesight isn't so good...maybe you can help her out? Take a leisurely stroll in free mode or try to get a high score in Timed Mode!<br/></p><p>Made in 48 hours for the Teacart 1k, Dikdik: A-Grazing Treasure Hunter makes use of your SHARECART1000-compatible save data!</p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/><ul><li>WASD/Arrow Keys to move</li><li>Spacebar to graze</li><li>ESC to pause (in Free Mode only)</li></ul>How to play:<ul><li>Guide Dikdik around the field and seek out odd-looking tiles. Graze on the tiles to uncover buried treasure!</li><li>In Timed Mode, you have one minute to get as many points as you can through treasure pickups. Bonus points are awarded for being quick and thorough.</li><li>In Free Mode, you can uncover buried treasure at your leisure, but no points are awarded.</li><li>Treasure variety and background music will change based on your SHARECART1000 save, so be sure to play more than once!</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Pausing is disabled in Timed Mode, partially because of a bug, but also so you can't cheat by pausing to get a better look at the screen!</li><li>There is no \"proper\" way to exit the game; you must use the \"X\" button on the window.</li></ul><p><strong>SHARECART1000 users: </strong>DAGTH reads your o_o.ini file upon starting a run and each time you load a new screen. It writes back to your file only when you exit a screen, finish a \"Timed Run\", or pause during \"Free Play\".<br/></p><p>I used Scirra Construct 2 to make this game, so I had to build my own SHARECART1000 support from scratch. It may not be the most efficient, but it seems to work pretty well. If you're also a Construct 2 user, you can download the framework I put together in a capx file and create your own SHARECART1000 compatible games.</p><p><strong>Mac and Linux users:</strong> I haven't tested the Mac and Linux builds personally, so it may be wise to make a backup of your o_o.ini if you want to try them out. I don't anticipate any issues, but better safe than sorry, right?<br/></p>Credits:<p>Programming by Eric Neuhaus (@donkeyspaceman)<br/>Art by Colin Greenhalgh (@CuddlyColin)<br/>Music by Reid Turner (@ReidRTurner)</p><p>Created with Scirra Construct 2<br/>Sound effects made with Bfxr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fb/9fb551f75af756726cfbe42cd3390e88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Virtually Competent"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
