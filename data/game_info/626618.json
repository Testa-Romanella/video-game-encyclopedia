The game is also built around a story unlike most shmups, telling a different tale with each of it's main characters (3 of which are not in this demo)</p>\n<p> This demo represents what a single level could play like out of 1 of the 4 characters planned for the game, as the game is still early in production from a complete overhaul of the project's scope. We put as much content as we could fit in this demo before starting with the rest of the game to see what works and what doesn't, so feedback is HEAVILY appreciated.<br/></p>\r\nWhat's in the demo?\r\n<p>This demo features 8 emblems to unlock with varying levels of challenge, meant to be replayed over and over again just like it's arcade inspired roots!</p>\n<ul><li>1 playable character (Rood)  \r\n</li><li>1 playable level (Newtropic City)  \r\n</li><li>4 powers to utilize (Fireball, Tracer, Pulse, and Mini)  \r\n</li><li>8 unlockable pieces of media detailing the game's development  \r\n</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys </strong>- Move<br/> <strong>Z </strong>- Fire<br/> <strong>X </strong>- Item<br/> <strong>C </strong>- Swap<br/> <strong>Enter -</strong> Pause</p>\n<p> <strong>Stay in touch with us at:</strong><br/> The Team Moonbracket Twitter account: https://twitter.com/teammoonbracket<br/> And the official Let's Fly Away Discord server: https://discord.gg/pvqkw2f<br/> Check out the demo's soundtrack as well: Let's Fly Away - Demo OST<br/> And with above all else, we hope you download and enjoy the demo, we've had tons of fun, and learned a lot working on this for the three years we did.<br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p> This game has been brought to you by the various team members and friends of Team Moonbracket, which include...</p>\n<p> DIRECTOR<br/> <strong>Tiniest Turtles</strong> | @TiniestTurtles<br/><br/> CO-DIRECTORS<br/> <strong>D.Conn</strong> | @dconn537<br/> <strong>Off<br/></strong><br/> LEAD PROGRAMMER<br/> <strong>Tiniest Turtles<br/></strong><br/> PROGRAMMING<br/> <strong>D.Conn<br/> firubii</strong> | @firubii<br/> <strong>Sharb</strong> | @Renhoex<br/><br/> LEAD COMPOSER<br/> <strong>D.Conn<br/></strong><br/> SOUND DESIGN<br/> <strong>D.Conn<br/></strong><br/> LEAD ARTISTS<br/> <strong>Off<br/> K\u00edbito\u00c1yame </strong>| @KibitoAyame<br/> ARTISTS<br/> <strong>Apocalypsehigh<br/> DusterBuster </strong>| @SirDusterBuster<br/> <strong>Topaz Pikmin<br/> Xenoglitch </strong>| @Xenoglitch<br/> <strong>spikeman750 </strong>| @spikeman750<br/> <strong>Gulumpy </strong>| @GulorpleGump<br/> <strong>TheChaseExperience </strong>| @TheChaseExp<br/><br/> LEAD WRITER<br/> <strong>Starbitz </strong>| @Starbitz_<br/><br/> WRITING ASSISTANCE<br/> <strong>D.Conn<br/> Off<br/></strong><br/> WRITING LOCALIZATION<br/> <strong>VirtuaPlastic </strong>| @ThePlasticGuy_<br/><br/> ROOD VOICE ACTOR<br/> <strong>Mai</strong><br/><br/> ORIGINAL CROOD CREATOR<br/> <strong>Meli Satana </strong>| @MeliSatana<br/><br/> PLAYTESTERS<br/> <strong>D00D64 </strong>| @d00d64<br/> <strong>Gulumpy </strong>| @GulorpleGump<br/> <strong>SKingBlue </strong>| @SKingBlue<br/> <strong>SoupBowler64 </strong>| @soupmedia2014<br/> <strong>TheChaseExperience </strong>| @TheChaseExp<br/> <strong>war-dog </strong>| @wardoglasthero</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T08:03:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9f/c9fd68e0431d3e7eb65559dce7e8abcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Moonbracket"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
