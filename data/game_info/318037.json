You must use that to escape.</p>\n<p>There are currently 9 playable levels, but there will be a lot more as development continues. What's here mostly acts as a prototype of the idea, developed in my free time over a few months. There's still a lot of honing to do, as well as adding additional puzzle mechanics to make the game more interesting.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy what you find! If you have any comments or constructive feedback, I'd be happy to hear it. I will be taking feedback seriously, especially bug fixes, though I do not have a strict timeline for updates at the moment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a7dcebdad427143859739c09078a93f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enzar17"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
