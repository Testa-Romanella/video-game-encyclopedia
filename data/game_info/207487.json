I wanted my run through to be fun and go along with my small &amp; lovely blue dragon. I created a C# script to make the music begin when the colored panels hit the floor. The ball pushes these rainbow panels to the first blue bar. I used hinge joints for the blue bar and the dragon. The egg-like ball continues on the bounce its way to the dragon, which then pushes another egg-like ball down the path to the ball brawl exit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13c/13cd67286dd565adc8cb52311799aab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bexthehexx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
