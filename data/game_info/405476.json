In the nick of time, Junko has appeared on the scene and said that she could make a new Hourai Elixir with\u00a0a special mochi.\u00a0It's up to Izayoi Sakuya (with bunny ears!) to pound the mochi to the beat of 8-bit arrangements of famous Touhou music!</p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>Inspired by the Taiko no Tatsujin and Pop'n games, Touhou Mochitsuki Ruka is a rhythm game where pounding mochi is a musical exercise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, it isn't just any rhythm game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the normal difficulty, mochi beats will whoosh by in two different directions across two lanes. It's up to you to get both rabbits pounding mochi in time to the music. Each rabbit requires a different kind of key press to hit the colored mochi.\u00a0It's a challenging game that requires extreme concentration and skills!</p>\n<p>The game also has an easy mode.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>You control two rabbits in the course of the game. The left rabbit uses WASD and the right rabbit uses the arrow keys as depicted here.\u00a0Press W or Up to also confirm the option.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>You can pause the game with the Esc key.</p>\r\nInstallation:\r\n<p>Unzip the files and click on Bash Bash Mochi Revolution!.exe to play.</p>\r\nStaff Credits:\r\n<p><strong>Programmer:</strong> Lever<br/><strong>Composer: </strong>JerryStuff (Ro) (Twitter: @JerryStuff_Ro)<strong><br/>Artists:</strong> Jaumander (Main Character Designs, Logo)\u00a0<br/>Guessy (Cutscenes, Background Rabbits, UI)<br/><strong>Writer/Designer</strong>: Kastel (@kastelwrites)</p>\n<p>Special thanks to @minutekiwi for providing us with the background to our game.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>SFX:</strong></p>\n<p> https://freesound.org/people/thefsoundman/sounds/118513/ (great/good hit)\u00a0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/peridactyloptrix/sounds/209765/ (bad hit)<br/>https://freesound.org/people/klemmy/sounds/203343/\u00a0(Taiko)<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Tuudurt/sounds/258142/ (Stage Clear jingle)<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Smukey9/sounds/415376/ (Stage Fail jingle)<br/>https://freesound.org/people/TheMovieMacher/sounds/481652/ (Ending BGM)</p>\n<p>click3.ogg from\u00a0UI SFX Set by Kenney Vleugels (Kenney.nl)<br/>pistachio1_click.wav from UI Buttons and Whooshes Pack 1 by narfstuff</p>\n<p><em>This game was made during Touhou\u00a0Game Jam 5 where participants collaborate and make a game with original assets inspired by Touhou Project in 72 hours.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e79e6572ff919499ba96fe74b4344ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lever", "jaumander", "kastelpls"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
