The environments have been hidden beneath a mysterious fog, and the Gobblers beacon is the only constant light source in the game, and trust me, this is not the kind of light you want to be going towards! Players will soon be sitting on the edge of their seats with their heart rates racing. Where are you? Is a Gobbler nearby? Are you safe? Are you walking continually into a wall? Are you even still alive?? <br/><br/><br/>Players controlling the Pixies must use their wit and memory to recall where they are located, all the while hoping they aren\u2019t walking towards a Gobbler! Not all is doom and gloom, as Pixies are able to emit a Ping, which briefly illuminates their surroundings. Be aware, however, as you never know who might be watching, and a Gobbler may soon be chasing you down! So, illuminate your surrounds and then quickly disappear back into the shadows to escape capture and survive the Gobbler invasion!ENTER THE PIXIE REALMThe Pixie realms was once filled with light and wonder, and Pixie colonies were found across all the lands. Once idyllic, the Pixie realms have been forced into chaos. The fearsome Gobblers have invaded, and, have brought with them an unnerving darkness. Where light and colour once shone a mysterious fog has now smothered the lands.<br/><br/><br/>The Gobblers have descended upon the Pixies with the sole intention of stealing and consuming the magical essence found within a Pixie. You see, Pixies consume Moon Drops, a powerful light energy source, and transform it into an energy they can then use. The Gobblers are unable to consume pure Moon Drops, and so they hunt down all the creatures who do.FEATURES:<ul><li> Edge of your seat online and local multiplayer for 2 to 4 players.
