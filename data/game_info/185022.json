Work through the remaining empty cells, trying the numbers that have not been used. In many cases, you will find numbers that can only be placed in one position considering the other numbers that are already in its row, column, and 3\u00d73 grid.<br/>Tip 2: Break the grid up visually into 3 columns and 3 rows. Each large column will have 3, 3\u00d73 grids and each row will have 3, 3\u00d73 grids. Now, look for columns or grids that have 2 of the same number. Logically, there must be a 3rd copy of the same number in the only remaining 9-cell section. Look at each of the remaining 9 positions and see if you can find the location of the missing number.<br/>Now that you know a little more about Sudoku, play and enjoy this free online game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ec01de1a06f475e541e4d035399fc9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["debia"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
