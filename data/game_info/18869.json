{"id": 18869, "slug": "wait-extended", "name": "Wait - Extended", "name_original": "Wait - Extended", "description": "<p>&quot;Wait&quot; is a mystery horror game, inspired by the works of H.P Lovecraft and the Silent Hill series.<br />\nThe gameplay is put together by elements of exploration and riddle solving.<br />\nWe want to offer a different kind of horror. A horror without jump scares or fighting monsters, but with the fear of the unknown and unimaginable.What is &quot;Wait&quot;?<br />\nThe game is all about atmosphere and we wanted to support that by giving the player the opportunity to interact with almost every object at different times during the game.<br />\nIt&#39;s about exploration and discovering what is happening around you.<br />\nEverything in &quot;Wait&quot; is experienced by a young man, the player knows nothing about. And it&#39;s intended to be that way.<br />\nYou are literally thrown into another mans life and you can find out more about who that man is, by exploring.<br />\nHis behaviour, his characteristics are slowly revealed through interacting with objects or continuing with the story.<br />\n&quot;Wait&quot; may be inspired by the Cthulhu mythos created by Howard Phillips Lovecraft, but doesn&#39;t actually take place in it.<br />\nThere are some references here and there, but what was most important to us was the feeling and the atmosphere Lovecraft created in his stories - the fear of the unimaginable.About the project<br />\nWe originally created &quot;Wait&quot; for the 2014 Indie Game Maker Contest. It was a contest in which you had 4 weeks to create a game, using any official engine. Since the contest was hosted by the RPG Maker Team we decided to go with their engine.<br />\nAlthough the engine was made for roleplaying games, we saw potential for an adventurous horror game.<br />\nDuring development we grew fond of our little project and once the contest was over we didn&#39;t want to let go.<br />\nThere was still so much we wanted to implement, but due to the time limit of 4 weeks we could only do about half of it.<br />\nThat&#39;s when we decided to do an extended version to &quot;really&quot; finish the game, add more details, enhance some visuals, erase plot holes and add some more story content.<br />\nBut that&#39;s all just supplementary. &quot;Wait - Extended&quot; has the following features:Features:<br />\nAtmospheric exploration gameplay<br />\nAlternative endings<br />\nDynamic replayability (Successive playthroughs will not be same)<br />\nAchievement system<br />\nHidden storylines<br />\nWe hope you will have as much fun with &quot;Wait&quot;, as we have working on it. Every feedback is much appreciated.<br />\nOur website: http://www.thinkrestless.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T20:02:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d19/d19f31218013506f1ffade31458d7769.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/7052/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 37, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rest.less Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["rest.less Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
