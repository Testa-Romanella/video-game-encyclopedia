Tonight is that night.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhat Dracula did not expect was how modern day viewed his reign of terror: Cartoons. Plushies. T-shirts. To them, the Prince of Darkness was friendly. Cute, even.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt was time to remind them of the real Count Dracula.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong><strong>WHAT IS THIS?</strong></strong><br/>\r\n\tThis game was initially created for Clickteam's \"Weirder Stuff\" game jam that took place in October 2016. Unfortunately, I ran out of time to finish all the features that I wanted to implement, so the version I submitted to the Jam only had four levels and a bunch of bugs. This version right here represents the ideal version of the game that I'd wanted to submit to the Jam if I was able to finish everything properly. That being said, it's still a bit short, as it contains only five levels (\t\r\n\t<em>estimated play time: about 15 minutes</em>). <br/></p><p>\r\n\tIt's also worth saying that because this was a Game Jam game, not everything was coded with stability in mind. The game probably won't crash or anything, but if you notice bugs here or there, well... yeah, they exist. Probably a lot more than I think exist, too.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong><strong>THE GOAL OF THE GAME</strong></strong><br/>\r\n\tDracula's castle is populated by many tourists. By feeding on a tourist, you charge up Dracula's once-lost power. Feed on enough tourists, and Dracula will regain a lost ability. When there are no more tourists left, you have won the game.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>For more information on how to setup the game, what's been changed since the last version, gameplay tips and more, please read \"readme.txt\", included with the game.<br/>\n</em>\n</p><p>\n<strong><strong>OVERBITE HAS SUCCESSFULLY BEEN GREENLIT!</strong></strong><br/>\r\n\tBut that's not the end! The current game jam version of OverBite will remain on Itch.io for the time being, but if you use \"Pay What You Want\" to spend $5 or more, you will get a free Steam key when the full version of OverBite launches (estimated release date: Fall 2017). Keys will be delivered to the same email you used to pay with Paypal (or whatever is listed on your Itch.io account). <br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000fcdff3d56649be2eafec337fc2e58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hotdog Laserhouse"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
