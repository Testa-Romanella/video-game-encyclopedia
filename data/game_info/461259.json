It took me\u00a0<strong>27 hours</strong>(straight work) in <strong>29 days</strong>\u00a0to complete this game. I know it may sound small but it was colossal for me. Well, anyways here's the new game \u2665</p>\n<p>\u2666 I added a\u00a0<strong>high score\u00a0</strong>system to the game that works online.</p>\n\n<p>\u2666 You need <strong>internet connection</strong> in order to have your scores be put on the <strong>online high score board</strong>\u00a0but still you can play it\u00a0<strong>offline</strong> as well once you have entered your\u00a0<strong>username</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>\u2666 I even added a\u00a0<strong>Group\u00a0</strong>system which allows a person to create a group and then invite his friends or colleagues or simply anyone from across the globe to play in the group. It is only\u00a0<strong>\u03b2 </strong>release but I am still trying to get a way to improve it as I proceed with the updates(not quite sure) \u2665</p>\n\n<p>\u2666 I added some background music as well a few sound effects and fixed a lot(literally a whole lot) of bugs.</p>\n<p>\u2666 So just <strong>enjoy</strong> \u2666</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS :-</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u25ac\u00a0 \u00a0Use\u00a0<strong>Arrow</strong>\u00a0Keys or '<strong>A' 'D'</strong>\u00a0Keys to move around.\u00a0<br/>\u25ac\u00a0 \u00a0Use <strong>Spacebar</strong>\u00a0to <strong>shoot</strong>.<br/>\u25ac\u00a0 \u00a0Use '<strong>Esc</strong>' to <strong>pause</strong> the game.<br/>\u25ac\u00a0 \u00a0When using the\u00a0<strong>Group</strong> system please remember that all the scores are deleted if the\u00a0<strong>Host</strong> of the group leaves the group(I still haven't implemented a way for letting the other group members know that(or simply make them disconnect)) but I am thinking of creating a way for the same and that is why the\u00a0<strong>Group\u00a0</strong>system is still just a\u00a0<strong>\u03b2\u00a0</strong>release but you can get rid of the problem if you are playing with your friends as you can tell them that you are about to leave.</p>\n<p>\u2666 PS: I am still working on the android version and I would try my best to make it available for download as soon as possible till then ciao\u00a0\u2666</p>\n<p>SUPPORT it on -\u00a0<strong>Patreon</strong>\u00a0\u263b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:49:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e4/0e480a0626eb9cbf552b64af41764a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yash Kumar Gupta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
