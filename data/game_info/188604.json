The more goals, the harder you shoot.\u00a0Don't let the ball drop on the floor, you will have to try again.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Press the arrow keys to face in a direction. When you release the button, you will move in that direction.\u00a0Make sure to move towards the ball and shoot it in the direction you are facing. (Tip: Hold your arrowkey to aim and then walk!) If you hold space while shooting, the ball will fly one tile further.</p>\n<p>Of course, the goal is to get as much score as possible, but every goal increases the shooting range by one tile. This makes it harder, but also makes you get more score because you shoot harder.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Thanks for playing!</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/035/035355a30029ec88a2570ffab060226f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["namasonao"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
