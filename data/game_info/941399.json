I postponed my planned release date multiples times already. This time I wanted to finish it before the winter ends but I'm definitely not gonna make it. At this point, I have no idea how long it will take me to finish this project.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I cobbled this up in a rush for Miku Day just so I could get something out there.
