Its simple, the levels are not amazing and not everything works perfectly but without real errors. For this project that's alright, Its time to go on to the next one!</p>\n<p>This is <strong>my first complete game</strong> and <strong>feedback is appreciated</strong>. Keep in mind that I know not everything is flawless, but I'm willing to tweak small things and hear suggestions to improve things for future. Thank you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16f8048ba43df45c795339ed79588747.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GULDOR, Learning to Code"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
