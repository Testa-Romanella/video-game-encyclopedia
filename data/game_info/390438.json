Don't let it go to zero (recharge it by placing your head firmly against any asteroids)</strong><br/>Push parts onto your helm (the glowy blue thing) to attach them! <br/></p>\n<p>Press space while near the helm to enter the ship, press again to exit (make sure you don't block yer door, cause I'll laugh at you)</p>\n<p>Follow the orange arrows to find asteroids (that have more parts on them, five in total) <br/></p>\n<p>To target a new asteroids land your ship and exit for at least 5 seconds.</p>\n<p> There are 5 asteroids with progressively cooler items on em!</p>\n\n\n<p>Created for UDC 11</p>\n<p>Only WebGL 2.0 is supported, make sure your browser is up to date!<br/></p>\n<p>Web build might have some audio issues, download to fix!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:30:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/422/422b247341ba7674bdab24da36808504.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["BlipBloop"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
