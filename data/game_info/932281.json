This short project serves as a learning step in my journey towards level design / environment design.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Nature Environment is a show case of a realistic nature environment made in Unreal Engine 5. It serves as practise for me to use the various landscape, paint and foliage tools found in Unreal Engine 5, as well as the use of Nanite and Lumen for asset polygons and lighting. There are some minor issues with the build, such as assets popping out of the environment surface due to the angle of the landscape. Please note: none of the assets, excluding the landscape, have colliders present for this demonstration.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>System Requirements</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>6 Core Processor @ 4GHz or better</li><li>16GB RAM or better</li><li>RTX 3070 or better</li><li>Windows 11 [22H2 based on test configuration]</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Testing System Specifications</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ryzen 7 - 2700X 8 Core CPU</li><li>32GB RAM</li><li>RTX 2060 [Testing in engine set to High Settings: 30-40 FPS]</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T16:01:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9aa/9aa3132ee0c34952f4e29d7d27db2315.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan Dexter Ogilvie - Games Designer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
