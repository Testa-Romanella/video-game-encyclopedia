To Teleport push down the touch pad, aim where you want to teleport and relaese the touch pad (again on either hand).</p>\n<p>Being a VR game it can only be played in VR with a HTC vive. With time I will hopefully make a first person option as well so anyone can play.</p>\n<p>I recommend you clear a small area to stand in to play the game to make sure you don't hit anything.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3c/f3ca98a4105d6d8ed62e063bc5d78c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Necronmat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
