You can bypass this warning by clicking \"More Info\" and then clicking the \"Launch\" button.</p>\r\nThe single-player Icarus Proudbottom Teaches Typing web games, finally available as a single download.\r\n<p><strong>When you download this collection, you get:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Icarus Proudbottom Teaches Typing:</strong> The original game, made in one month for a Something Awful game jam. A short comedic romp through the world of typing.</li>\n<li><strong>Icarus Proudbottom's World of Typing Weekly:</strong> The messy, episodic, overly-ambitious sequel, heavily inspired by Twin Peaks. Solve an otherwordly murder mystery over the course of five episodes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Mac version coming ASAP.</strong> Sorry, Mac friends.
