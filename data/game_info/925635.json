Through that a magician appeared wanting to help him (We don't know if it is to use the boy in the future), he would help him in exchange for questions and with each question the young man's knowledge increased and he took advantage and acquired materials to help him fight the wizard's difficult questions. </p>\r\npatch note:\r\n<p>The game is incomplete. <br/>*needs to develop the time system by getting the question right or wrong, increasing and decreasing according to the answer. <br/>*needs to develop the saving of the person's name in the game's global list. <br/>*need to develop the character's help shop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:55:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb8/eb82496105146f54d59ad6015d6bf3db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["andrefelipebarros"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
