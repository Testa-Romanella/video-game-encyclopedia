Using the spacey balls, our player scores by finding and removing non-functioning algorithms. The player activates special tasks which allow for use of multipliers, using the multipliers allows the player to collect even more non-functioning algorithms in a given time period.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Shift\u00a0 = Left Flippers\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Trigger = Left Flippers\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Shift = Right Flippers\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Trigger = Right Flippers\r\n</p>\n<p>Space Bar(Hold) = Pull Plunger\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Face Button = Pull Plunger\r\n</p>\n<p>Ctrl Left = Tilt Left\r\n</p>\n<p>Ctrl Right = Tilt Right\r\n</p>\n<p>Enter = Accept\r\n</p>\n<p>Bottom Face Button = Accept\r\n</p>\n<p>Esc = Open Menu\r\n</p>\n<p>Start Button = Open Menu\r\n</p>\n<p>KeyBoard = To Enter High Score Name.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Story!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Universal Quantifier is\u2026. Running out of space. You are a Universal Software Engineer, and it is your job to clear out old non-functioning algorithms.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately the Universal Quantifier is Running out of Space. There is little space left and it is causing Chaos, dimensional rifts and black holes. You will have to flipper your way through space/time. Clearing out as many non-functioning algorithms as you can while at the same time, saving the Universal Quantifier from Chaos.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our Submission for the Epic Mega Jam 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T05:59:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47f/47f3c87af207cf9e5cad0c3eff730546.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Dev_onian", "WormJuice"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
