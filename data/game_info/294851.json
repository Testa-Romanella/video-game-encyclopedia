The Diamond is rumored to have the mysterious power to cause everything that can go wrong to go wrong - bad weather to appear, items of importance to disappear, engines to fail and ships to sink. You know you are getting closer to finding the diamond as more things go wrong throughout your journey. The only person unaffected by the diamond's powers is whomever it's previous owner was, whom you know not, though whoever he is, he is probably dead... at least... that's what you assume...</p>\n<p>NOTE: This is a short excerpt of the game play, the game itself in in the alpha stage of development.
