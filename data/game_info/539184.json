They're mischievous little critters though, always getting in the way. Don't worry, you can pick them up and throw them where you want. They won't stay there for long though.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the wide range of color combinations possible when selecting breeding pairs. And here's a weird hint about these rabbits... their genes get more unstable with each new generation! Luckily, mutated bunnies have a higher chance of producing the best Easter Eggs.</p>\n<p>How many carrots can you earn?<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to enjoy our game.</p>\n<p>Special Thanks:</p>\n<p>Kyle Breslow - Programming<br/></p>\n<p>Megan Breslow - Artist</p>\n<p>Sl\u00e1inte - Music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:04:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/685/6852478f04d7d0ff997d615433b77223.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gnomebrew"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
