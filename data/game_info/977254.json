Don't worry.<br/>Kayla is here to help you relax<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I designed this [Adult Puzzle] series to be enjoyable without being overly challenging. I mean, why stress out unnecessarily? <br/>Each game in the series is designed to be easily beatable, so you can unwind without frustration.<br/><br/>The game includes a zoom feature. You can double-click or scroll to zoom in on the pictures in the gallery. (I wanted to mention this in case you want to take a closer look... for scientific research purposes, of course! -ba dum tss)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There's also a music player in the game, so you can dance while you play, or you can simply turn it off if it's not to your liking. Everyone has the right to enjoy the game in silence and peace, right?<br/><br/>Hope you'll enjoy any game of the series.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks in advance !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T03:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90f/90fce06fecef5e7a9b88102b3c1fbbcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["simplecakestudio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["simplecakestudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
