It was originally conceived for the Brackey\u2019s 2021.2 Game Jam with the theme being \u201cLet there be chaos\u201d but I decided I wanted to continue development because I saw potential for the game. The game is still designed to follow the theme of the jam. In the current build of the game, there are two power-ups with archetypes, two enemy types and a mechanic I like to refer to as \"hazards\" which are either permanent or temporary gameplay changes designed to make the game more challenging. These hazards appear after a certain amount of time so be careful! This game is meant to be challenging while still being fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T07:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a47c1adf8b864a0301fb9e4cbddb922a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MasterRDF"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
