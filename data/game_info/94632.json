Destroy the enemy spawn points to take tactical advantage.</p>\n<p>I tried to make the controls as responsive as possible to provide an intuitive and easy control. All you need is reactions and shooting accuracy. \u00a0Have fun with the\u00a0dynamic shootouts, adrenaline and a lot of TNT!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Test concepts for feedback</strong>(PreAlpha_03), ideas are welcome:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. Stickness Level - Increased on killing, gives you some bonuses like faster healing for over 50% of the level.</p>\n<p>2. Special skills -\u00a0currently there's one -\u00a0 slowing time with\u00a0Mouse 2. Using special skill consumes stickness level.</p>\n<p>I may create more skills (like force field that limits the\u00a0taken damage).</p>\n<p><strong>The full game</strong> is planned to\u00a0contain more levels, weapons and emenies (incl. bosses).<br/></p>\n\n<p>More effects, visual upgrades and so on. Soon in 2018.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97e/97e1a941294e063c9459aa5b2c0d93a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["v_savov"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
