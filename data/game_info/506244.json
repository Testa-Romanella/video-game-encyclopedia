See what all the fuss is about.</p>\n<p>Instead of food in this skinner box, there is sound. Will you become conditioned to spam that button?? Who knows... but there are 20 sounds in total to hear.</p>\n<p>----- Dev Notes -----</p>\n<p>Yeah so I\u00a0heard the prompt (Non-Human POV for anyone not aware of the jam)\u00a0and instantly thought about rats bc I\u00a0have rat brain all the time. While I\u00a0came up with a few ideas, I wasn't really thrilled about any of them.\u00a0Then I\u00a0was thinking about game design stuff when I\u00a0remembered the\u00a0Skinner Box and operant conditioning. That has rats in it doesn't it. I\u00a0really liked that concept because its so closely tied to games but the original concept is a non-human pov. I\u00a0ran into my first roadblock with the idea when I realized that food would not be motivation enough for a player to keep playing. Sure I could make a hunger meter and tell the player to not die but it didn't seem fun.\u00a0So instead, taking a lesson from clicker games, I went in the direction of discovery. Instead of a known need, I\u00a0thought an unknown want might keep a players attention while still fulfilling the basic prompt. I ended up going with sound because I liked the idea of putting fun memes in my game. This class has been\u00a0hard so let me have some fun with it.\u00a0 Also I decided to show a possible range until the next sound \"drop\" because I\u00a0figured while it is not true to the original skinner box experiment, it is another QoL feature for the human players.</p>\n<p>----- Sound List\u00a0 (Read after playing)\u00a0-----</p>\n<ol><li>Mario Coin Noise</li><li>Roblox Death Sound</li><li>First 4 Notes of Megolovania</li><li>Anime Wow Sound Effect</li><li>Minecraft Drinking Noise</li><li>Intro to Money Machine by 100\u00a0Gecs</li><li>EA Sports but its all Es</li><li>JFK from Clone High saying \"Damn your ass fat, whats your pronouns\"</li><li>Gamecube Intro</li><li>Bass Boosted Fortnite Default Dance Theme</li><li>Intro to Revenge by CaptainSparklez</li><li>Look at this Graph Nickleback Vine</li><li>Clip of Two Trucks by LemonDemon</li><li>Miku reads the Navy Seal CopyPasta</li><li>Seteth (from Fire Emblem: Three Houses) McDonalds Quest</li><li>All Star by Smash Mouth\u00a0but he won't spare some change for gas</li><li>Lego City commercial bass boosted</li><li>Remix of That's What I\u00a0Like by Bruno Mars</li><li>Chorus of Caramelldansen by the Caramella Girls</li><li>Eggman's Announcement from Snapcube's Sonic Adventure 2 Real-Time Fandub</li></ol>\n<p>-----KNOWN BUGS-----</p>\n<p>1.0/1.1 - Camera can sometimes flip upside-down\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T05:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bb/3bba65049acd437fd0e7d7ff7ece9a67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Miles Logan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
