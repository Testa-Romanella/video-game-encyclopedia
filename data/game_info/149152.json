It's an oldschool tile-matching game, which offers a really hardcore challenge for your mind and reaction. Certain numbers fall from above in groups of four, and on the bottom their destiny waits for them: the same numbers add up and the different ones accumulate.<br/>Do you think you can cope with them? Well, try, but please don't think that it will be so easy. Set the game's difficulty according to your agility, find the right place for every game piece and try to gain maximum points by creating horizontal lines of ten blocks with a same number!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe5/fe5b3e8e1c031d0755a25acf1fae8013.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bristlysun"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
