{"id": 128224, "slug": "ld36-clockwork-dragon", "name": "LD36 Clockwork Dragon", "name_original": "LD36 Clockwork Dragon", "description": "<p>In your mountain lair, you have slept for aeons. Now, your steel bones rumble and your furnaces are once more aflame. Play as a clockwork dragon, flying around raiding villages and hoarding gold. <br/> <br/>Use WASD or arrow keys to fly, E to enter or leave your lair (when you are close), R to roar, Space to use your attack, and 1-5 to select an attack when you have purchased them from your lair. <br/> <br/>I haven't tested the WebGL version but feel free to give it a go. I made it mostly within the Compo period following the competition rules but decided to enter the jam so I could take a few hours to add some nice-to-have tweaks like the pile of gold in your lair and the watch towers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fe/7fe84bf14cefc28fb11f39b7ad7a1f23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["wilsk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
