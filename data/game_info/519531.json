When playing you are up against an endless hoard of mobs. Upon death a mob will drop a new Card to be added to you hand. Due to time constraints the only set of cards I was able to implement were the weapon cards. Each weapon has unique stats and appearance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tip: use your weapons for movement as well as combat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SOURCE CODE</strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/Sephta/mixjam-submission</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>Code - Me<br/>Art - Me<br/>SFX:<br/> * Sounds By Dame @SounsByDane on itch.io<br/> * User Kronbits \"200 free sfx pack\" on itch.io<br/> * Kenny Assets by Kenny<br/>Music - Kennys Assets ()</p>\n<p>Some code was written before the jam period.
