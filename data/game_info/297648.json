You will need a good memory and a strong vocabulary. Most of the letters are facing away from you and the hand-built challenges are full of those wonderful English words whose letters don't follow the usual patterns.<br/><br/>Lexiblox is a completely unique 3D word game. Every puzzle, every sound, all the music, all the graphics and all the programming were produced just for this app. The result is purely novel with a relaxed, playful vibe. Lexiblox is difficult to put down, but it's easy to pick up whenever you have a few minutes to get lost in concentration.<br/><br/>Lexiblox is a paid app, ready for hours of enjoyment as soon as you buy it. When you do, you'll be supporting an indie developer with a straightforward business model. There are no ads, currencies, or downloads to interrupt your concentration. Good luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b70/b70e22e87a84c8db9a9e78c3163a1861.jpg", "website": "http://www.adducive.com/lexiblox/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Brian Krause"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Brian Krause"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
