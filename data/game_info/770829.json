The player must solve these puzzles in order to escape from the facility; carrying with them the prototype gravity device and bringing it back to their buyer. The player will go from room to room, discovering new challenges, and must find new ways to think their way through the environment. Dodging bullets and bypassing laser systems while using gravity altering controls, players must do everything they can in order to reach the end and escape the lab. Gravity Heist is great for players who want to spend a little more time thinking through different puzzles and parts of the game.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>'A' and 'D' to move</p>\n<p>'E' to interact</p>\n<p>'Space' to change gravity</p>\n\r\nGravity Flip:\r\n<p>When the Gravity Flip is activated by the player, the current direction of the force of gravity applied to the player switches by 180\u00b0. The player is able to use the Gravity Flip whenever they are considered grounded, meaning they can\u2019t use it while in mid-air. The Gravity Flip makes the player's old ceiling their new floor, and vice versa. This allows the player to choose where they want to be on the map, making it easier for them to get over or avoid certain obstacles.\u00a0</p>\r\nGravity Wedges:\r\n<p>Placed in corners throughout the map, Gravity Wedges allow the player to move onto the adjacent wall once triggered. When the player triggers a Gravity Wedge and moves onto the adjacent wall, the map and camera rotate 90\u00b0 along with the player. Just like the Gravity Flip, this allows the player to take a new approach to the environment and allows them to avoid certain obstacles.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T15:02:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58e/58ea706db8410126c2b6642f1c6edcf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rain8750", "Sukhbir", "PentaHex Studios", "GavinC600"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
