{"id": 492229, "slug": "compost", "name": "Compost", "name_original": "Compost", "description": "Compost is fun and easy to play with only a mouse. It is a mash of ecological simulator and fast paced arcade. The goal of the game is to see how many waves you can endure without losing all your plants. Plants are your lives. There are many plants!<br/><br/>There are also many bugs, many robots,  and even some environmental hazards such as fire and smog. Heck even the plants compete with other plants. Nothing is interested in you though: You're an immortal wind god! And you interact with everything by blowing things around and toggling behaviors by clicking on the huge amount of bugs, robots, and plants. <strong>Anything</strong> you see can be clicked. Through this somewhat indirect interaction you can ensure the survival of the garden. Though you don't have to interact a lot:<br/><br/>All the plants, bugs, and robots have their <strong>own behaviors and lives!</strong> They romance. They lay eggs. They eat, joust, move, and more. These are not copy pasted enemies with one track minds. Each one does something unique for you to discover. Take into account their unique behaviors to form strategies to overcome the random threats that are constantly arriving with each new wave.<br/><br/>Oh and you can blow things up. Blow shrapnel at locusts. OBLITERATE ALL THE MORTALS. Make them burn in atomic hellfires. If that interests you. It's fun!<br/><br/>Play Compost Today!<br/><br/>Compost was developed by a single person over the course of 20 months. It uses the Godot engine, the best engine.<br/><br/>All bug limbs, flower petals, and giblets of gore and their physics are simulated and drawn with code in absence of animations and sprites.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T11:12:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/798/7983b4deb29a077dc1bb87ccb451ff83.jpg", "website": "https://gamejolt.com/@spess", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Midnight Warden"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Superfantastic Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
