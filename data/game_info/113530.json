The player is given very little information to go off when deciding whether to label someone as a terrorist or not, this is to draw comparison to how many people who have an islamophobic view will judge people based on very little to no knowledge of the person they judge. However no matter how they judge a single person in our game none of the people are terrorist, which seeks to show people who may judge various people as terrorist with next to no information to go on besides there name and where they're from or what they look like that the person they seek to label as a terrorist is not going to be a terrorist.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tDakota Wood - Programmer\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIsmail Ghadban - Designer\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBailey Fitness - Designer\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSound effects sourced from Sound Dogs.</p><p>Some portraits sourced from Google.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e07/e078e62ab8018fc5fc2ee1f98fb69824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SYNC", "ighadban", "Baileyfit"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
