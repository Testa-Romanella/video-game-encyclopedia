Or backslashes.</p><p>This is a stupid game I made on Twine.</p><p>Will you be a wizard attempting to sell hand lotion to a ravishing dinosaur?<br/>Will you be a Roomba, plotting for the destruction of humanity?<br/>Will you create a creature that was never meant to be seen by the eyes of man?<br/>Will you become one with Film Noir?<br/>Or will you be an angsty snail leaving hateful comments on YouTube videos?<br/>All this and more is possible if you play the game!</p><p>This my first attempt at a game. I mostly just like telling stories, so I kinda suck at making things look nice (By the way, all art is made by me, in the most quality of programs: MS Paint). Lots of different choices though. Take your time exploring your options.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2b/a2b468743e0a3f7a79e5dff7b174afbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fortwas"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
