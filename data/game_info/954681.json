It started off as a fun project in NESmaker but got more and more serious as things like enemies, power ups and level design started to fall into place. I have spent hundreds of hours working on this game to make it as authentic as possible. My big goal with this game is to recreate the experience from the late 80s and early 90s. All the way from how the physical box and manual look and feel, to how the game itself looks and plays.</p>\n\n<p>You can see more screenshots and read about the game on the board-b homepage:</p>\n<p>http://board-b.com/nosey-joe-the-power-mystery/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T09:33:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c57/c57f31bef2bb467f836ebcc33fd51bf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["baardbi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
