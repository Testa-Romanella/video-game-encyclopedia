I asked my cousin Arnold Gecain to draw the character for this game. Also I'm joining other game jams that's why I didn't have much time to improve the game. This is just a prototype but still hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:52:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b32/b32dc935facb2a79075b0c8ce88b2132.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kahltech Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
