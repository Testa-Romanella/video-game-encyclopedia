These have given you the power to make objects move back in time, more specifically travel back the way they previously moved. You are aware of the danger you could be to society if you fell in the wrong hands, this is why you decide only to use your power if given a green flag, symbol of nature and peace. Try escaping the vile scientists who gave you this malediction and save the world from your malediction! To get out of this lab of madness, you have to go through some rooms, dodging security agents and dangers of all sorts. Push boxes to walk on top of holes or block lasers, grab flags to fuel your power and click on yourself or on\u00a0items to make them move back in time. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Commands:</p>\n<p>- WASD to move your character</p>\n<p>- Click on items/character to initiate the reversion process</p>\n<p>-Escape to return to the menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T13:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a8/5a8a2e2887ba7c1e7011eb486f5bef96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MartinWho2"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
