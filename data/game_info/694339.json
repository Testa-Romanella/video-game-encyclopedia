Being a 2D platformer inspired by the classic hit Geometry Dash the player controls a square using the arrow keys, along with clicking via a computer mouse(pad) to click through text scenes. However, unlike its inspiration game, Inconsistent Dash is consistently inconsistent (which is inconsistent since game jam participants shouldn\u2019t upload a consistent game for an Inconsistent themed game jam)!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>To enjoy the game to its fullest make sure to pay careful attention to the level objectives and just have fun with it!\r\n</p>\n<p>--\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Arrows = Movement\r\n</li><li>Up-arrow = Jump\r\n</li><li>Pause = Click the Pause icon in the corner of the game during gameplay.\r\n</li><li>\u201cp\u201d key = Pause\r\n</li><li>\u201cr\u201d key = Restart\r\n</li><li>Click = Move to next game scene and/or interact with UI/UX elements\r\n</li><li>Esc = in the Pause Menu Click \u201cEsc\u201d to quit the game\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>--\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sophia Chang - Programmer (Programming, Prototyping)\r\n</p>\n<p>Mia Chyung - Game Composer (Music, Art)\r\n</p>\n<p>David Tan - Programmer (Programming, Level Design)\r\n</p>\n<p>Paul Young - Game Designer (Game Design, SFX, Art)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T12:04:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/8470b74ca58d77edb9ab5e865f24b161.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DTanxxx", "PaulthePhilosophyGuy", "farout"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
