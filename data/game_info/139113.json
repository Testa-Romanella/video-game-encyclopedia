But some unique mechanics to them are that Galleons can attack twice, which no other unit in the game can do, and if your smart you can use naval units to attack land units either directly next to the shore with most units, or up to 4 tiles in to the shore with the Galleon. Oh, and privateers have a 50% chance of capturing enemy units when they kill them... which means creating a new unit of that same type you just killed on your team, starting at half health. (Does not work on enemy land units!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bce40a4db518ece792af980d1b2e8488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adventurer32"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
