I also implemented other contents including \u201cChallenge\u201d, \u201cFever Mode\u201d, and \u201cHigh and low\u201d. But I don\u2019t know whether they are interacted with each other well. So I would be so happy if you give me any feedback or ideas!!</p>\n<p>Feel free to join my discord and let's talk!</p>\n<p>Discord :\u00a0https://discord.gg/jaZNjfctRZ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:45:35", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Surume Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
