While none of the GBIP species have their own military, there is still a need for a peacekeeping force. Thus, the Arbiters were created.</p>\n<p>You have just joined the Arbiter ranks\u2014whether you wanted to or not. This prestigious position comes with a fair amount of perks, including your own ship and crew. However, it\u2019s also the most dangerous job in the galaxy. When a small colony faces an attack from an unknown source, you\u2019re sent to investigate. What you uncover reveals a danger far greater\u2014and far closer to home\u2014than you could have ever expected.\r\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>A fully customizable MC - Choose your name, pronouns, appearance, background, personality, etc.\r\n</li><li>A varied cast of aliens and humans alike (4 of whom you can smooch).\r\n</li><li>Approach missions in ways that play to your strengths\u2014or not. Failure may be just as fun as succeeding.\r\n</li><li>An in-depth personality and stats system that creates variation in scenes depending on how you develop your MC.\r\n</li><li>A glossary that builds as you play the game, providing extra information on everything from alien species to new technology.\r\n</li><li>Name your ship! :)\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Commander Alex Kuang\u00a0</strong>(F/M/NB - Player Determined)<strong>:</strong>\u00a0Your closest friend and newly-appointed first officer. They\u2019ve already made a name for themselves throughout the Galactic Alliance for being both the top recruit in your class as well as painfully gorgeous. Only a select few know what their cool fa\u00e7ade is really covering.\r\n</li><li><strong>Flight Lieutenant Sam Channing\u00a0</strong>(F/M - Player Determined)<strong>:</strong>\u00a0 Your new pilot\u2014the best in the Alliance if the rumors are to be believed. While they never seem to take anything seriously, their open and carefree personality makes them wildly popular amongst just about everyone but their superiors.\r\n</li><li><strong>Lieutenant Nereus of the Soundless Deep\u00a0</strong>(M)<strong>:</strong>\u00a0Your communications specialist and sole Otnean crew member. Although his appearance may be initially frightening to those unused to being around one of his species, he\u00a0<em>is\u00a0</em>the CommSpec for a reason\u2014and a damn good one. Looks can be deceiving, after all.\r\n</li><li><strong>Chief Engineer Katalina Lindbeck\u00a0</strong>(F)<strong>:</strong>\u00a0Your ship\u2019s head mechanic\u2014your ship\u2019s\u00a0<em>only\u00a0</em>mechanic if she has anything to say about it. Her coarse exterior may be a turn-off to some, but others find her blunt honesty refreshing. She also happens to be a notorious flirt with a heartbreaker reputation.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>DEV BLOG | KO-FI</p>\n<p>UI CREDIT:\u00a0VAHNYA</p>\n\n<p>Fullscreen recommended</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T08:00:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3d/a3d830d1bc50f3ca4de8533f63a6d489.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JupiterGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
