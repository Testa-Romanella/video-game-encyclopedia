And on top of that, I've made multiple stupid decisions while I did have time to work on it.<br/>So the game is very much in an incomplete state, and I have no plans on properly finishing it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T19:18:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ed/6edb204f6df19eb407c57bad1705a63b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pampogokiraly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
