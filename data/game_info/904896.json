You must escape.<br/>Use the Arrow Keys, or WASD to move. Try to get to the Yellow\u00a0Square as Fast as possible. You are the Yellow Circle. DO NOT touch the dark red.\u00a0The fortress security will get more diverse and challenging the more you travel through it.<br/>Good Luck.<br/>There will be future updates, like new levels, modes, bosses and more.
