During the</p>\n<p>initialization phase, the Aggressive Residents are randomibly scattered around the Path Ways, which are</p>\n<p>represents by the number 2s and at the end numbers 3,4 &amp; 5 are used to determine if Red has travelled the</p>\n<p>correct path or is simply been unlucky. I've been describing this game as a Role-Play type game as all the</p>\n<p>Luck needs to go Red to be successful.</p>\n<p>Problems Encountered</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Atariage forum, I could improve on some of my BASIC coding habits and save some</p>\n<p>keystrokes, which has allowed me to simplify a number of WHILE..WEND statements to act the same way as</p>\n<p>IF..THEN statements.</p>\n<p>I also needed a routine to select 1s or -1s, so when an Aggressive Resident pops up, if the player presses</p>\n<p>Left or Right has the Aggressive Resident decided to attack where Red decides to move and if so, to take</p>\n<p>action. Thanks to the Atariage forum again for finding some code which works on my Amstrad CPC.</p>\n<p>Another problem I had relates to the 3,4 &amp; 5 numbers I have to select at the end of the Path. Each number is</p>\n<p>Randomibly selected and then placed on 3 places, however numbers can only appear once and after looking</p>\n<p>at a similiar routine I'd used on another game I made, worked out a way, so numbers are only selected once,</p>\n<p>this is critical in changing the value at the end of each path and where the luck comes in as part of the game.</p>\n<p>Example of the game</p>\n<p>11111111111111</p>\n<p>11111111111111</p>\n<p>11111111111111</p>\n<p>11111111111111</p>\n<p>11111111111111</p>\n<p>11111111111111</p>\n<p>11111111111111</p>\n<p>14111113111511</p>\n<p>00001000010200</p>\n<p>00001000012000</p>\n<p>00210000001000</p>\n<p>00010020000100</p>\n<p>00100000200100</p>\n<p>00100000201000</p>\n<p>00010000201000</p>\n<p>00012000010000</p>\n<p>00010002100000</p>\n<p>00100000100002</p>\n<p>00100000010020</p>\n<p>00012000010000</p>\n<p>00010020001000</p>\n<p>00201000001000</p>\n<p>00000100001200</p>\n<p>02000100010000</p>\n<p>00021000010000</p>\n<p>00001020100000</p>\n<p>00010000100200</p>\n<p>20010000100000</p>\n<p>00210000010000</p>\n<p>02010000001000</p>\n<p>00001000002000</p>\n<p>00021000001000</p>\n<p>00010020001000</p>\n<p>00000000210000</p>\n<p>00010020010000</p>\n<p># Key '0' = Space, '1' = Wall, '2' Aggressive Resident, '3' Safe Exit, '4' Unsafe Exit, '5' Unsafe Exit #2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T05:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/9211ebf0e79ae410409c616dadeda14b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
