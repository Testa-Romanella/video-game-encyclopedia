The birds remember commands you've given and will repeat them, so for example you can tell a bird to repeatedly collect logs and place them somewhere.</p>\n<p>This is a proof of concept rather than a playable game. It\u00a0was my first time making a factory builder (automation) style game and also my first time making pixel art! (Though the majority of art in the game is by other artists following the LPC style.)</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Left click: Select birds, place conveyors<br/>Right click: Give commands, remove commands<br/>Space bar: Toggle whether the bird repeats the commands you've given<br/>Arrow keys: Rotate conveyors when placing them</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Almost all the visual assets are thanks to other artists.
