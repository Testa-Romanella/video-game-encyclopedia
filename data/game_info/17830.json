As part of the HumbleBundle pack, a soundtrack for the game is available, which was released separately. The game began to be developed in 2007. It took four years to build the first demo version for the Penny Arcade Expo. The action of the game is developed on a distant planet and includes the exploration of the game world, like the games of the Metroidvania series. The game was played by the famous artist Michel Gagn\u00e9.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game offers the player to solve two-dimensional puzzles, which are mixed with the active segments of the gameplay. The player can upgrade the ship, which he controls: it happens with the help of extraterrestrial technology. The main task is to save the home planet from destruction. The game is available on Steam. There are game modes that support up to 4 players, but you can not play in a basic coop. To do so on console one will need an online subscription to play over the net. The story of the game is rather short - the player will need approximately 4 hours to complete it.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2011-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-23T06:42:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cc/0cc6a55041978168782e99e1cf7887a0.jpg", "website": "http://insanelytwistedshadowplanet.com", "rating": 3.59, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 73, "owned": 1074, "beaten": 50, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 29, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 73, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 75, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Shadow Planet Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
