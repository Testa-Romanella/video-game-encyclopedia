'Saloon Switcheroo' is a two-player local-multiplayer shooter.<br/></p>\n<p>How it fits the theme 'Out Of Control':</p>\n<p>Aside from being out of control in the hectic sense, every so often you will get a switcheroo, which can be one of four things that alter how the characters are controlled:</p>\n\n<p>Drunk: Your controls will be scrambled, except for your shoot button.</p>\n\n<p>Swap Legs: You control your opponent's movement, but your own character's shooting. You will have to try and make your opponent run in front of your character and then shoot them. During this switcheroo you automatically pick up items in range.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Swap Controls: Your controls are swapped with your opponent's. But, you still control your original character, so you and your opponent will have to quickly change seats or reach over one another.</p>\n<p>Flip: All controls go back to normal, but the screen goes upside down.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:30:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f837ccb83b22a29f2821544ab75e6359.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Woafer"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
