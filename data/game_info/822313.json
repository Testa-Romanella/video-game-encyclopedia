Picking up items and monuments\u00a0could be a boon or a barrier to gaining points and finding more monument pieces. Discover more dice rolls and save the world in \"Point of No Return\"\u00a0by playing it yourself!</p>\n<p>This was our first game jam. Our scope was a little larger than we could handle, and we wish we could have spent more time adding ways to push your luck for more points. We wanted to create a feeling of risk vs reward, but where the risk and reward\u00a0is randomly decided each run.</p>\n<p>Would love to hear feedback, and looking forward to next year's game jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T15:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d5686a557110f639ba46391b7bbe015.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["rasselbock", "Bencer"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
