Something strange has happened and you want to leave, follow the way to finding the exit from this waking nightmare of Fort Lytton.<br/></p><p>This game is a simple environment that is divided between two areas that the player has to unlock. There is low light throughout the level, along with some minor interactions that include a pile of chrome balls that are pile in an artillery pit, an unlockable gate in the middle of the map (the key is after the balls) and a glowing pipe that will be fixed by interaction to unlock the last room. This environment is a slow play application for the slow player or one that wants to play in a dark virtual world.</p><p>Interactions:-</p><p>-Vanishing Doors</p><p>-Ball Pit</p><p>-Sensor Lights</p><p>-Fix it Event</p><p>-Smackable Debris (Second Area Key)</p><p>Music Ambiance:</p><p>Mashup utilising Public Domain from http://soundbible.com/tags-scary.html</p><p>Assets:</p><p>The prefabricated ones was sourced from  https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/infinity-blade-fire-lands<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T08:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6e/a6eb58cde016a4d239ad6b807a4acfbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["virtualenvironments"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
