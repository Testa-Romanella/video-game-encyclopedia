Nothing complicated - just fly forward and destroy enemy ships. On the way there will be buffs such as an increase of attack speed, an increase of movement speed,\u00a0 and the\u00a0hp regen. Enemies\u00a0will appear more and more often, so try to score the maximum number of points and have a good\u00a0time listening to cool dynamic music.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0Use ARROWS on keyboard to move and SPACE to shoot.</p>\n\n<p>This project is my introduction to Godot Engine and I hope you will like it. All the sprites were drawn by me and the soundtrack was written by my friend. Thanks for background to Deep-Fold.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T16:05:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd7/dd79463ef7be32196c108a08f68ae847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SwitgZ"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
