This was originally being made in Clickteam Free Edition. But now I think it should just be an FNAF Engine test. This started out as an FNAF 1 Remake, but since I want it to be published, I cannot let it have FNAF 1's assets, or else I would get in legal trouble. So I morphed FNAF 1 Remade into FNAFMSPE. This is just a quick project made with FNAF Engine just to show what's possible with the engine.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:11:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e9/2e96262b1a5e3d04f2e59b50eb356536.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S.P.L Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
