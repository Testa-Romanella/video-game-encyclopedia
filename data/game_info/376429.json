You can also pickup and build with broken blocks, to make little proto-houses or set up elemental contraptions or experiments, or just write out an angry worded letter to your congressman about how he's sold everyone out for a box of donuts and\u00a0hush money to pay for his abortion.\u00a0 It's all up to you, real basic stuff, it will prolly crash, there's no goal or game, just mechanics to mess around with.
