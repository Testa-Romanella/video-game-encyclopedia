The rules are very simple:</p>\n<ul><li>Click on a square to change it to a random different color</li><li>You may not click the same square twice in a row</li><li>You win when you get all the squares to the same color</li></ul>\n<p>Roll the mouse wheel to choose between 10 difficulty levels. The goal is to win in the fewest clicks and the shortest time. Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e38576bc7bdc7e5bdf73e39777dd9f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LordKevnar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
