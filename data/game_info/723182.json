I have been leisurely writing code during my free time up to this point and making games mostly for study purposes when I was hit with the idea of working with a team. The timing was right.. there was another Brackey's game jam coming up and the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing meaning I had nowhere to go, had limited interactions with people and had free time I was more than willing to spend. I got in touch with my dev partner through the jam's dedicated Discord server\u00a0and, until the very end, we fought the 14-hour time difference (they were based in South America)\u00a0to create the first version of Dragon War. If I'm going to be honest, I thought the project was a bit ambitious\u00a0right off the bat.. especially for a short game jam.\u00a0However, I\u00a0knew the team had plans for it even beyond the scope of the jam and I\u00a0liked the ambition they possessed. Fast forward to after the jam. The game\u00a0was not perfect for sure, the reviews not that high, but it served as fuel, for me especially, to use the existing material and story I had to better it and learn about concepts along the way that I\u00a0have not even heard of before.<br/></p>\n<p>With the future of Dragon War currently uncertain, I leave this here to serve\u00a0as a remembrance to the\u00a0\u00a0humongous mountain of problems and worries that me and my teammates were able to overcome and the bond we made during and after the jam. 2.0 is the product of\u00a0my solo attempt to continue Dragon War and improve its universe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T05:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c68/c689178cb1737f82a512867996aca555.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kat Lee"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
