I am a fan of such series of games as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Dead Space, Mass Effect. Also, I was inspired by such films as Alien, The\u00a0thing, Predator, Blade Runner,\u00a0Prometheus and others. \u00a0In this demo, I tried to convey the atmosphere of retro representations of the science fiction of the future. \u00a0Old journals and scientific hypotheses were also used.</p>\n<p>If the project collects sufficient financial support, absolutely everything in the game will be transferred\u00a0<strong>from scratch</strong>\u00a0and meet the\u00a0<strong>required quality. \u00a0This will allow me to switch game development to a new version of the engine (currently using iMac 21'mid 2011 + Unity 5.6.4f), which requires more powerful hardware.</strong>A large story campaign requires a lot of resources and I have a lot to tell you.\u00a0Check out the\u00a0<strong>roadmap</strong>\u00a0for details. I would be very happy if you share your impressions so that I can\u00a0<strong>make the game better.</strong></p>\n<p>========</p>\r\nKnown bugs:\r\n<p>_Inventory is not saved when switching to a new scene or when saving.</p>\n<p>_Some items may not have a correct description.</p>\n<p>_Occasionally, during the game, long freezes / intermittent screen movement may occur.</p>\r\nHave a good game.
