Go deeper and deeper into the mind, defeat doubts, problems, sins, mistakes, and anything that plagues the mind. Grab cool weapons, upgrade your stats, make decisions, avoid monsters, kill monsters, and make it to the core, and fight the deepest rooted things in the mind.</p>\n<p>Right now, MindScape is still in early development, but I'll be uploading new builds every month, with new bosses, floors, weapons, and other things. if you want to give me feedback and suggestions of any kind, tell me about bugs you find, or if you just want to get notifications about my game, join my discord server at\u00a0https://discord.gg/5esTfth. See you there :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T03:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/eda25d0712fc29bb8a3687ded01346d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuckBruhby"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
