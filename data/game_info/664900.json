It is reportedly dotted with obelisks emitting some kind of holographic glyphs and binary controls.  Set a course for TRAPPIST-1, intercept the monolith, and investigate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Due to the nature of this voyage, your screen has been outfitted with vacuum-tolerant pixaels, a more resilient form of pixel. This does however preclude the use of advertisements or in-visor purchases.
