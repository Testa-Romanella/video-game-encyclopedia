{"id": 560100, "slug": "somebunny-help", "name": "Somebunny Help", "name_original": "Somebunny Help", "description": "<p>Help the bunny escape rooms by collecting carrots and ripe bananas! The door is only accessible when everything edible is collected. Use the keyboard arrow keys or WASD to move within the space and beware of toxic coconuts (and a shark)!</p>\n<p>Development Process:</p><p>I was inspired by the idea of a hungry bunny stuck in chamber in a spaceship. It was a very random idea but I was attracted to the idea of how some objects could be kicked around with zero gravity. I remembered how my friend's bunny loved to eat carrots and bananas, so I decided to incorporate those as objects that could be collected. I also wanted to add unripe bananas and hard fruits like coconuts that are inedible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Successes:<br/></p>\n<p>I tried to create a consistent, playful visual theme with the graphics I created. They came from my imagination of a hungry bunny trying to escape a dark room with food. There are ripe bananas and carrots that can be collected while unripe coconuts, bananas, and a shark can become obstacles. I think the speed of how the bunny travels within the game works well with the flow of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Failures / Future Development:</p>\n<p>I wanted to import sound by creating them on bfxr, but it didn't work out so well with my laptop. I think there are a couple of things I need to figure out before having it work properly. Another thing for improvement is that the game is straightforward, with obstacles and treats that can be avoided and collected easily. Perhaps if there were more interactive movements that were made by the traps themselves it would be more interesting to play.\u00a0</p><p>Also, it was difficult to animate the bunny, I think I kept messing up the logic of the movement, but moving on, I would incorporate animation onto the player as well. The assets could be more improved as well, such as adding more dimension into the background with particles or creating more food types to the variation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lessons Learnt:</p>\n<p>I realized that there were many more small detailed aspects that I didn't notice when playing games. For example, the color of certain sprites seemed a bit different when they were viewed on the web with a white background which I only noticed after exporting. It also made me realize how important it is to create a loop experience from start to end so that the user can play with ease. All in all, it was a learning experience of how to imagine a small scenario and create that in a visual realm.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:49:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f2efd2417b2d2756c72d93346a1fdd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ybae"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
