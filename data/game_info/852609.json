Get across the map to capture enemy portals in order to score points, all while your abilities change as you traverse to different sections of the map. Defend, fight, evade, and capture.<br/></p>\n<p>BWR was developed by a small team of 8 over the Summer of 2022. Based off a minigame originally made in <em>Minecraft</em>, we wanted to make this game come to life and see how well it would work as a standalone. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Nicholas Perell \u2014 Product Owner &amp; Systems Programmer<br/>Robert Christensen\u00a0\u2014 UI &amp; Networking Programmer<br/>Alex Choate\u00a0\u2014 3D Prop, Environment, &amp; Animation\u00a0Artist<br/>Crystal Wong\u00a0\u2014 Concept, Character, &amp; VFX Artist<br/>Dan Waleik\u00a0\u2014 Level Designer<br/>Austin Burkett\u00a0\u2014 Sound Designer<br/>Alyssa Fabian\u00a0\u2014 Sound Designer<br/>Thomas Charlton\u00a0\u2014 Producer &amp; Scrum Master</p>\n<p>QA Team: Aaron Pastor, Liam Parrish, Tesla Sinclair, Cat Davey, &amp; Joe Tecce\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T21:37:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f46/f46570692c7fd50cfb5b528cd72a17e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NicholasPerell", "Larnio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
