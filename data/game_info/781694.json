Or crush their skull in at 200 meters per second? And don't you want to do this without anyone else tossing or ordering you around? Well, you're in luck!</p>\n<p>Control your metal ball with A and D to move left and right. Use W to jump. Pressing the left or right mouse button switches your polarity to north and south respectively.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hitting birds increases your score and restores part of your health, along with restoring your jump. The farther right you are in the game, the higher the score you get from hitting birds.\u00a0Continually hitting birds in the air creates a combo that increases the score you obtain. Landing resets this combo.</p>\n<p>Getting hit at full health\u00a0places your health to 0, and your jump is reset. If you get hit without full health, you die and restart. At death, your score is recorded. Spikes and the bottom lava are sources of damage.</p>\n<p>A leaderboard is in the game! Place your name and get the highest score you can! Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to VGComposer for the music.</p>\n<p>The text font is not by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T20:30:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/387/3878e560adae20e05ef7695111f6b086.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ThatANonoWord"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
