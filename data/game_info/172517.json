The aim of the game is simple, get all of the sheep into the correct pen. To Achieve this you must use your mouse to guide your sheep dog and herd the sheep to their destination.\u00a0Each pen displays the number and types of sheep that should be in it. Each dog has its own characteristics which affect its intimidation, size, speed and agility. The closer you are\u00a0to a sheep the harder it will try to get away. Use left click to bark and scare nearby sheep momentarily.\u00a0 In addition to keeping their distance from you, sheep desire to be close to other nearby sheep. (but not too close, sheep like their personal space too.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Animal Images - My Beautiful Wife<br/>Menu Music - gigawowski -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/menutown-music<br/>Background Music - hitctrl -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/fun-adventure</p><p>#1GAM Entry no. 11</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/454/45425b22691c1911f0c6470905583018.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Menacer20"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
