Find the cookie thief in the gritty guts of the city within the time limit and help our protagonists to find what they are looking for \u2013 if such a thing can ever be more than a dream in a noire setting. Player1 controls the hard boiled Cookie \u2013 he is the only one able to catch the thief but suffers from a limited point of view, wandering between the menacing building blocks of downtown. Player2 controls Cloud, who is too far away to catch the thief but can overview the whole city thanks to her drone.
