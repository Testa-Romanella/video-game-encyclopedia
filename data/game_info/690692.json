Your goal is to escape through the elevator at the bottom of the drilling station area. Above is a map of the game to help if you are ever stuck.</p>\n\n<p>This was a first time game jam for most of us. As you will see, the game is nowhere near complete. However, we still hope to get some feedback from everyone :).</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Tasks are indicated with a yellow glow, - HOLD E - to do the task.</p>\n<p>SHIFT -\u00a0 walk making the player quieter (the bug enemy reacts to sound) and slower.</p>\n<p>WASD/ARROW KEYS - Movement</p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK -\u00a0 Toggle Flashlight</p>\n<p>RIGHT CLICK - Throw glowstick to distract\u00a0 boss/bug enemy</p>\n\n<p>Time is running out for submission, and the game doesn't seem to be loading on the webpage for us. If you are still interested in playing our game, we have attached a zip file for windows.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Team M DiGiTAL</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer\u00a0- Gavin\u00a0\u00a0https://absolutelyradical.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Programmer, Tile Art, Level Design, Game Design-\u00a0Daniel\u00a0\u00a0https://velano.itch.io</p>\n<p>Programmer, Tile Art -\u00a0Liam https://itch.io/profile/oceandiamond22</p>\n<p>Tile Art, Character Design -\u00a0Micaella\u00a0@thenon_artist1724 &amp;\u00a0@langit_micaella on Instagram</p>\n<p>Tile Art, Character Design, Level Design - Tristin https://steamcommunity.com/id/NecolashVEVO/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:47:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc5719521566a579a61b61cac022e8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["velano"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
