Put him back at full confidence and maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 he can salvage his relationship and save Milk Chocolate for EVERYBODY! (This will probably make more sense after a play\u2026)</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>-[ ARROWS to Move | (Hold)SPACEBAR to eat ]</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUE</strong></p>\n<p>-After enough time has passed, there really is no chance of saving him\u2026</p>\n<p>-Huh. Looks like I forgot to add depth to the sprites.</p>\n<p><strong>FAVORITE MECHANICS DITCHED LAST MINUTE</strong></p>\n<p>-<strong>Voice Shake</strong>\u00a0As the man\u2019s confidence goes up and down, he comments on his mood and other random things. While this happens, there is an incredible screen shake (based on Volume spectrum) because this man is flippin\u2019 massive in comparison.(I wrote and recorded over a hundred lines of dialog for this haha oh man. )</p>\n<p>-<strong>Giant Finger</strong>\u00a0When you step out of the Brow Area, it triggers the man to say something like \u201cGOT THAT ITCH ON MY FACE AGAIN\u201d! After a couple seconds a massive finger slowly approaches the area to scratch the itch. If it hits you, game over.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Roll Over</strong>\u00a0This is a secondary move where Barbra rolls over and it\u2019s so adorable that the hair implodes. This move has a cool down so you can\u2019t spam.</p>\n<p>@Ratherjolly<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d3/3d3ce0dc0351ef1370f1a784fe0c9823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ratherjolly"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
