The theme for this year was <strong>Reversed</strong> and it took me ~113 hours to complete the game with a final size of 11848 bytes. Please, die finished in the 34th position of 160 participants.</p>\n<p>In typical platformers you have to avoid enemies, avoid pits, collect stuffs, stay alive as long as possible and be happy. <strong>Please, die</strong> is not the typical platformer. Things are kind of reversed here, so you have to help our little character with a very simple task: to die.</p>\n<p>Tested on Chrome and Firefox. Other browsers must work too but it hasn't been tested.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/776/776b9e90a2c8ccc807f1a97b5051eb67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["satanas82"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
