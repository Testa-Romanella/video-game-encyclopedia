As a group of civilians trapped under siege, you\u2019ll face the ordeal of surviving the invasion. Though you do not participate in the fighting, the castle\u2019s fate is in your hands.<br/><br/>Support the last soldiers standing against overwhelming enemy forces. Craft supplies and manage your resources during the day, and scavenge through the fallen city during the night. You must stand until the rescue comes!<h3>ENDURE THE SIEGE</h3>You must support the soldiers with weapons and provisions. The wounded and sick also demand your care. But your resources are limited. You must find ways to preserve food, and develop your infrastructure to use your supplies more effectively.<br/><br/><h3>SCAVENGE THE FALLEN CITY</h3>Take the risk of sneaking into the fallen city plundered by the invaders. Under the cover of the night, you can find precious resources, trade with scavengers and other low-lifes, and help the surviving citizens \u2013 or exploit them. But be careful, enemy patrols keep watching the streets. You\u2019re no warrior, so a fight is always the worst option. You must be smart to remain unseen... and alive.<br/><br/><h3>MAKE DECISIONS, FACE THE OUTCOME</h3>In a war like this, one dilemma might lead to another and no decision is clearly good or clearly bad. One person\u2019s survival may come at the cost of another\u2019s death, no matter if he\u2019s friend or family. Sacrifices must be made \u2013 with no guarantee they\u2019ll pay off. In these desperate circumstances, however, survival means more than just staying alive, as morale is paramount. When you have to choose between sustaining the soldiers\u2019 strength and taking care of your own survival, what will you sacrifice?<br/><br/><h3>YOUR BACK AGAINST THE WALL</h3>A messenger had cut through the enemy lines to bring back reinforcements, but it will take weeks before help arrives. You\u2019ll face hunger, wounds, diseases, and despair \u2013 but also the growing tensions between the civilians and the last defenders of the city. The soldiers won\u2019t hold for long without your support and if the defense falls, the invaders will have no mercy. The odds are against you \u2013 what will you do to survive?<br/><br/><h3>TELL YOUR OWN STORY</h3><strong>Gloria Victis: Siege</strong> is developed on a game editor platform we created with the goal of sharing it with the modding community along with the game itself \u2013 at the release if possible, or later as a free DLC. It will allow you to create new scenarios for the game from scratch and expand the universe of Gloria Victis with your own unique ideas and stories!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-26T14:55:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/455/45550e55d57e629d27abcd02193fc6d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 565, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 361, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FishTankStudio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Black Eye Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
