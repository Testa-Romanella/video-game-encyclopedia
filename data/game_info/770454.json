It's only the tactics which differ.<br/><strong>Defend your base</strong> by spawning normal or heavy attack entities. Increase your income by <strong>spawning collectors</strong>. For every loop they do and every package they drop, they gain more points with every run - so try to defend your collectors with a high loop count.</p>\n<p>Also be aware of collisions: Spawning\u00a0 a lot of collectors could it make difficult to get though the enemy base when spawing attacking units.
