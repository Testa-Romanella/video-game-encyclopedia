Using the various parts of the bongos, remember and repeat the sequence of numbers and sounds shown to you by the lock to open it. Making mistakes in the sequence will raise a detection bar that will end the game once it becomes full. Get through as many locks as you can to get the highest score possible. Made to be used with alternate controls (bongo controller set). Can be played using the following keyboard controls:</p>\n<p>SPACE = START</p>\n<p>Q = top left bongo</p>\n<p>W = top right bongo</p>\n<p>A = bottom left bongo</p>\n<p>S = bottom right bongo</p>\n<p>Created by:\r\n</p>\n<p>Dillon Drummond - Programmer</p>\n<p>Madeline Kane - Lead Artist</p>\n<p>Andrew Gerrain - Producer</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter McCabe\u00a0- Designer</p>\n<p>Isaac Hessel-Robinson\u00a0- Designer</p>\n<p>Ava Udelson - Lead Sound Designer\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T07:11:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/129/12921b6e0f545de172fde9a74f6e5078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madeline.kane"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
