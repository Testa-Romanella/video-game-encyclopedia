The year is 2019. On your way you come across things that the exploring drones before you missed by a long shot. Determined to find the secrets of the Sirena Deep, you descend further into the depths. A glowing aura of something sinister grows ever near. On your way you seem to come across old stone tablets, which you don\u2019t know if they are made by humans or something else.\u00a0Arriving at the bottom, you see what you can only identify as a beautiful, sunken city.<br/></p>\n\r\nGame Mechanics\r\n<p>- Submarine Movement<br/></p>\n<p>- Cockpit Camera</p>\n<p>- Boost</p>\n<p>- Item Hooks</p>\n<p>- Immersive Sounds</p>\n<p>In Sirena Deep you will experience numerous mechanics with a cockpit that comes to life.
