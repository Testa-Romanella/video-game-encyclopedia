Too close to earth, his path past this forsaken planet is quite literally rocky - asteroids, space junk and human satellites alike litter his path home. To make things worse, the device he\u2019s carrying is fragile and may very well break upon impact with obstacles, which would inevitably suck him into a black hole, never to be seen again. Will you help Antin survive his dilemma?<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS:<br/><br/>Artists:<br/>Annemarie Ollendorf<br/>Alina R\u00f6\u00dfner<br/>Lara Teegen<br/>Anou Lange</p>\n<p>Programmer:<br/>Konstantin Schubert<br/>Kevin Holst<br/></p>\n<p>Music &amp; Sounds:<br/>Paul Gleitsmann</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T02:50:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/fadccb1b2a34128467f88d147149295e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Vyntha", "elconstie", "Anema"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
