You and four other players will play a sequence of short scenes divided into different life chapters. Each chapter views common experiences any boy or man could have at that time in their life, and which many boys and men often do experience. This scenario explores physical contact between boys and between men explicitly, and asks players to reflect on how that informs their own relationships, and visa versa. The final chapters offer an alternative to the masculinity we\u2019ve come to know.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Though <em>At Arm\u2019s-Length</em> is a game about boys and men, it is not intended to be exclusively for boys and men only. Players of any gender are welcome and encouraged to play.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>At Arm's-Length</em>\u00a0was written for the Golden Cobra Challenge 2017, and will be available for free in that anthology soon.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Practical: 5 players, 2 hours, some movement required, no materials required.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2849817fefa639cb71ef398c9aa467.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Act Apart"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
