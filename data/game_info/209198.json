Premise is simple, you create animals in up to 4-player local co-op and race them on various planets. We had to develop with various restraints. For example we could only use colours from 2 colour gradients. The game supports Xbox 360 controllers for playing past 1 player and updates its planets information directly from\u00a0Nasa's Exoplanet archive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/282/2826f59b55731c8cdb9a3cda63200ea1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Superfluous Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
