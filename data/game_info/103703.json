When they help bring in a mermaid, the beauty and mystery of the creature instantly captivates them. The two struggle with their feelings and soon a big choice has to be made.</p><p>Caught by a Lure is a short Visual Novel created by MakioKuta and Racheal in a month for the 2016 ILUjam. As such, it's a game centered around romance, though I make fair warning that it's not the happiest of romances. The line at the start of the summary was the theme I wished to explore with it. The game features four different endings, each more <em>cheerful</em> then the last.</p><p>Originally we had planned for the story to have two main routes, one told from the researcher's POV and the other through the mermaid's. Unfortunately, time didn't allow us that luxury. We'll update the game at a later date with the other side, but for now you can only view the story through the researcher's eyes.</p><p>We were running REALLY close to the deadline of the jam, so the game is not as tested as the things we typically like to release! So if you see any typos, please let us know in the comments section below. Also, due to the lack of time, the backgrounds in the game are sketches for the most part. They are sketches with pretty colours - but I hope they don't detract from the game!</p><p>I know this may be a bit of a different spin on the romantic theme for the jam, but I hope people enjoy it.</p><p>Thanks for playing! &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18d/18d368a6c4651e0eff9260109cf9a9ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MakioKuta", "Racheal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
