All your years you have heard tell of the Forest and all the treasures and dangers it holds within. All of these tales agree on a single thing -- the Forest is a wondrous place. Somewhere within the Forest, deep in its most enchanted groves, lies its heart: the Wishing Tree. The people in your village tell of those who have ventured into the Forest to find the Wishing Tree, seeking to have their heart\u2019s desire granted by the unicorns who guard the Forest, singing of its wonders. You harbor your own secret wish. Although you have tried to ignore it, to remind yourself that it is foolhardy to make such a journey, you can no longer resist. You must have your wish granted. <strong>And so, you must venture deep into the Forest, find the Wishing Tree, and await a unicorn beneath it...</strong></p>\n<p>Beneath the Wishing Tree is a dreamy, introspective tarot game for one themed around wishes and the lengths we will go to to have them granted.
