Eliminate the aliens and save your species. <br/><br/>This game adds modern controls to retro gameplay, allowing you to shoot at any forward angle. You can aim diagonally at enemies. Other shoot-'em-ups just let you slide horizontally and shoot vertically.<br/><br/>Your ship is equipped with 3-round burst fire by default. After you turn to aim at an enemy, you can fire a burst of 3 laser beams as your ship rotates back to straight. This allows the player to shoot arcs of laser beams and spray-'n-pray. With the right rhythm, you can practically have automatic fire. A skilled player can also collect the Automatic power up for truly full-auto fire!<h3>3D Graphics, Retro Gameplay</h3><ul><li>3D models, not pixelated 2D images<br/></li><li>Real-time dynamic lighting<br/></li><li>Realistic explosions with particles and smoke</li></ul><h3>Better Controls</h3><ul><li>Rotate your ship<br/></li><li>Shoot at any angle<br/></li><li>Unleash arcs of 3-round burst fire</li></ul><h3>Sick Soundtrack</h3><ul><li>Our 80's-style synthwave soundtrack will get you in the zone.</li></ul><h3>Save your game</h3><ul><li>We automatically saves your game at the start of each level.
