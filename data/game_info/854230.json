You play as a child who stays home alone for the first time.<br/></p>\n<p>This is literally the first game I make, and it is remotely inspired by events I remember experiencing as a child. I hope in the future to be able to create better works, and I would very much appreciate a feedback on this little project of mine. I'm thinking about adding more alternative endings. I am still struggling with Ren'py but when I will be\u00a0able I'll try to make the game more animated. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T16:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/776/7768932f038aabf8cddec2432507b571.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Rapidroll"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
