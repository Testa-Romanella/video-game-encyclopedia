Stay alert, be vigilant, and your survival is almost guaranteed.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Project Den Mother is a point-and-click adventure\u00a0made for the Space Bunny Jam. It is my first project created for Unity, built using Adventure Creator, as well as a learning project for 3D modeling. The first week was learning Blender and Unity enough to create an efficient workflow. The second week was developing the game itself.</p>\n<p>This is a rough prototype. There are no finished assets.\u00a0<strong>Do not save/load</strong> as you will break the game. I suggest not binding a key to \"skip cutscene\"\u00a0as you'll likely break the game.
