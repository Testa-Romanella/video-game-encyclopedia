Travel through stars, shoot down enemies, and test your skills as you journey across the galaxy to hyper-jump back home. Use <strong>arrow keys</strong> to move your spaceship and <strong>spacebar</strong> to shoot at attacking enemies and a final boss.</p>\n<p>Created by <strong>Sarah Ensminger </strong>(Game Producer and Gameplay Programmer), <strong>Tony Nammathao</strong> (Reviewer, Level Designer, Tester, Game Editor &amp; Conception Artist), <strong>Ke Ding</strong> (General Affairs, Backup Worker), <strong>Kenji Takahashi</strong> (Resource Finder)</p>\n<p>The majority of the game and the concept stayed the same, shooting the enemies and them shooting back with powerups throughout levels went right. The overall look of the game and gameplay experience worked better than we thought. We wanted to create a powerup to change the player spaceship but could not figure out how. Instead, we decided to add a shield powerup that blocks the enemy bullets. We also made the game horizontal to make it look cleaner instead of vertical and added the negative 5 when the player gets hit to create clarity for the player.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T18:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c67/c67d3cb3352081648090d71e5702a098.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["sarahensminger"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
