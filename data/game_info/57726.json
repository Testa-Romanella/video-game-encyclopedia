{"id": 57726, "slug": "ridge-racer-revolution", "name": "Ridge Racer Revolution", "name_original": "Ridge Racer Revolution", "description": "<p>Ridge Racer Revolution is an arcade racing game developed and published by Namco for the PlayStation in 1995. It is the PlayStation sequel of Ridge Racer (the arcade sequel is Ridge Racer 2). Like the original Ridge Racer, the player races computer-controlled cars with the objective of winning a series of races, and supports Namco's NeGcon controller. Ridge Racer Revolution adds two hidden cars, and two-player support via the PlayStation Link cable, and took roughly the same time to develop as the first. The intention was to increase the depth and add features.</p>\n<p>The game borrows most of its soundtrack from Ridge Racer 2. Ridge Racer Revolution was re-released in Japan for the PlayStation The Best range in June 1997, and for the Platinum Range in PAL regions the following year. The game received generally positive reviews, although some criticised its similarity to the original. Ridge Racer Revolution was followed by a sequel, Rage Racer, in 1996.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-28T12:02:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b5/5b5c86c04dc83fec9b5bd8c28e75b531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.44, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 16, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["NAMCO"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Namco"], "esrb_rating": null}
