Unfortunately the ship is hit by a meteorite that wipes out the other crew, leaving only you and the mobility challenged Quub tourists to fend for yourself.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the ship can't be piloted. Luckily moving around inside the ship will cause it to tilt from one side to the other, so maybe there's some time to save a few innocent paying customers...</p><p>The meteorite buddies of the first space rock are fast approaching. How many Quubs can you save in the swaying ship before your inevitable demise?</p>\n<p>Made in a hurry with L\u00d6VE and bump.lua\u00a0for the GMTK Game Jam 2020.</p>\n<p>Graphics from Kenney Game Assets.</p>\n<p>Thanks to play testers and support personel.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to borb for tips, ideas and rubber ducking.</p>\n<p>(On Linux you can download the alus.love file and run it using the <em>love</em> executable.
