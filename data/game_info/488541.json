You're given a randomized backstory and party with a small handful of supplies. Then you are tasked with walking across the dangerous landscape in hopes of reaching city hall, where you may be able to learn what exactly happened to the world you once knew.<br/><br/>This game is in it's beta form. I'm hoping for feedback and comments. The game play is set in stone, but the range of events and obstacles need to be fleshed out.(And of course any bugs will need to be squashed)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T04:41:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4d/e4d227feb07f28cafbb131a29b8f8377.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HelperWesley"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
