The 2020 theme was \u201cReturning From The Brink\u201d.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease play the game in full screen (the small icon on the bottom right of the window).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mandy J Watson (@mandyjwatson):<br/>Game design, narrative and writing, programming, audio, and art</li>\n<li>Fonts:<br/>Alike Angular by Sveta Sebyakina, Alexei Vanyashin, and Cyreal (Open Font Licence);<br/>Nevis by Ten By Twenty (Open Font Licence); and<br/>Nothing You Could Do by Kimberly Geswein (Open Font Licence)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Software Used:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Audacity</em>, Base64.Guru, <em>Bfxr</em>, <em>ChipTone</em>, <em>GIMP</em>, <em>Notepad</em>, and <em>Twine</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Game Notes:</strong><br/>There are a few small areas that hold the promise of something but nothing actually occurs. Had I had more time I would have fleshed them out further. You can probably get a sense of what I had intended to do with them.<br/><br/>The ending was the first part I wrote. It might appear that it was the last part that I wrote but that is not the case.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Technical Notes:</strong><br/>The only third-party assets I used in this game were the fonts.<br/><br/>The audio consists of base samples I created in <em>Bfxr</em> and <em>ChipTone</em>, as well as raw audio samples I recorded myself, all of which was edited in <em>Audacity</em>.<br/><br/>I created all the graphics. The shape's colour blocks change with every runthrough. It's randomised. This wasn't necessary, of course, but it's a little touch that makes me happy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T06:01:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9c1b33dc3ce863decebbdfab080704c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mandy J Watson"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
