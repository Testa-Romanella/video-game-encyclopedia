This game tests the players' focus and ability to multitask, as they have to fire and dodge bullets at the same time.</p><p>You play as a space combatant, and you have to eliminate the opponent while trying to avoid getting hit by bullets yourself. However, this 'Space' works in interesting ways.. and what would happen if two bullets hit each other..?</p><p>This game was made during the Global Game Jam 2017 in KDU University College.<br/></p><strong>Platform</strong>Windows PC<strong>Engine</strong>Unity<strong>Language</strong>C#<strong>Duration</strong>48 hours<strong>Completion</strong>2017<strong>Team Size</strong>3<strong>Role</strong>Programmer<p>We were more comfortable working as a team, as we were going with the same team that made Ping. We tried implementing more advanced mechanics, such as using the sine wave to calculate the trajectory of the bullets. It was a very smooth sailing project and we had quite a bit of extra time to polish up the game.</p>\n\n<p>More Projects by Ho Weng Yew</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b23/b2343650f6ce9f05d1cf699e5a3ad4b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ho Weng Yew"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
