It uses local weather data to simulate the weather conditions where you are.<br/><br/>You're locked out of your house in an odd, peaceful landscape with your trusty pooch. Interact with a dozen NPC's whose moods change with the weather. <br/>Jump off a roof. Kick a rock. Run through flowers. Be outside! <br/><br/>\"The vibrantly colored world of Lovely Weather We're Having doesn't take you back to a specific time necessarily, but to a mind set, when the world seemed bigger and brighter and more mystifying.\"<br/>-Jess Joho, Kill Screen <br/><br/>\"Lovely Weather is a clever little mood stimulator on the contemplative end of the scale, a kind of dynamic Zen box. You open it and poke around a little and maybe close it, thinking \u201cIs that all?\u201d<br/>And then you come back, and the weather\u2019s different, and the time of day\u2019s just so, and it takes your breath away.\"<br/>-Matt Peckham, WIRED<br/><br/>\"it looks gentle and colourful and weathery which is rather appealing as I\u2019ve had a nice morning of typing and listening to the rain fall outside.\"<br/>-Philippa Warr, Rock Paper Shotgun<br/><br/>\"Watched the trailer and I have no idea what the game is about.\"<br/>-Someone on reddit<br/><br/><strong>SOME FEATURES:</strong><br/><ul><li>Responds to local weather data, simulates actually being outside.<br/></li><li>Pleasant sounds, colors, and visuals that I hope you like.
