The rooms show sarcophagi, chests, pillars, statues, stairs, and secret passages, of course!</p>\n<p>Is this an accurate map or just something to fool thieves and tomb robbers? No one knows for sure but seems this place hides many traps and natural hazards on its cavernous tunnels and chambers!</p>\n<p>First, the adventurers need to climb the tower, an ancient stone building constructed on the foothills of a forgotten wasteland.</p>\n<p>Then, using an old iron chain that can be found on the tower's top, they need to descend through a dark shaft to reach the tower's dungeon.</p>\n<p>However, the bottom of the pit is filled with murky water. Who knows what lurks on its depths!</p>\n<p>You can use Lone Tower map\u00a0with\u00a0Old Kingdom, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or any other OSR TTRPG of your choice. Just print and play the files and start adventuring!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T05:13:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d47/d4735cf7d92551270e1bb803d8a1d9cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Horoscope Zine"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
