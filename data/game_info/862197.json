Cook with your grandma, help set up decorations with your cousins, and get your uncle into his costume! This game was made to reflect the chaos we've experienced setting up parties with our families. We hope you enjoy :)</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>Click and drag to cook and combine ingredients. Click to chop vegetables. <strong>Click to open cabinet and fridge doors!</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Choose where the decorations go by clicking either choice.</em></p>\n<p><em>Click and drag the zipper and button of the costume.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes, the zipper will seem like it will never zip. Keep going!! Eventually, it'll work and your aunt will thank you. You can also restart and try again, but this time go slower! You don't want to pinch your uncle.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong>:</p>\n<p>Sam Ortiz - Narrative Designer, Writer</p>\n<p>Jam Camera - Programming</p>\n<p>Brent Oakes - Programming</p>\n<p>cam\u00a0- Programming\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isaac Schutz - Composer</p>\n<p>Felipe Velay Ferreira - Composer, Sound Design</p>\n<p>toto lin - Background Art</p>\n<p>Roscoe- Character Artist</p>\n<p>Gabby Garcia\u00a0- Prop Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T12:07:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f24/f24550256047a3c9c563cb068e2d805f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sam", "jellolin", "cmrnprry", "Brenteldorf", "Uraziel", "fferreir", "ahrtxv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
