Push your polygons to the limit in some beautifully rendered 3D physics based racing. There's a single vehicle currently available which can be driven around 3 unique race tracks. You'll go up against 4-10 AI racers depending on which track you're on, and they'll all be fighting you for 1st place.</p>\n<p>To tie into the Score Space rules, the game does indeed have a global leaderboard for the fastest track times for each course. You'll race around 3 laps on each course to get your final time. The fastest times will be updated live for all to see in-game. Only the top 3 times for each course are recorded and if someone beats someone else, their name and time is replaced with the new fastest.</p>\n<p>See how quickly you can dash around the various courses, pick a favourite and learn the short-cuts to try and be the fastest. Beware of hitting other racers and scenery as they can result in some undesirable delays to your lap times, as you can imagine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:52:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a89/a891cc338bbb774e0ed933e5caf0fd96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danstarr13"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
