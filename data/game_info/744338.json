It's not good, it's not scary, but damn is it fun to laugh at.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the game itself, you play as police officer Pat, an overweight cop who has to atone for past crimes to save himself and others (a whole one others) from a demon chef.</p>\n<p>P.S. After the game asks you to save I strongly suggest not only that you do so but also immediately move or the game will spawn kill you. (because I guess it was too much to ask of past me to put the demon a space up, which I won't fix now because I want you to experience the unaltered travesty that is this game.)</p>\n<p>Also this is technically a spoiler so if you want to experience the age old tradition of running around clicking on everyone object on the map skip this, but after you \"escape\" the demon chef you need to pick up a water bottle from the shelf in the kitchen and put out the fireplace with it to progress.</p>\n<p>Also also, this game is very broken and you can sometimes go back to an area you've been to before you weren't supposed to go back to, nothing game breaking as far as I could find so you should be able to progress without restarting, just backtrack your steps and you'll be fine. (although it would be funny if someone found a way to break the game completely, let me know if you do that would be hilarious, not that anyone would want to play this more than once)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T07:30:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faf/fafdea0466603ff59df1191b6fe6ad18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garry Found"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
