They sing their songs as they roam around their territories hunting pesky gophers with skills unique to each of them. After years of living together they've learned to recognize one another's songs and now only hunt together! The goal of the game is to make sure Kylie &amp; Badjo both get fed.</p>\n<ul><li>Victory is not implemented, but if you get both animal's food bars to green give yourself a pat on the back :)</li><li>Gophers require 2 hits to eat. Once to stun them, and another to eat them</li><li>There are multiple strategies for hunting well so play around!</li></ul>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Move:\u00a0</strong>W/D or Left/Right</li><li><strong>Action: </strong>Space<ul><li>Jump as Kylie</li><li>Slash as Badjo</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p>This game was made by the\u00a0<strong>5x Train</strong>\u00a0team for Global Game Jam 2022</p>\n<ul><li>Discord</li><li>Twitter</li></ul>\n<p>Train Crew:</p>\n<ul><li>Game Design &amp; Code:\u00a0PeachTreeOath</li><li>Art:\u00a0krevlee</li><li>Music:\u00a0Double Dragon\u00a0Bimmy</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T07:49:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b118631a6ef7f795acc00f454f881530.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PeachTreeOath"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
