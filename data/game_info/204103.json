Your car transmission's about to fail and you need to get the car to the mechanic's.

Click and hold on the foot pedals for brake and for gas, and use the knock-off cell phone to inevitably call for a tow. Don't hit bumps too hard, or you'll start to lose vital parts in your car.\u00a0There's currently no way to put the car in\u00a0reverse in the game, but we'll just blame that on\u00a0\u00a0your transmission problems for now...</p>\n<p>Get your car to the mechanic shop to \"win\" (i.e. not pay the towing fee).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f7/4f7ae4acdb2df7efcaa51ca5029d6592.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DavidsHeadGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
