Play melodies with your keyboard, and the nodes will answer, communicate with eachother, and progressively transform your music into something new.<p><strong>Instructions</strong> : <em>Left Click </em>: Select/Move node - <em>Right Click</em> : Create/Delete node - <em>Q,W,E,R,T,Y,U,I,O,P</em> : Give a melody to a node <em>Scroll wheel : </em>Zoom/Change node's octava<em> - Middle Click : </em>Lock node<em> - Double Click </em>: Activate node</p><p><strong>Advanced Controls</strong> : <c> : Change node's sound, <g> : Toggle scale editing, <m> : Toggle rhythm mode , <space> : Tap tempo (rhythm mode only), &lt;+/-&gt; : Set volume <d>Toggle node's memory display</d></space></m></g></c></p><p><em>, Left click drag on a node's range </em>: Change node's range</p>GETTING STARTED1. Basics<ul>\n<li>Select a node and play notes with Q,W,E,R,T,Y,I,U,O,P to teach it a melody</li> <li>When a node communicates, the inactive nodes in its range answer with a similar melody</li> <li>Create node chains and see what happens</li> <li>A locked node won't learn or forget anything from other nodes</li></ul>2. Tips<ul>\n<li>Every time a melody is played, it has a chance of mutating (by duplication, transposition, supression of notes or rythm scaling)</li> <li>Use locked nodes to keep melodies you like, or to set fixed patterns to vary over</li> <li>Old melodies wear : a recent melody is more likely to be selected for playing</li> <li>You can create multiple independent circuits by spacing them out</li> <li>A node won't trigger the node it was triggered by, unless it is the only choice possible.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02b/02b34f70c691fad753eedfb7d34ec4d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Cl\u00e9ment Duquesne"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
