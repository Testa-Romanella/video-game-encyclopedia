From the distant past, you can look into the future thanks to your magical crown and see that brave explorers want to loot the treasures you will be buried with. Guide them to the spike traps to kill them!</p><p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to select the direction in which you will place your magical arrows. Click on an empty tile to place the arrows pointing to the direction you selected. When an explorer steps on it, it will change its direction to match the one on the arrow, except if there is a wall. You can only have one arrow in each direction active, placing a new one will remove the existing one. Arrows will disappear when they have been stepped on 3 times.</p><p>Kill all explorers to complete the level, and don't let any of them get to your crypt on the right side of the screen!</p><p>CREDITS</p><p>=======</p><p>Game made by Rodrigo '@r2d2rigo' Diaz and Eduardo '@sodap_' Alonso for the Ludum Dare 36.</p><p>Thanks to Mechanical Boss @MechanicalBoss for providing the physical place for doing the jam!</p><p>Sound effects by:</p><p>Little Robot Sound Factory - http://www.littlerobotsoundfactory.com</p><p>Michel Baradari - http://www.apollo-music.de/</p><p>Music by:</p><p>CasePortman Musing - https://soundcloud.com/kc_portman/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8d/f8df34130faf85d21cde4831dfb310fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["r2d2rigo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
