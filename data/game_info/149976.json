You start with 1 truck collecting resources, one house, and the AA gun that you control. The levels start easy and increase in difficulty as you go. In between levels is the purchasing phase. Here, you can use the resources you've collected (points, wood, and ore) to purchase more trucks, buildings, and even tanks for reinforcements. Sometimes other buildings are required before you can purchase a particular building. The more items you have at the end of the level, the more bonus points you will collect. Try to build up your city and get the high score!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cf81d6d61486a3a8587cbbacb0d0bb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["haymanmarc"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
