He was curating an exhibition of street artists, heaps of artists, but only a small gallery. I wanted to show a bunch of the artists previous works, but without taking up space, so I made some virtual space.</p>\n<p>It's designed to be pretty janky, but also to fit with the vibes of the show. To make the experience a bit more interesting I created a custom controller with two track balls, one for looking and one for movement, and wow that's not easy to use!</p>\n<p>Art is not mine (I wish, I think there's some Ox King in there, it's all good stuff)\u00a0but the glitched out models and environment is all mine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T09:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/1475f000d27728a2c9004cc204de2f00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["barsk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
