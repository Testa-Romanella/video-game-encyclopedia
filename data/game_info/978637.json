Said NTR is fully avoidable based on how you play the battles. Other members of the party will try to grope the pair, luring them over to their side. Based on your positioning you can avoid this, but you'll be at a major disadvantage in the battles. NTR possibilities include three different men trying to win Gwenivier's affections, a female rival for Gwenivier obsessed with Carwyn, and a male to female transformation for Carwyn leading to him becoming the groups play thing.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main sexual themes of the game include netorare and gender bending. Both of which can be avoided depended on how you play the battles.

Joined by who he suspects might be the love of his life, they'll face obstacles and opponents that test that supposed love down to its core. Will Carwyn be able to overcome his doubts and fears? And will Gwenivier still be waiting for him when he does?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can play the game with all perspectives enabled, or hide Gwenivier's, only seeing her corruption through context and overheard snippets of conversations. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis version of Netoria Tactics has been enhanced with new art and features.
