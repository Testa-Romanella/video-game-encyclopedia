But your tools you're using to get the ball to the hole are very out of place. Use a brick or a hammer to shoot the ball, or you can even use balls, ramps or dominoes to achieve your goal.</p>\n<p>The game progresses as you complete more levels, you got to play with more and more weird stuff. At the start it's just regular billiards with a golf ball and a stick, but the next time there's a brick on the table. Later you can shoot with golf balls, and than you have ramps to get across obstacles.\u00a0From level 41 you can even play with dominoes.</p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\n<p>You can play polf by using just your mouse:</p>\n<ul><li>Click and drag on an object to shoot it</li><li>You can cancel the shooting by right clicking</li><li>You can navigate in the level selector with the mouse scrollwheel</li><li>You can move the camera with the scrollwheel, and move with the middle mouse button</li><li>Right click in your inventory to select an item and right click again to place it</li><li>You can rotate objects with the mouse scrollwheel</li></ul>\n<p>Keyboard controls:</p>\n<ul><li>In the level selector you can navigate with A/D ant the arrows</li><li>You can press R to restart the level</li><li>You can press Esc to exit a level, or go back to the title screen if you're in the level selection</li></ul>\r\nGame jam:\r\n<ul><li>This game was made for \"The Completion Jam\" hosted by Deynum</li><li>All code and art was made during the 72 hours</li></ul>\r\nSocial:\r\n<ul><li>Itch page:\u00a0https://vingames.itch.io/</li><li>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/DKpbVKk</li><li>Youtube:\u00a0https://youtube.com/channel/UCo-V8qAlHZWFRkUDCtc0cyQ</li><li>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/VinarkDev</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:10:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e697a67b817d5e4b03e9180fe9a0589.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Vinark117"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
