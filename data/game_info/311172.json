You all have heard rumors about the problems the kingdom was facing; heartless bandits assaulting travelers on the roads, terrible monsters ravaging villages and even the God Patriarch, Radaos, going missing from the Heavenly Peak...! But... Rhein, still, seemed to be bustling with much activity. <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Turning your head, you glanced at your companions, knowing the great adventure you were all longing for was about to begin...!\"</strong></p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>GeaSaga</strong> is a <em>somewhat</em> traditional role-playing game with some japanese and western influences. It shares the same setting as <em>Heroic Tale</em> and <em>Flesh</em>, my previous projects, but it focuses a bit more on worldbuilding elements rather than dungeons and is intentionally much more lighthearted in nature. My major focus is to (hopefully) create an uncomplicated but entertaining adventure getting a bit of help from the player's imagination.</p>\n<p>From the go, you get four characters respresenting some archetype in your team. You will explore and discover new areas, gather hints, complete tasks, find treasures and then move onto new and more exciting challenges. I'm trying not to put much emphasis on hand-holding and, although there's a proper ending and some over-arching plot, it's not heavy on narrative and you are not required, for the most part, to complete every single quest.</p>\n<p>Much of the inspiration behind this project came from the era of japanese home computers like <strong>PC-88</strong> or <strong>FM-7</strong> so, as a personal challenge and in order to make the game as unaccessible as possible, I decided to use <strong>RPG Maker 95</strong>, which is basically ANCIENT by today's standard but represents very well the spirit I was aiming for. This will probably put some people off and test way to much the patience of some players but, in many aspects, I'm working on ease the frustration that can originate from the clunkiness of the engine as much as I can.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u203b Game Characters \u203b</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>GLADIATOR</strong></li></ul>\n<strong>Weapon Style</strong>: Sword &amp; Shield<strong>Armor Type</strong>: Cloth, Leather, Chain<br/>The &lt;Gladiator&gt; is an all-around adventurer able to use many types of equipment.
