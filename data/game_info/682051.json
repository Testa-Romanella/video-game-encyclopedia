Investigating the crime scene will lead to finding evidence and information on the true nature of what happened to the missing officer, Jeremy Moore.</p>\n<p>I developed Delirium as part of my Game Engine Architecture module during my second year of studies at the University of Westminster. The final submission was to present a game prototype using Unreal Engine, making use of the visual scripting and blueprint tools included in the game engine. As it stands, Delirium is a working prototype in which I hope to develop further in the near future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It would be great to hear your feedback about Delirium!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T06:41:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d78b37a4fbd1d621b7530c8c9059f15a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AshleyZakEdwards"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
