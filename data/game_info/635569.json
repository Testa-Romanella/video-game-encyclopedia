This game lets you unleash 50, 100, 500 (or whatever your machine can handle)\u00a0individual Harolds at once into the world. They are then free to make their own experiences &amp; you can watch them evolve into better performing individuals, by reproduction, mutation &amp; speciation.\u00a0</li><li>Once you have successfully trained your own AI, you can play against it &amp; see, if it has reached a\u00a0superhuman level.\u00a0</li><li>This project will help you understand, how neuro-evolution works &amp; will provide you with interesting statistics &amp; graphics along the training-process.\u00a0</li><li>If you just want to relax, play Icy Tower &amp; enjoy the iconic music of the game - go for it.
