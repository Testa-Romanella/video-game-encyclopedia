In the naaame of looove...\u201d  Oh! Sorry, that\u2019s embarrassing but I love the \u201cBoopremes.\u201d See what I did there?  It\u2019s a pun. The name of the group is actually the Supremes.  Anyway, my name is Fantasia and I\u2019m a REALLY popular Ty Unicorn BEANIE BOO (not that I have a big head or anything.. Well, physically, I kind of do, and my eyes, yeah, those are big, too.)  Anyway, my agent said I need to tell you about this game and how our worlds are very relatable (accept we\u2019re adorable furry animals with attitude).<br/><br/>Me and my best friends Slush, Kiki and Coconut (other super rad Beanie Boos of course) just graduated university and we had no idea what to do in life.  I mean, who does? Sooo, with a coffee truck that my adopted mother Owlette gave me as a graduation gift, and the crippling anxiety of adulthood, we decided to go on a journey in search of the Beanie Babies from the 1990\u2019s\u2026  Right?!  Whatever happened to them?  Are they still alive?  Where do they live?  Ugh, so many questions!  <br/><br/>This is how it works.  After you beat super fun and addicting puzzle blast levels, you get a Ty coin.  Use the coin (or don\u2019t, and keep grinding) to unlock the story quests which will lead us all to the Beanie Babies (because we obviously NEED to know what happened to them).  Collect and get to know your favorite Boos who help you beat levels, join clubs with your friends, win free stuff (including physical PLUSH), keep playing levels, keep following our story and blah blah blah, you get the point.  Okay, have fun!  Oh and by the way, I\u2019m breaking through the fourth wall so you and I can continue this conversation.<br/><br/>Now where was I?  Oh yeah..<br/><br/>\u201cBefore you breaaak my hearrrrt\u2026\u201d  I\u2019m such a good singer.<br/><br/><br/>WHAT YOU GET:<br/><br/>CASUAL GAMEPLAY<br/>Really, really really easy to play, but it eventually gets challenging, trust us.<br/><br/>NEW GAME MODES<br/>Just when you think you have mastered a new type of puzzle...BLAST!
