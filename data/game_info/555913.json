Plus it was made by all of me (well youtube literally helped step by step but still). So I would like for you guys to enjoy the game<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls (you can only move up):\u00a0</strong>To move up in order to avoid the firey stick. You have a lot of options. I thought about how different people like different styles of playing,\u00a0so I made about 4 or maybe 3 controls.</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Space bar\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>2.</strong> Up arrow\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>3.</strong> Left Click\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>4.</strong> Touch</p>\n<p><strong>To start the game: </strong>In order to start the game at first, your gonna have to click anywhere with your mouse after the short message then click on the <em><strong>Play</strong></em> button, and then you will be in the game. Then use the controls above to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game! And remember, If you in any way use the name <strong><em>ProG </em></strong>which mind you, is a Neremia B studios trademark. You will end up in a 1.5 trillion dollar sue (I need money). And again, Enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:31:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef814967a913029d47824a971879e26f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jessermi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
