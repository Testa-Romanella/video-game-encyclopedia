Rather than moving the player object around each level, the player can directly tilt the entire stage, allowing for the player object to move. The player is tasked with completing each level as fast as possible, while collecting collectables to increase their overall score. This physics-based approach makes the game like a labyrinth tilt-maze game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Developed for CPI 211 Final Project assignment. Four students spent two months documenting and developing this game. We hope you enjoy what we have made!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T05:58:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a057bc426f7d3fef7961434813589c5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laifu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
