The source code of the game fits on a normal business card and is still readable. Keep in mind that this is just a concept \u2013 it should be possible to reduce the size of the source code <strong>a lot</strong> which would also increase the readability of the business card.</p>\n<p>In the game your quest is to kill a dragon. Therefore you must enter a dungeon and collect weapons, armour, magic scrolls and more so that you become strong enough to face the dragon. But before you can fight the mighty lizard you must solve a puzzle and deal with lots of goblins, orcs and other creatures. Luckily not everyone in the dungeon is your enemy: you will find some friendly merchants that can sell you useful items like healing potions or magic spells.</p>\n<p>If you cannot defeat the dragon you can still kill it by cutting the business card into little pieces. However this is not recommended since there is a kitten within the game.</p>\n<p>After defeating the dragon you should give the card \u2013 or send the link \u2013 to somebody else (at least if you didn\u2019t cut the card into pieces).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:27:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b2/8b2ce1c652c99da3fc0f1c336bc8a47c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelPaladin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
