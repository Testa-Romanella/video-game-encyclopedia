You choose your own image, and then try to unravel as much of it as you want without trapping the ball bouncing around. When you feel done, your progress is generated into a 3D level, and you get armed with a shotgun, ready to destroy the pictures trying to devour you. You have to be quick though - your flashlight battery is slowly running out!<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in just over two days for Ludum Dare 39.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb575a56332b8c2bb97c505c0db0270a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Philisophic Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
