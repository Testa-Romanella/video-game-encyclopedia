This is BOYZ: WORLD WIDE WEST!</p>\n<p>BOYZ WWW is a small contained Quick Draw experience with psuedo-multiplayer (?) elements. Create your very own BOY and post their code online so others can duel them in a quick draw in their own game! It's a very primitive form of multiplayer, but I'm pretty pleased with the end result. This is another barebones game, but it's not meant to be anything mind blowing. Regardless, I hope you have fun with it!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>JUST AN FYI! THE DOWNLOADABLE VERSION RUNS MUCH BETTER THAN THE IN BROWSER VERSION!</em></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>LIFE IN THE WORLD WIDE WEST - THE BASICS</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Z - Accept</p>\n<p>X - Decline</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Move</p>\n<p>BOYZ WWW can be played with a gamepad, though I doubt it makes much difference.</p>\n<p>You can play BOYZ WWW in browser if you want, but as a heads up, it runs considerably worse than the downloadable version!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BUILDA-BOY MODE</em></strong><br/>In BUILDA-BOY MODE, you can create your very own player character! These creatures are called BOYZ! You can customize them with a selection of 4 colors (Blue, Green, Red. Yellow), 25 hats and clothing options, 4 guns, 4 backdrops, and your choice of a 4 letter name! Don't let us stop you, BOYZ are traditionally named swear words!</p>\n<p>Once you're done, you'll find your very own WANTED POSTER, which can be customized further with a selection of taglines. Be sure to post your WANTED POSTER online with the tag #BOYZWWW so others can find it and use it!\u00a0(I'm trying to do a thing here, your help is greatly appreciated.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>ARCADE MODE</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Wanna test your skills before tackling the WORLD WIDE WEST? Too lazy to type a code? Just wanna look at the reptile people? You've come to the right place! ARCADE pits you against 4 opponents in succession, each getting harder as you go along. These 4 rapscallions are known as \"THE BULLY BANDITS\", criminals who terrorize BOYZ who can't defend themselves. If only there was a brave hero who could come teach them what for!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>WORLD WIDE WEST MODE</em></strong></p>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, the title feature: WORLD WIDE WEST! This is where the magic happens. Upon entering the mode, you'll be prompted to give a code to the BOUNTY BOY! Upon entering that code, you'll be set against an enemy BAD BOY who you duel to the death in a quick draw duel! Where do you get these codes? From others all around the world (hopefully) of course! Find WANTED POSTERS online by searching through the tag #BOYZWWW (ideally) and duel with other BOYZ from all over!</p>\n<p>Can't find codes? Don't worry, you can type ANY code into the code selection and it will generate a BOY for you to battle! Isn't that neat?</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy your time in the WORLD WIDE WEST, happy shootin'!</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you like the game (or feel sorry for me) and have some spare change you can throw my way, please consider donating to my Ko-fi! I make money exclusively through commissions right now so any and all help is greatly appreciated! Be sure to leave a small request and I'll do a small sketch for you :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T09:02:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/32855eba3539dee628d7a099090d64e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Bahamutgreen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
