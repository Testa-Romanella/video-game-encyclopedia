A Battle Royal mode to finally know who is the best between you and your friends and a Prop Hunt mode to discover or rediscover the best of the caches. <strong>So far, only the Battle Royal works. You may select PropHunt in game but that will lead you to an empty map used for test.</strong><br/><br/>Choose the skin that suits you best and invite your friends online! <br/><br/><br/>The health crisis of covid-19 has shown us the importance of social links. The rise of multiplayer party games (Fall Guys, Among us, ... to name a few) has also shown that even if it was not always possible to see each other in person, multiplayer games were an opportunity to get together. The medium is only there to trigger funny or impressive situations on which players can bounce.  <br/><br/>However, the genre is sorely lacking in shooting games. Here, <strong>We Were Friends</strong> brings together two of the most popular game modes of the moment to allow players to choose the atmosphere of their games!<br/><br/>Battle Royal mode : <br/>Start this mode when at least two player are on the server. (Take care that the second player is set as \"ready\" in his status section (he must have clicked on \"OK\" when choosing his avatar)<br/><br/>Once players are all ready, the host have to start the game. That will teleport all the players in another map. There you will have a few seconds to wait (it's a security to allow all players in the lobby to join the new map). After 10 secondes, all players will be teleported to a spaceship. Then, all you have to do is jump from the spaceship, find a weapon and be the last standing. A safezone will reduce the map area though the game and water deals TONS of damage so be sure to avoid it. If you get killed by a player, you'll spectate him.<br/><br/>In the game, you may find Gravity guns, rail guns, assaultRifle, pistol, ... <br/><br/><br/>Prop Hunt Mode : <br/>So far the mode ISN'T IN THE GAME.
