If a blockage develops between a patient\u2019s appendix and intestine, he or she will likely face severe pain as well as vomiting and possibly fever. When this is the case, it is necessary to act quickly because if the appendix ruptures, the patient could experience internal infections that can be fatal. During this interactive surgery you will learn about the advantages of doing the procedure laparoscopically and the instruments used to prevent the need for a large incision.
