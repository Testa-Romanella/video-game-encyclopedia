If you have any issues, leave a comment below or on the Ludum Dare submission page and I will look into it.</p>\n<p>This was developed solo over 72 hours (and it really felt like 72 hours). All art and sound was developed by me over the weekend, I used the 2d platformer microgame from Unity as a starting point for player movement and their event system, but otherwise developed all the mechanics on top of that myself during the time period.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A, D: movement</li><li>Space: Jump (in looooooow gravity)</li><li>Left click: Interact</li><li>Right click: Super secret mechanic you'll have to play the game to learn about.</li><li>E: Consume health potion (there is a known bug with the health potion UI not showing up, if you get stuck at the end of the level try mashing E).</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Health potion UI bug (see above)</li><li>Unable to jump when up against a wall - just jump without trying to move at the same time and you'll be allowed to jump. Desperately wanted to fix this one but my brain is dead.</li><li>Clipping into doors - just try to not run into the door when it's closing.\u00a0Unfortunately there's no warning when this happens, so err, good luck!</li><li>Door doesn't open second time - the animation doesn't play but you can still walk through it.</li><li>Floating into the sky at the end of the level - is it a bug? Is it a feature? Who knows</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:34:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/990148a2ad19b7716731da3d8d3d8ba9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["itsonrandom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
