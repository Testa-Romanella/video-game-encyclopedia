Players are let loose in an arbitrarily expanding grid of 3d models, unexplained fireworks, player control logic, free music, circling cars, reflective water, and explosions. Nothing quite fits together or does what it\u2019s supposed to, but everything does something, and carries the name of the user who made it. The project aims, with mixed success, to also explore what it\u2019s like to live mediated by by various digital platforms and means of exchange (beyond games web frameworks, social networks, etc.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff507170d47a619d161962ce8e8393cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["qfwfq"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
