He has taken it upon himself to return mankind to the old ways of blood and steel.</p>\n<p>Using his advanced technology, g0l1ath has captured the greatest warriors from across history and transported them through time to his secret lair in space and stored them in vats. A select few managed to break out.</p>\n<p>Now these strangers must learn to work together to defeat this new threat...</p>\n<p>Submission for InspireJam, inspired by the 1988 arcade game Gain Ground.</p>\n<p>In the original, players had to reach an exit point with at least one character or destroy all enemies on the level before time runs out. An integral element of Gain Ground is the hostage mechanic as an approach to a lives system; if you complete a level or exit with a character while carrying a hostage, you can use that character in subsequent levels.<br/></p>\n<p>Our interpretation of the modifiers:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>\u201cStranger in a strange land\u201d</strong> - Play as warriors from across time teleported to the far future.</li><li><strong>\"Touch Grass\"</strong> - Inspired by David and Goliath, use modest weapons of your age to take down a powerful foe.</li><li><strong>\"Invert Your Expectations\" </strong>- Based on the arcade game Gain Ground, but instead of warriors from the future in a historical simulation, play as warriors from the past fighting the enemies of the future.</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Maxwell Koo - Programming, Enemy Design, AI, UI</li><li>Charles Zawacki - Programming, Player Design, Map Design, Game Balance \r\ncharles.zawackis.com</li><li>Morph - Character sprites and animations</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the creators of the following assets:</p>\n<p># Sprites and effects</p>\n<p>https://trevor-pupkin.itch.io/tech-dungeon-roguelite (Paid)<br/></p>\n<p>https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-robot-tileset</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/particle-pack</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/board-game-icons</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/game-icons</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/handcuffs-0</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/explosion-7</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/free-keyboard-and-controllers-prompts-pack</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/space-9</p>\n<p>https://github.com/PlayWithFurcifer/godot-particle-systems-guide<br/></p>\n\n<p># Fonts</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts</p>\n<p># Code</p>\n<p>https://github.com/vnen/godot-tiled-importer</p>\n\n<p>Used with modifications under the MIT license</p>\n<p>https://github.com/kagenash1/godot-behavior-tree</p>\n\n<p># Sounds</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/sci-fi-sounds</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/interface-sounds</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Natty23/sounds/349182/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Dundalkkirk/sounds/565884/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/montblanccandies/sounds/266280/ CC-BY Rindre Rindere (http://pakilusin.co.vu/)</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/gristi/sounds/562191/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/nioczkus/sounds/396331/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/fennelliott/sounds/347647/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/pbimal/sounds/534523/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/MrFossy/sounds/547202/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/micahlg/sounds/413184/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/mrickey13/sounds/515624/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/SypherZent/sounds/420668/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/HighPixel/sounds/577029/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/spookymodem/sounds/249813/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/nettimato/sounds/350349/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/johnnypanic/sounds/36281/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/MATRIXXX_/sounds/402766/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/pepingrillin/sounds/252083/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/plasterbrain/sounds/351807/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/vacuumfan7072/sounds/396032/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/apinasaundi/sounds/405648/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/MATRIXXX_/sounds/441500/</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/50-cc0-sci-fi-sfx</p>\n<p>https://patrickdearteaga.com/chiptune-8-bit-retro/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:59:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10d/10d738d2934b870ffedb98ac446313d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mjkoo"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
