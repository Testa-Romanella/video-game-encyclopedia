Your spaceship has suffered a failure just after  launch and you\u2019re heading away from the solar system and into deep  space. Why not go deeper?\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A clicker game with deep real-world astronomical data.\r\n</li><li>You start off moving at about the escape velocity of Earth.\r\n</li><li>Click the warning button to increase your velocity (km/s) as you rocket into deep space.\r\n</li><li>Yep, keep clicking. That\u2019s what a clicker is.\r\n</li><li>Watch as the lights of planets and stars begin to move faster in the background.\r\n</li><li>Use your star chart to track how far you get based on real distances from the Sun to various space objects.\r\n</li><li>(NOT IN ALPHA VERSION) Use spare parts once you get far enough out to increase your velocity even further.\r\n</li><li>Go as far as Saturn is from the Sun to get an autoclicker.\r\n</li><li>Should take less than a minute or so to start going faster than the speed of light.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This is a Jam entry though I worked alone on this project. I added some simple sounds and procedurally generated music.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Music generated using (http://infinibeats.com/), a website allowing quick procedural music creation. Settings are all my own.\r\n</li><li>Sound effects made in sfxr (http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)\r\n</li><li>Custom fonts (where used) are free Google fonts, included in the source code (https://fonts.google.com/)\r\n</li><li>Art for game studio splash screen is from one of my older games.\r\n</li><li>Programmed in Godot game engine 3.</li></ul><p>Known issues:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Star chart scroll doesn\u2019t keep place correctly\u2013scroll to bottom and hit another milestone to reset.\r\n</li><li>Parts not implemented. Instead, get parts and autoclicker from a few milestones.\r\n</li><li>Dialog boxes are modal\u2013this works as intended.\r\n</li><li>Breaking the speed of light\u2013this works as intended.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Next version:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Notation when you pass the speed of light (about 300000 km/s)\r\n</li><li>That dang parts system. Purchase parts to go faster.
