With quantum gates as his only ability to navigate the counterintuitive quantum world, he is on a mission to collect keys that some say lead to a realm no longer affected by the laws of quantum and classical physics. This lore - long since forgotten by the masses of human civilization -- comes from an ancient alien culture that refers to this realm as The Ultimate Observatory. A mystical place where the small is no longer small, a place from where the sole occupant can observe every particle in all the universes at once without affecting them and thus being of a truly omnipotent existence and having ultimate knowledge and power.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T05:56:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e3/6e360c32c0202acf1557fdbe9309dfd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vvenomssnake"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
