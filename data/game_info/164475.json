In this game, you play as the black pieces fending off the horde of white pieces who crawl across the map in an effort to put your King piece in a \"checkmate.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game essentially comes with 4 different levels for each season; each offering a little something different. This game is pretty standard for Tower Defense Games; it is my first official game that I made not for a class project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would love feedback or advice on where else I can take this game. I have a couple of ideas for stuff I'd like to add but not enough programming knowledge. If you have an idea of something to add to the game, please atleast link me a site or video where I can atleast learn how to do what you want me to put into practice.</p>\n<p>Other than that, I hope you like the game!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f2/9f2206c4ec43a4f105b24cd59bed6300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MisterPassenger"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
