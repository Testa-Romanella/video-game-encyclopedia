Make your guild a focus of world attention.<h3>PvE</h3>Fighting ancient creatures and beasts will allow you to gain not only sufficient EXP but also all the materials needed to build your equipment. Remember not to challenge the Bosses alone, team up to defeat them and you will become the savior.<h3>Business Empire</h3>It's a fully player-controlled economic system, even free players can earn crystals to exchange for gold coins. It's a free economic system, but be careful of being attacked by other players while gaining revenue, as thugs in danger areas are spying on you in the dark.<h3>The Great Land</h3>It's a customizable continent system for hardcore players, where you can create a continent of your own, grow crops and dig new resources on it.
