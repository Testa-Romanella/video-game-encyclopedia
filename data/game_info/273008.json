Prescribe some herbs to people who require treatment and then click Finished to determine if you prescribed the correct herbs to cure them. If you have, these will be outlined in the herb book and then you just rinse and repeat until you have cured everyone correctly! Sacrifices must be made!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Simple click-and-point style game, you click on the book or files to open them. The herb book and the \"finished\" book, you click on either page to navigate between the different pages, and click anywhere outside of them to close them. The patient files you click on them to open, click on them to close. When a patient file is open, you can click on the herbs on the right to prescribe them to the patient. Be careful, once you prescribe a herb, you can't un-prescribe it! Once all the prescriptions are done, click the Finished book to see how you went.</p>Team<p>Liam Dunstan (Me) - Programmer<br/>Sam Huffer - Programmer<br/>Burju Kocoglu - Artist<br/>Emily Cox - Writer, Sound Sourcer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4de/4de560ca38a825b043e32bbb57e1b369.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["liamcgd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
