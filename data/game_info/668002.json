The goal is to find a <strong>secret</strong> consisting of <strong>four colors</strong> randomly selected at the beginning of each game. At each turn, the player chooses four colors from a palette of six, drops them onto the board and proceeds with the Go button. The game will then display a <strong>black mark for each choice matching both color and position</strong> and a <strong>white mark for each choice matching only color</strong>, without indicating which mark refers to which choice. The secret contains <strong>unique colors</strong>. Similarly, the player must make <strong>unique colors choices</strong> at each turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Color Cover-Up</strong> was developed as a demonstration and educational aid for the purposes of the <strong>Digital Games Development seminar</strong> organized by the<strong> Interactive Systems Design Laboratory, Department of Product and System Design Engineering, University of the Aegean</strong> and held in September 2018 in Syros, Greece.</p>\n<p>The original source code of Color Cover-Up is licensed under the MIT License and is available as a GitHub repository.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T04:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2bdb5df02736cfe5a4cf226de6c098f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["ganast"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
