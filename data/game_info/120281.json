While the main objective is to reach the exit, secondary objectives provide incentive to finish the level more quickly and traverse a more difficult path to collect items that boost the player's final score. The player will be able to memorize the level for as long as they are able to refrain from blinking, but once they do, the game \u2013 and the challenge \u2013 begins.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong><br/></p><p><strong>The game must be played in 1920x1080</strong>. Using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile device to detect blinking is optional and can be enabled under the controls menu option. This device is not required to be able to play Don't Blink.</p><p><strong>To Play:</strong><br/></p><p>Download the file and unzip it.
