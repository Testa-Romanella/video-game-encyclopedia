Run through bushes to slow enemies down, wait for an orange card to show up, and grab it do fight off any monsters nearby (And rack up some bonus points!). Throw a projectile, freeze, or roll over the monsters to take them out. But beware, the longer you stay alive, the faster these monsters get, and soon enough, running into bushes will slow you down as well. But I'll leave you to figure that one out...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T14:07:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/8746e628a533c9284ea9d22f5f982b7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ed Lytle"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
