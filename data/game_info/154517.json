Refresh browser to restart (restarting in game was broken, sorry. ^^))</strong></p>\n<p>Bullet-hell x Tower Defense!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tired of all those bullets flying at your face? Why not build some turrets to shoot them down, slow them, or even shoot back at your enemies? Welcome to Point-Defense Hell.</p>\n<p><strong>Main features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Build turrets between waves</li><li>Several enemy types</li><li>20 levels</li><li>The tried and tested controls of the shoot em\u2019 up genre</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Turret types:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Point-defense turrets</strong> shoot down enemy bullets. Can be great for making the incoming barrage more manageable. Upgrading increases their fire rate.</li><li><strong>Slow turrets </strong>slow down bullets within their area of influence (the circle.) Useful for dodging, and for slowing bullets for your point-defense turrets to take out. Upgrades increase the slow effect.</li><li><strong>Anti-Enemy turrets</strong> attack your enemies directly. Helpful to grind down your enemies if you\u2019re too busy dodging. Upgrading increases their fire rate.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Other tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Holding shift slows down your ship. Useful for fine-grained dodging.</li><li>Your hit-box is the little teal box on your ship. You only need to worry about it getting damaged.</li><li>Point-defense turrets can cause the game to lag when a lot of bullets are on screen. Definitely an issue, but I didn\u2019t have time to optimize unfortunately.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b40/b4090fbf77297b752477791e49f5dac7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Polyhatsteve"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
