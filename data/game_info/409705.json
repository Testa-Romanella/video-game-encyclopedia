You sit alone in your room. A dimly lit memory repeats in your head. 17 demos too horrible to describe keep you from your bed. Each one is a personally crafted nightmare. You've tried to tell others, no one understands. A CRT you don't remember owning flashes to life. Frozen in place you look upon the flickering screen to spy a dismal, bloodied scene. A cracked and faded jewel case sits close beside. A pale grey plastic box sits in front, emitting a low whirring noise. Will you take to the controller or let yourself be taken over?</p>\n<strong>Games:</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>A Place, Forbidden</strong></li><li><strong>Dead Heat</strong></li><li><strong>Dread Delusion</strong></li><li><strong>Effigy</strong></li><li><strong>Erasure</strong></li><li><strong>Fatum Betula</strong></li><li><strong>FILTHBREED</strong></li><li><strong>Heartworm</strong></li><li><strong>In Somnio</strong></li><li><strong>KILLER BEES</strong></li><li><strong>Neko Yume \u732b\u5922</strong></li><li><strong>Ode to a Moon - Lost Disc</strong></li><li><strong>Orange County</strong></li><li><strong>Sauna2000</strong></li><li><strong>Snowy Castle Game</strong></li><li><strong>Tasty Ramen - Gameplay Demo</strong></li><li><strong>Until Biglight</strong></li></ul>\n<strong>Note:</strong><p>The \"Demo Disc\" is not a physical disc (as amazing as that would be) as we don't have the time or resources to organise the can of worms that is monetization and physical production. We would need some sort of publisher to handle the money split and production if we were to sell a physical copy. There's also been some confusion over this, these games are all built on modern engines to evoke the feeling and aesthetic of late 90s games, the disk would not be able to run on any sort of hardware from the time. The demo disc is a free downloadable exe for Windows only. Supporting other operating systems would likely double or triple the work it took to organise the disc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-09T05:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f28/f28004cd8eddee34adf76862b8c39265.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Haunted PS1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
