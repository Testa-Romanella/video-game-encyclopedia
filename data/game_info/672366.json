The enemy is actively engaged in setting up bases to spray deadly chemtrails on your base while dumping poisonous fluoride into your fresh water sources.  Protect not only your troops but also the prisoners you rescue in the field of battle.  <br/><br/>Every mission allows you complete control on when and how you attack current threats.  Upgrade your weapons, purchase more troops, set out traps or go scouting for wild game to increase your funds.   Send out the helicopter with some airborne troops and meet up  with them in your jeep full of ground troops and overwhelm the enemy.  You might want to leave some troops behind to defend your base while your on mission. <br/><br/>It's your base - It's your choice. - dang I forgot to tell you about the bears.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T02:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78fdb22aa6a8761732de46606e457690.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 304, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ssteitle"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["ssteitle"], "esrb_rating": null}
