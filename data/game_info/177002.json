This isn't a finished game!</p><p>I worked on a 3D platformer for a while where you play as a cute and cool little safe, jumping over pits and dodging spike balls in a huge tower in order to find out what's inside your own locked door.</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong> WSAD to move and space to jump w/ keyboard, and left stick to move and a-button to jump with a controller.</p><p>There are two levels, the Foyer and the Library (which isn't finished). None of which have any real art in them. There are large cuboids around that act as checkpoints; they'll turn blue when you activate one. There are also pennies that can be collected, doors that you can enter but aren't animated and a few enemies.</p><p>I made this alone, and it started to die out as the modelling and art side of things became too much for just me. I would love to come back to this, it's a cool idea and plays quite well. Have fun checking this out!</p><p>I could never think of a name for this game...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/099/099b88cccef8f4cd595902127c65a3d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Penberthy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
