Follow the story happening in 1926, question the suspects and make a decision whom to charge of murder.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>For this game, I've looked through many vintage magazines and tried to keep aesthetics of cover illustrations from 1920s. I also hope that all outfits are historically accurate:)</p>\n<p>P.S. There are 15 possible ending of the game:)</p>\n\n<p>All art &amp; code &amp; story created by Anastasia Merzlaya;<br/>Music is taken from free assets.</p>\n\n<p>Controller:<br/>With mouse click you can select the suspects for interviewing. By clicking on the notebook icon on the bottom right corner you can open the notebook with brief notes and the action menu.</p>\n<p>I've made the game for HD resolution, and if your monitor has non-standard resolution (different from 16:9) the game might look a bit ugly.</p>\n<p>P.P.S. Sorry if there will be some small typos or misspellings</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T12:05:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b48/b48e8abb3216222d599473c6abf3f609.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ana.merzlaya"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
