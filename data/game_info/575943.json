The game is currently unbalanced.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In \"Hell's Market\", you play as an old man who's given the chance to relive his life and the store he's always dreamed of running in his past life. Thanks to the devil, he's given this chance, as long as he makes 1500 gold pieces by the end of 7 days otherwise he's sent to hell. Will you suffer before the old man?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Give him his chance!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two phases: night and day. During the daytime, you will operate 2 stocks, a gumball machine that kids love, and a sign that attracts customers and kids. But make sure to tend to your services because the kids may be bratty and mess up your stuff, leaving customers displeased and leaving until it's fixed (which has a price that increments over time). During the night, you'll have to defend your store against burglars who will attempt to steal money from the register in the middle unless you push them off by interacting with the register itself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While this is all happening, the devil is checking your progress and wants payment occasionally. If you choose to not pay him, however, the devil will expire his patience meter and the game will RESTART back to day 1, starting the cycle all over.\u00a0SO MAKE SURE TO SAVE MONEY FOR THE DEVIL!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cash will occasionally spawn on the map to help you out, but understand this is only to help you out as each day the difficulty increases, which means MORE CUSTOMERS, KIDS, AND THIEVES. Good luck and survive the 7 days if you can!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>WD / Left, Right Arrows : </strong>Move left / right <strong>F:</strong> (Hold) Interact/repair store assets / pay off the devil.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T07:55:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/345/345732d1376df49789fb02b98cc4d5bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["byteyoo"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
