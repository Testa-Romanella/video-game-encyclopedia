For some reason, the local wildlife despises your unnatural existence and relentlessly tries to destroy you. Lucky for you, you got reborn with mind control powers, so now you're using them to puppeteer a farmer to protect you. <br/></p>\n<p>Your farmer is equipped with\u00a0a scythe, a watering can,\u00a0 some seeds and towers. You can build towers, but at the\u00a0cost of some seeds. You can put seeds around towers and harvest them with the scythe to build even more towers. Furthermore the seeds can grow and buff the tower near them. But if the tower falls, all your plants will go down with it.\u00a0Will you have the skill, to defend your farm from wild enemies and\u00a0beat your personal\u00a0highscore?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/>WASD or Arrow Keys to move around<br/>Click on hotbar, scroll the mousewheel, or use keys 1-9 to choose an item.<br/>Left mouseclick to place buildings, plant seeds, or use the scythe or watering can.<br/>The scythe affects the soil tile the farmer is currently standing on.<br/>The watering can\u00a0 repairs the building the farmer is standing next to.
