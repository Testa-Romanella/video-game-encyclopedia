When I sat down in a room I met a group of lovely people who offered to let me join their team although they were already 4(!) programmers and using Unreal Engine. <br/></p>\n<p>I thought I'd give it a try because I have already worked with the Unreal Engine on some other games. BUT the games I worked on where quite lightweight, so after a few hours I realized that my laptop won't be able to do any stuff with the unreal engine so I decided to let my PC at home being fired up and connect to it remotely to work on that machine. But even that wasn't sufficient as we were using quite some heavy assets.</p>\n<p>When there were only few hours left and I hadn't done any programming until then I decided to start a small solo project in godot.</p>\n<p>It could have been a lot worse. This is the result :-)</p>\n<p>I'm quite proud of it even though I had very little time. This was the first time I made everything by myself, including the sounds, music and the sprites.</p><p>The best thing was meeting the lovely guys from the salmon game with whom I had a great time although things didn't quite work as expected. Guys, you were the best!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Game:</strong><br/></p><p>You are cruising with you space vessel through a dangerous area in space where some asteroids are suddenly appearing. This would be no problem if your ship would have gotten its last service. Now you're stuck with a broken missile launcher which launches every missile with a different delay. So aim, fire and aim again to destroy as many asteroids as possible.\u00a0</p><p>You should stay in the visible area though as there might be asteroids which you can't see if you fly out of the screen.<br/></p><p>Have fun!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> <br/></p>\r\n\r\nKeyControlA,\u00a0Left Arrow,\u00a0Controller\u00a0Left\r\nRotate Left<br/>D,\u00a0Right\u00a0Arrow,\u00a0Controller\u00a0Right\r\nRotate Right<br/>W, Up Arrow, Controller RT/R2, D-Pad Up<br/>Main Thrusters<br/>S, Down Arrow, Controller LT/L2, D-Pad DownBrake Thrusters<br/>Space, Controller A/X, Mouse Button<br/>Shoot+ / -, Mouse Wheel Up/Down, Controller Right Stick Up/Down<br/>increase/decrease volume<br/>\n<p>P.S.:\u00a0Please\u00a0also\u00a0try\u00a0out\u00a0the\u00a0game from the\u00a0guys\u00a0I\u00a0worked\u00a0with\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0place:</p><p>https://scarletmayhem.itch.io/nostalgic-salmon<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T08:07:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/0606d1fd000407ca20049ca03bd8a872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["saveng0r"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
