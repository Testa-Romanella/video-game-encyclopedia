Some with short passages and lots of dead ends, some with long, windy passages and few dead ends.  Best of all, some mazes will wrap around the edges of the screen, that is, when you go off one side, you return on the other. This makes mazes even more challenging.</p><p>This is an early version of my game.  More maze types and modes will be added in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/366/366feda3650956be464956e089efea2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TomToad"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
