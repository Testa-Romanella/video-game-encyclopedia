Collect butter &amp; jam, dodge obstacles,\u00a0and get as high of a score as possible!<br/><br/>======================<br/>MECHANICS/HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>You are continuously moving forward as obstacles try to block your path! You are capable of climbing 1-block tall obstacles and dodge using (A) and (D), but be careful.\u00a0When moving, you move back a space, and moving back too much results in a gameover. Collecting jars of jam will allow you to move forward a space AND dodge an obstacle directly in front of you, while collecting butter will increase your score. Get as far as you can and get the highest score as possible!</p>\n<p>======================</p>\n<p>This game was made within 5 days as a project for class, using the Phaser 3 framework.
