You'll encounter 14 different types of enemies, which you'll confront with 12 different weapons. During a mission, you can choose from over 100 offerings to upgrade your weapons or use special abilities. Once you've taken out enough creatures, you'll be able to call in the rescue ship, which will hopefully free you from your situation in time. Stay longer to earn more medals and unlock new levels. Or fight against each other in versus mode if you want to get revenge on your friend for always stealing all the red goblins.<br/><br/><strong>The game was designed for controllers and the multiplayer mode can only be played with such.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T02:32:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88e/88e1f4ca79e6bc5a5d266c31abd15a44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 337, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Punto Clave"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Punto Clave"], "esrb_rating": null}
