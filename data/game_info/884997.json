If no more lives are left, you've failed the stage and have to try again.<br/>And don't forget to do the dishes, too!</p>\n<p>A stage is completed once the timer reaches 0.</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nStar rating\r\n<p>A maximum of three stars are awarded per stage, one for each of the following achievements:</p>\n<ul><li>Completing the stage</li><li>Not losing a life/not missing an order</li><li>Reaching the gold score target</li></ul>\r\n\r\nOrder recipes\r\n<ul><li>Salad: chop a tomato and a lettuce on a cutting board, then put both on a plate and serve</li><li>Sandwich: put flour on a plate, put that into the oven.
