You can also upgrade your ship to be faster or collect animals faster. Once you get enough of each animal, you win the game and fly home safely!</p>\n<p>Most of my time spent developing this was on the animal AI and the skeletal mesh animations. There were a few bugs along the way that I had to figure out, but I think in the end I made some very nice basic\u00a0animal AI. The gameplay was also sort of new, as I haven't done a top down game in a while.\u00a0<br/><br/>\r\nWith this project I learned\u00a0 game development, game design, UI design, AI development, skeletal mesh animations, animation state machines, basic Unreal C++, and bug testing/troubleshooting skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T06:40:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/7805a77767e07f85413cced350888b8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jensen Tucker"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
