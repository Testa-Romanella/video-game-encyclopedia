It may be a \r\nbit hard sometimes...</p><p>2 Players mode supported :</p><p>- trip in coop, or murder your friend with a chainsaw or anything \r\nelse so he cant beat this stupid game, and say him video games are only \r\nfun to do that.</p><p>-after he ragequits and break his pad (for now you need a keyboard \r\nand a pad to play multiplayer mode) provoke him in duel with the arena \r\nmode. Then beat him because you're doing barely anything anti game.</p><p>///////////////////\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Controls : </p><p>Arrows to move and crounch</p><p>Shift to run</p><p>Space to jump</p><p>Alt to pick up/throw/attak.</p><p>2nd player has a silly console gamepad i'm sure he will be fine to find keys.</p><p>Throwing things and jumping are sensitive. Hold quickly Alt to attack, or the longer you press it, the longer you throw it.</p><p>You can throw pushig the \"up\" key to throw higher, or let your weapon holding down while pushing the throw key.</p><p>It seems clear and simple. Now go kill the bosses and make your way through the end.</p><p>Hope you'll enjoy it. </p><p>PS:Never had a NES, but i had a GameBoy and Master System II.</p><p>I tried to stick to most of the<strong> limitations of the NES ,</strong> but not everything.By\r\n the way I think it doesn't look so much like nes, maybe more like \r\nMaster System i used to play. The name is a joke kids, you kids.</p><p>Alex Kid make me so frustrated 20 years later when realized Shi Fu Mi were actually always the same combinations in this game.</p><p>I never noticed it as a kid... Did You ?</p><p>And do you still have that silly music in the head ? \r\n\"touloup,touloup, touloup,TOULOUP, TOULOUP TOULOUP TOUP TOUP TOUP \r\nTOUP\".... you know what i mean ?No???what?</p><p>And did you know the seal with a runny nose was actually a WITCH????WTF??</p><p>Ah. And the game is still uncomplete but i thought the jam will give \r\nme opportunity to release something. There is still few things i'll be \r\nadding in next version, like scores and more VS arenas and minigames, \r\nbut i was in a hurry to upload a working version for the jam so i'll be \r\nadding it later ;</p><p>Levels were made too quickly for the jam, and i did not use 50% of \r\nthe visuals and tiles that have been made. Level design sometime sucks i\r\n think, and there are LOT less levels/weapons/enemies that planned. \r\nSomeday, maybe, i'll be fixing it and add many stuff, depending on \r\nreactions...</p><p>Maybe Axel Dick 2 ?</p><p>Hahahaha who knows ?</p><p>Enjoy.</p><p>Knarf.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60d/60d5b4638d7fae943647297271e197a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kNARF"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
