Alchemy is a very real ability to manipulate the forces of nature and machines run using clockworks and steam. Humans have united under the Empire, a mighty continent-wide government that seeks to harness the power of alchemy, while the horned race of ferans lives in tenuous peace.<br/><br/>A wandering alchemist named Dougal, and his icebat Familiar, Isaac, wind up in Isenbarr, an isolated frontier town that is about as cold as you can get. But, when he tries to get a job, he stumbles upon a mysterious challenge with a potentially priceless reward, and several other alchemists vying for the prize. He must use all the alchemical skills at his disposal in order to defeat the monster plaguing the town and prove himself worthy.
