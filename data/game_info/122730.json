Hadley, with a few minor gameplay tweaks to make it feel different. The premise is simple: collect 3 notes randomly placed in 13 possible locations. As you progress and pick up more notes, the creature will move faster and faster. You can use a night vision device to find the notes more easily, but that will also increase temporarily the creature's speed.<br/><br/>Playing on Nightmare is the real deal: no night vision, no clues pointing at where they are and, worst of all, the creature can sometimes appear in front of you. <strong>Play Nightmare Mode only whenever you feel ready</strong>, so you can see the true ending of this story.<br/></p><p>Any question or suggestion will be welcomed in the comment section. ;)</p><p>GAME AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH/SPANISH.<br/></p><p>COMPATIBLE WITH 360 CONTROLLER.</p><p>LowSpecGamer seal of approval!</p><p><em>Enrique \"Baxayaun\" Colinet.
