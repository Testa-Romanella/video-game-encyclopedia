The controls are simple. The action is fast-paced. Insane dogfights lead to epic, screen-filling bosses. But the truth is:<br/><br/>You don\u2019t know what Cycle 28 is. Not yet.<br/><br/>As Olivia Bergen \u2013 a flight lieutenant that has become separated from her fleet \u2013 you only know Cycle 27. You live it over, and over, and over again. And if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, every time you drop from warp they are waiting for you.<br/><br/>You don\u2019t know who they are or what they want. You just know you\u2019re the only thing between them and home. So you get better, faster, stronger. Maybe one of these Cycle\u2019s you\u2019ll figure it out. Until then, you can only keep dying.<br/><br/><strong>Key features</strong><br/><strong>Kaleidoscopic space combat</strong>  \u2014 G-force fuelled battles against an unknown, unknowable enemy. An arcade shooter reminiscent of classic and modern pillars of the genre, which demands focus, cunning, and a gunner\u2019s timing.<br/><br/><strong>Upgrades</strong> \u2014 Beat your personal high score in a run to unlock upgrades. With over 100 possible configurations, customise your ship and master new tactics to live just a little longer.<br/><br/><strong>Evolving story</strong> \u2014 Uncover the secrets of why you\u2019re stuck in Cycle, why they\u2019re hell-bent on destroying everything you love, and just who they really are.<br/><br/><strong>Epic original score</strong> \u2014 A powerfully atmospheric mix of modern orchestral and retro electronic sounds by Jordan Rees (Blade Runner 2049 IMAX Countdown, Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare DLC Trailer, The Defenders TV Trailer).<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Cycle 28 won\u2019t be easy. It won\u2019t be quick. But that\u2019s okay.
