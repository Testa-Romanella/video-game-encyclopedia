Many of them were about me trying to learn specifics of coding and experimenting designs that were too weird to continue development while trying to make something funny with it. These projects were actually made four years ago, and it was part of my plan to take this long to go back to them, make them presentable and release them to the public here.</p>\n<p>Number 10 is a funny little experiment. Our theme was to make a game based on another game a friend made during that same class. I decided to make a game based on Sanic Spin 2006, one of my favorites! Just as we have the creepypasta game Sonic.exe, I decided to make a 3D variant and make a creepypasta version of Sanic Spin 2006. I hope you have fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD and Mouse to control Sanic.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Space to jump.</strong></p>\n<p>Not really an objective here, just play it to the end.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I didn't do, nor I claim to own, any of the music or art in this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/643e801c3118676a87185b439e24c4d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mauriciojuliano"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
