GET IT HERE &gt;\u00a0Heres that link wowza</strong></p>\n<p><em>Monster Takeout: Bone App\u00e9tit</em> is a game made for the WWU Jam. The theme was \"spooky skeletons boop boop\" but we took that theme and combined it with the idea of a Chinese takeout joint for monsters! Follow Oscar Perosis as he attempts to keep his dead end job by investigating who stole supplies from the kitchen.</p>\n<p><strong>Cute monster boys/girls! Detectives! Puns abound!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This is a super rough alpha, mostly as a presentation for what the game would look like and what the general concept will be. You can only really talk to everyone once, but make sure to check everything weird looking, like plant pots or uncovered manholes!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was developed in 36 hours by Mason Saulsbury and Cathy D'Anna.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29c/29c36f71e6db978365598b9df3ff4b72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Punkitt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
