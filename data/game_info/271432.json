Oversee your fleet as they fight off the invaders. Guide them to take down targets, and choose when to sacrifice your ships to unleash the ultimate attack. See how many waves of the ever increasing alien forces you can survive!</p>\n<p>Ships fight automatically following their AI.</p>\n<p>Click an enemy to mark it as a focus for a few seconds. Your ships will try to switch to that as their target.</p>\n<p>Click one of your ships to overload its power core and unleash an attack that destroys anything, sacrificing it in the process.</p>\n<p>All surviving ships will join in the next wave along with reinforcements. The more you save earlier, the more you\u2019ll have for when things get really tough!</p>\n<p>Your ships are weaker in general than the alien ships, and they begin to outnumber you quickly. Cunning use of the ultimate attacks can help you cut your losses. Be sure to make use of a ship that is doomed before it gets destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>This was a compo\u00a0entry for Ludum Dare 43: Sacrifices Must Be Made.</p>\n<p>This game was made in GameMaker 2, with Aseprite for all graphics and sfxr for all sound effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb4/eb4a30d55cc66062196a304be4f89bf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wizard.Exe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
