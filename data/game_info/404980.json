Player always stops at predetermined positions (there are 5 positions).</p>\n<p>You hit the ball if you are positioned correctly when it arrives. It chooses a random position on the enemy court as soon as you hit.</p>\n<p>You have to collect coins to gather powerups, which can be used using the Z and X keys, according to their position on your inventory.</p>\n<p>These are the current powerups available:</p>\n<ul><li> Earthquake:\u00a0Shakes the screen around making it more difficult to see where the ball is headed.</li><li> Curved ball: Ball changes direction mid-way.</li><li> Ghost ball:\u00a0Ball becomes invisible until hit again.</li><li> Fast ball: Ball becomes a lot faster until hit again.</li><li> Time slower: Time slows down but players can still move quickly.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>\n<p>The game itself is a cross between Timber Tennis and Mario Kart, in the essence that it plays like pong (Timber Tennis style) but you are able to get random power-ups to help you beat the opponent.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pricing\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is free to play on your browser (you are free to make any donations).</p>\n<p>If you want to download a standalone executable (for Windows, Linux, OS and raspberry) you can do so at a small charge to help support further game development.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>In development\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is still being developed, with the current areas being worked on right now:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- increase number of opponents and their variability</p>\n<p>\u00a0- add local multiplayer support</p>\n\n<p><strong>Feedback\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Did you like it or hate it?
