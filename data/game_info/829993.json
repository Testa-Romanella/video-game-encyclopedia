Every sale of Garden Guardian will fund the planting of a tree through the Plant-for-the-Planet organization. Although Garden Guardian is a small game, we hope that over time we can help to plant thousands of trees through this initiative, and we hope we can encourage other game developers and publishers to consider joining in to pledge financial support to vital environmental, social, and communal efforts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T14:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ab/3aba5634121e9ed980dd56644c20486e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["liam allen-miller"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
