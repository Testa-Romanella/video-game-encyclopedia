Fight!</strong> You have a big responsibility, and that is the very large <strong>threat of radiators</strong>, which have recently started <strong>rising up</strong>. Start out in a room with <strong>nothing</strong> but a <strong>Heater</strong> in it, and <strong>kick your way</strong> to the <strong>end game boss!</strong> The fate of the world is in <strong>your hands.</strong></p>\n\n\n<ul><li>\u00a0Clicker Room</li><li>Upgrade Shop with many useful and fun items</li><li>Boss Room with progress bar</li><li>Final Boss</li><li>Unique Tower-Defense-like Boss Fight</li><li>Winning and Losing</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Easter Eggs</li><li>Full Guide in every tab</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>The <strong>main goa</strong>l is to <strong>Kick the Heater</strong>, which gives you <strong>points.</strong> You can spend these points in <strong>Raidy's Shop</strong> to buy <strong>Upgrades</strong> which can help a LOT when <strong>clicking</strong>. Once you've gained enough points, you can stop by<strong> Major's Base</strong> and summon <strong>Heatlord</strong> - the game's <strong>Final Boss</strong>. You can also unlock <strong>Achievements</strong> throughout the game, which are very fun and mysterious to unlock, as you <strong>aren't told how to unlock them before you actually acomplish them.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you gain enough <strong>points</strong>, you can buy <strong>Upgrades in Raidy's Shop</strong>. These include <strong>Multipliers</strong> and an<strong> AutoClicker</strong>. Multipliers multiply the <strong>amount</strong> of <strong>points</strong> you get with <strong>one click</strong>. These help a lot with<strong> gaining points </strong>and speed up the process of gaining them <strong>quite significantly</strong>.\u00a0You can also spend <strong>points</strong> on <strong>Cosmetic Items</strong>, which can<strong> spice up</strong> the look of your game and<strong> refresh your experience.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon reaching a <strong>sufficient amount of points</strong>, you can visit<strong> Major's Base </strong>and summon <strong>Heatlord</strong> - the end game <strong>boss</strong> and fight him in a unique <strong>Tower-Defense-like Boss Fight</strong>. You'll need to<strong> strategise</strong> wheter to spend <strong>money</strong> to attack him, or spend money to build new <strong>Upgrade Buildings</strong> or to simply <strong>repair your Defenses</strong>. There's multiple <strong>playstyles</strong> you can take to beat <strong>Heatlord</strong>, but I recommend to<strong> buy all the upgrades for an Ultimate Experience.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I won't spoil what the rest of the<strong> Fight </strong>or <strong>Heatlord</strong>\u00a0looks like, it's up to <strong>you</strong> to find out yourself. Well? What are you waiting for? Jump right into it!</p>\n\n<p>* This was a short project that I've worked on over the course of three weeks.
