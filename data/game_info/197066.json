You must collect them or they will collect you. This game is based on a series of objects directed towards you. The objects look like cans of Soda Irn Bru. The game is a point game system \u00a0for one player only. The main point of the game is to collect as many points as you can. You will do so by pressing the keys A, W, and D depending \u00a0where the Irn Bru is located. If you press one of the keys and the Irn Bru is not there, you will lose a live. If you allow the Irn Bru to get pass your screen you will also lose a live. You have a total of 3 lives. Lets see how far you can go.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36b530de409496b466f2841d5a05a0dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["edwinacos55"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
