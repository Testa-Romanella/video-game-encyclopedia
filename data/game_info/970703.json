She's unsure about her life's direction -- and doubly so when the whole thing goes off the rails. Beset by problems new and old, how will she keep it together?<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/>Sadie's good friend from college, Diya is just as ready to help out as she is to throw shade. With her sharp instincts, she knows something is up - and she won't let Sadie leave her in the dark about her new \"friends\". Whether she can handle the truth is another matter...<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/>Sadie is still recovering from her break-up with Vincent, her skinny Australian boyfriend for the last year. Things seemed to be great until they discovered their diverging opinions about keeping pets, which prompted the separation, but old flames sometimes burn longest... assuming her dogs don't snuff it out.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/>With a subdued demeanor and thoughtful gaze, Peaches (name customizable) is the more intellectual-seeming of Sadie's dog duo. Or maybe he just has the lax hubris of a creature that's been spoiled with treats and cuddles. He doesn't really care either way.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/>Intensely loyal and obviously needy, Pecan (name customizable) is a girl's best friend - as long as you stay out of her war path. Her obsessive love for Sadie is matched only by her distaste for Peaches, but her true fixation is the sky and all the evil it harbors.
