It has a basic story line (not yet inserted) that tells a bit about what happened <br/>before Alan wakes up in a terrible underground place.</p>\n<p>Currently it is in its demo version (beta), with only one level and some things <br/>to be corrected, which will be done in its full version.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game\u00a0 is to be as difficult as possible, so at higher levels (not yet avaliable) resources will be scarce. Another feature that we stop putting to increase the difficulty, is the absence of the map, leaving the player lost most of the time and having to redo the route several times. Other features will be deployed soon.</p>\n<p>Comment and share, your opinion about the game is important.</p>\n<p>CGN Studios.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/9333eba55d17223342df87ad8a52ab67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CGN Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
