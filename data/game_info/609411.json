In this surreal new reality, whether you\u2019re small like a cat, big like a statue, whether it\u2019s early morning or late evening, you\u2019ll see things differently and you\u2019ll only see what you want to see. The red lifeforce flows through everything, dead or alive, old and new. Eva Quantica is about female power, patriarchy, immigration, tradition and obligation. She explores technology as an agent of power for women and its consequences and wants to challenge the rules that always apply. She wants to tell women that they have a place in the making of a new technological future where they can encode their own reality. http://www.limbicfish.net/eva-quantica</p>\n<p>Commissioned by the National Gallery, London, as part of\u00a0National Gallery X and Audience Labs at the Royal Opera House\u00a0in March 2021 Supported by King\u2019s College London Inspiration from Crivelli\u2019s Gardens, by Paula Rego and using the motion capture data of Eve, choreographed by Kristen McNally</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a89daa59a0665aeae621874edfe89bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Maf'j Alvarez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
