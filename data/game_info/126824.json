Yet in this desert is a society built around The Arena. Exiles are rescued from the desert on the condition that they earn back their lives through combat in The Arena. </p><p>Between intense bouts of hand to hand combat, you will have a chance to interact with other wanderers trapped in the cycle of The Arena. Friendships are forged, rivalries boil over, and everyone is desperate to get out. You have a chance to earn your freedom...so long as you don't succumb to the allure of combat.</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>In Combat:<ul><li><strong>TIP:</strong> Dodge and block your opponent's attacks until they let their guard down.
