Losing results in death, can you survive?\r\n</p>\n<p>GAME FEATURES:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A unique 2D art style with interesting character designs.\r\n</li><li>New game mechanics unique to Five Nights at Paite's.\r\n</li><li>Endless night mode with GameJolt Scoreboard rankings.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A CPU that can process things (really doesn't matter too much but at least have 2 cores)\r\n</li><li>256 MBs RAM at the very minimum\r\n</li><li>DX11 compatible GPU\r\n</li><li>Windows 7 or higher\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>FOR THOSE ON MAC OR LINUX:\r\n</p>\n<p>There isn't much else I can say beyond using something like wine to run the game on your OS since I don't currently have any plans to create official Mac or Linux ports of FNAP, sorry but that's just kinda how it is.\"</p>\n\n<p>At least that was the original description for this game, unfortunately I decided to cancel the game so it will no longer be developed, I do have a build of the game that you can play though. It has all of the main nights playable alongside an unlockable (though unfinished) additional night.</p>\n<p>While this is cancelled, it is arguably a lot more complete than anything else I have uploaded here, there is stuff missing, placeholder assets are used a bunch still like with the jumpscares, Edgy Paite's design was never finished, etc. I'm sure there's still some entertainment that can be taken out of this game though.</p>\n<p>Oh right before I go, since this is a Clickteam game you can find the save file in %appdata% (specifically in the MMFApplications folder). If you type DebugOn=1 into the file (or input up+down+left+right on the warning screen) it'll turn on a special debug mode I created for play testers with this mode enabled:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Pressing the numbered keys while in-game moves characters\u00a0</li><li>You can change the AI level of the characters in-game\u00a0</li><li>When you press '#' you can enter a separate menu with extra settings.</li></ul>\n<p>Finally, I will eventually release the MFA file for this game, there's some stuff I need to sort out first but yeah thanks for reading please download the game thankey.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T03:39:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a63/a631acda7f3ac9057c156acbdf15e16c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paite"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
