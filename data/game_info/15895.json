Instead you have some amount of water on a metal field with obstacles and special points for exits and coloring. <br/><br/>It could not be obvious from the description but exits only accept liquid of specific color so most of the time your task is to split the water to several parts, dye it and move to the exit avoiding black holes and open field boundaries.
