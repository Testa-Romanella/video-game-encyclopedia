To win, restore the world to its natural alpine beauty before they devour you.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I didn't pay enough attention to the instructions, so my game is focused around colour rather than the intended limitation. I\u00a0hope people will still enjoy playing it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All art is placeholder art, but the game is relatively systems-complete. If you win (by painting 80% of the tiles) your map size will increase (and this will persist across sessions). If you're a pixel artist and would be interested in being involved as I add more to the game, send me a message!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, as I didn't have chance to add explanations for the abilities:</p>\n<p>1. Increasing the flower level spawns more flowers, adds penetration and range.</p>\n<p>2. The spiral plant is a thorn attack. It does a large aoe attack behind your horizontal movement. Upgrading it increases damage.</p>\n<p>3. The mortar and pestle reduces cooldowns.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T06:11:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75d1af98185c33bf2a975f781e1d1c06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["frithknight"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
