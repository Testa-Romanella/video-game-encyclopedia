We all know the prime place to get your next bounty is a tavern! You, as a bright eyed young intern just graduated with a bachelors in bountyology, have decided that it's your time to shine when it comes to the bounty business! Instead of hunting down those pesky criminals... you decided that you want to work in the local tavern. Your job is to not only sell drinks, but to play matchmaker between bounties and bounty hunters! You must study these brutes, haggle with them, and last a week in The Tavern to get hired full time.</p>\n\r\nThe Cast\r\n\n<p>Who is this handsome buckaroo? WELL IT'S YOU OF COURSE! You're an intern starting off at The Tavern. You need to prove to your boss that you can match the weeks bounties to worthy bounty hunters!</p>\n\n<p>This ain't your run of the mill thug. THIS is a PIRATE. Don't underestimate them! They're great when it comes to plundering for gold and other riches! They have a deep connection within the black market and despise royalty.</p>\n\n<p>This mysterious lass/lad is great for making deadly poisons... They also have a way of persuading folks with their fortune telling! You'll need the FORTUNE TELLER when there are jobs that require delicacy and planning!</p>\n\n<p>Looking for a heavy lifter? Someone who's got the brains AND the brawn? Then the body builder is who you're looking for! You want them for missions that include great feats of strength. Fair warning however... though they may be a BODY BUILDER, that doesn't mean they are a good one!<br/></p>\n\r\nThe Team\r\n<ul><li>Gavin Camlin<ul><li>@GavinCamlin</li><li>gcamlin@gmail.com</li><li>Eligible for the Grand Prize</li></ul></li><li>Jennifer Kindl<ul><li>@Kindlsticks</li><li>jenniferkindl17@gmail.com</li><li>Eligible for the Grand Prize</li></ul></li><li>Yukon\u00a0Wainczak<ul><li>@YWainczak</li><li>hello@yukonw.com</li><li>Eligible for the Grand Prize</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Production Music courtesy of www.epidemicsound.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/98270ea79ef4179a791c6a665a99a967.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yukon W."], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
