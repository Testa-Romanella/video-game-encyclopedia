Can you find a way to escape from the wizard's castle?</p>\n<p>This was hard. I made this game mainly to practice building menu systems, and I feel like I learned a lot. However, it took so much longer to put those systems together than I thought it would, that I wound up having only one day to build the adventure itself. I really wish I'd saved this for the \"make a game in two weeks\" step.</p>\n<p>This game took about thirty-two hours in total to make. It and all of its art and audio assets were made by me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:29:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3eef2b94fe6aea63eabcf969fcf08675.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Snowy Fox"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
