Small, tadpole-like creatures called the issimo want to perform their music, but they need you to listen to their song and help them figure out when to sing!

The melodies themselves are also simple, allowing beginners or even slightly more experienced musicians a satisfying challenge. issimo! is a prototype game, as well, meaning it may be short, but even a little goes a long way in learning by ear!</p><p>issimo! is created entirely by Hannah Pogue, featuring an original concept, original art, and original sounds and music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92bf65f5851be6106f2836afe5ac4b26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["hpogue2012"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
