{"id": 273858, "slug": "beat-sacrifice-ld43", "name": "Beat Sacrifice - LD43", "name_original": "Beat Sacrifice - LD43", "description": "<p>Simple prototype for LD43. Theme was \"Sacrifices Must Be Made\". The plan was to balance failures and make the game a lot more difficult than\u00a0 it is. If you want to see the game over screen, spam the stab button. The loud clangs mean your doing it right. Another missing feature was different endings depending on how many people were spared and sacrificed by the time the BPM gets ridiculously fast.</p><p>X do do almost everything. R to restart from the game over screen. Esc to close the app when the game is playing.</p>\n<p>Art by Pako -\u00a0https://twitter.com/Okapook</p>\n<p>Ground \"art\" and development by me<br/></p>\n<p>All sounds are CC0:<br/></p>\n<p>Game Over Music:\u00a0\"Bittersweet\" by Emma_MA(https://opengameart.org/users/emmama)</p>\n<p>Sacrifice spared\u00a0\"Thank You\":\u00a0 \"Thank you (NPC, British Male)\"  by\u00a0theuncertainman</p>\n<p>Clang sound: \"LightRingingClang.mp3\" by\u00a0wilhellboy</p>\n<p>Sacrifice sound: \"clap mix2.wav\" by\u00a0young_daddy</p>\n<p>Beat sound: \"kick_gettinglaid.wav\" by\u00a0DWSD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d99/d9955efb8cd505de8ad18bfbf230ec7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itsn8"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
