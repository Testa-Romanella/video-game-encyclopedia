The player is an unhappy cloud that slowly becomes happier as the game processes. This is my first complete game, however lots of work needs to be done on the game as there is no animations, sounds or particle effects. Hopefully the download works, I had some trouble uploading as a browser game.\u00a0Please leave feedback and ways I can get better! Also search KaleSandwichGames on Youtube for an upcoming Devlog!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T04:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc4/cc4c4fcc0ea1a2d5a8c329e99eb313f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kalesandwich"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
