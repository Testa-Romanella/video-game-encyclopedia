{"id": 608157, "slug": "item-assistant", "name": "Item Assistant", "name_original": "Item Assistant", "description": "<p>This game is my submission for the Godot Wild Jam #33, \"You aren't the Hero\"\r\n </p>\n<p>Built using Godot Engine (Version 3.3.1)\r\n </p>\n<p>My take on the theme is that, rather than being the bad guy fighting  the Hero, you would play as the Hero's assistant. I decided to make the  player characters role being the Hero's item management. The Hero will  proceed to fight the enemies on his own, relying on the player, to give  him the item that he needs to get his job done (which is of course  beating up the baddies). <br/></p>\n\n<p>Different enemies have different weaknesses, so it's the assistants  job to keep track of which weapons are effective against which types of  enemies. The player will also need to ensure that the Hero does not run  out of Health (red bar), Mana (blue bar), or Stamina (yellow bar). If  the Hero's Stamina runs out, then he will be unable to swing his weapon,  if his Mana runs out, then he will be unable to use the magical staffs,  and if the Hero's health runs out, then the Hero will fall in battle  and the Game will be over! <br/></p>\n\n<p>If the assistant does a good job managing the Hero's inventory,  monitoring the Hero's Health, Mana, and Stamina, and remembering the  weapons that are the most effective against the different types of  enemies, then they can help the Hero can defeat many more enemies than  he ever could on his own! <br/></p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy Item Assistant! This is my first full game made in  Godot Engine and my first ever Game Jam submission. I have learned a lot  in making this game, and I hope that you enjoy playing it as much as I  enjoyed making it! Cheers, and thanks for playing!\r\n </p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>Left Arrow Key: Switch to the previous item in your inventory\r\n</li><li>Right Arrow Key: Switch to the next item in your inventory\r\n</li><li>Space-bar/Enter Key: Swap items with the Hero\r\n</li><li>Escape Key: Pause the game\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>If you would like to look at the source code, it is available here: https://github.com/matt-cles/item-assistant<br/></p>\n<p>Item Assistant \u00a9 2021 by Matthew Cles is licensed under Attribution 4.0 International.
