{"id": 339129, "slug": "swarm-16k", "name": "Swarm 16k", "name_original": "Swarm 16k", "description": "<p>Swarm 16k is a\u00a0Real Time Strategy game for your Commodore 64.\u00a0The game engine balances a good gameplay experience with pushing the limits of C64 to project and control over 200 units in real-time.</p>\r\nPlot\r\n<p>Each star\u00a0in a galaxy is a sign of wonder, each grain of stardust is\u00a0a wonder in itself. And with the League of All Kronosights, you shall own the space. As the commander of Kronosights Research And Conquer department, your aim is to conquer the unknown areas of the Atlasia galaxy.</p>\n<p>You have to know more before we start... Kronosights, the earthlings who were banished from the planet Earthia in 31st century, found the space to be their new home. They were expanding through the vast space using resources extracted from asteroids. Only few people remember\u00a0days - and probably\u00a0only from the Krono-machinaeteevee-stories - about first Kronosights who discovered chemical elements never seen before in the place from where their families came, the Earthia.</p>\n<p>Discovering new resources and exploring new ways of utilizing them sustained\u00a0Kronosights for\u00a0centuries... but by entering the Atlasia Galaxy,\u00a0they met an opponent they didn't know.\u00a0Kronosights prosperity was no longer a sure thing.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to take\u00a0control over the area which contains up to 8 asteroids,\u00a0and where you have to fight against the\u00a0alien race you never met before. The location\u00a0of asteroids\u00a0is unknown each time you enter the area: be careful each time you embark on your resource-saving mission.</p>\r\n\r\nTitle screen\r\n<p>Hit RETURN on the main screen to start a new game.</p>\r\nSpace area\r\n<p>On space area you see your units and asteroids and also enemy objects as long as they are in the range of your radars. Game uses fog of war concept which means that only by discovering the space area you can\u00a0find enemy or neutral asteroids.</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> keys - use to control the cursor and move the space area screen in all 4 directions<br/></p>\n<p><strong>RETURN</strong> key - enables cursor in \"blue\" select mode, selects in \"red\" command mode<br/></p>\n<p>When cursor is in \"blue\" select mode:</p>\n<p>- when hitting RETURN over the asteroid you'll enter\u00a0an asteroid</p>\n<p>- when hitting RETURN over\u00a0a ship you'll activate the unit into \"red\" command mode</p>\n<p>- by keeping RETURN key pressed and moving with WASD keys you can choose more units</p>\n<p>- with \"ESC\" key (left arrow) you can cancel select mode</p>\n<p>When cursor is in \"red\" command mode:</p>\n<p>- you can select target or destination by hitting RETURN again</p>\n<p>- with \"ESC\" key (left arrow) you can cancel command</p>\n<p><strong>C</strong> - centre over the selected ship units</p>\n<p><strong>N</strong> - switch to the next ship unit<br/></p>\n<p><strong>1 - 8 keys</strong> - when you will discover an asteroid, its location\u00a0will be assigned to one of eight numeric keys so you can easily switch through them. It works\u00a0not only on the space area screen, but also you can switch between asteroids from the asteroid\u00a0menu</p>\n<p><strong>P</strong> - pause the game from the space area screen</p>\n\r\nAsteroid menu\r\n<p>Entering an asteroid is possible by hitting RETURN key over the\u00a0asteroid in \"blue\" select cursor mode.</p>\n<p><strong>A, D</strong> keys - choose option</p>\n<p><strong>RETURN</strong> key - select option</p>\n<p><strong>ESC</strong> to go level up (or use Exit option)</p>\n<p><strong>1 - 8</strong> keys - switch between other asteroids you own</p>\r\nWarping\r\n<p>Here you can manage to warp new ships from\u00a0the League Of All Kronosights. Gate will open in surroundings of the\u00a0asteroid by choosing \"warp\" option. You can select from Kronosus and Daedalus which is twice more powerful than the first one. Thanks to the recent improvements, our warps are almost instant. However, gate cannot be opened if space around the asteroid is taken by another ship. Please keep a\u00a0centre\u00a0of any asteroid clear.</p>\r\nMines\r\n<p>By entering mines menu, you can build a mine for one of the following resources:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Perilium 2: 1 unit =\u00a02 Z credits</p>\n<p>- AMK Y: 1 unit = 4 Z credits</p>\n<p>- Kynxal: most desired, 1 unit = 8 Z credits</p>\n<p>The first number next to the mine indicates the number of mines build, the second one stands for the available known resources. E.g. 12/17 means that there are only 12 mines in operation as this is the amount of the available resources at the moment out from 17 mines built in total. The available resources may vary during the game. 17/17 means that probably there are more resources available but you might know that only by building another one.</p>\r\nShield\r\n<p>You can build a magnetic\u00a0shield to protect your asteroid from being taken by the enemy. If shield is present, enemy has to destroy the shield first to conquer an asteroid. You can repair your shield by enabling repair mode but be careful as it's quite expensive. Once the shield is repaired fully, repair mode is switched off.</p>\r\nGame mechanics\r\n<p>Units fight automatically so you cannot target individual enemy ship, however they will do the best to cross fire over a single unit in the way it can be\u00a0eliminated as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Mines can deplete or new resources can be found.</p>\n<p>More to discover, more fun!</p>\r\nTechnical details\r\n<p>- Ability to control up to 100 ship units at the same time thus name of the game! Enemy opponent controls another 100 ship units in real time</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0In the worst case for\u00a0all 200 ship units, operation update cycle can take up to 2 seconds, but on the average this time is half a second<br/></p>\n<p>- Enemy opponent AI controls the balance between building mines, conquering asteroids and making efficient attacks</p>\n<p>- Using double buffering to project ship units and asteroids gives result of\u00a010 FPS</p>\n<p>- Ability to select multiple ship units at once in \"stretchy\" selection box</p>\n<p>- Only 69 bytes left free after using Exomizer 2 and even that was possible after\u00a0a shuffle of\u00a0functions layout to fit the game in 16k</p>\r\nFrom author\r\n<p>Enjoy the game! Feedback is more than welcome! It was hard to fit this game in 16k using Exomizer2 packer so few more features and ideas are not present in the game as planned, but this version is still fully playable :).</p>\n<p>Support <em>Commocore</em> https://www.commocore.com !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T05:52:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a9/8a966eae4d4280929f050e9ec8ae1ed8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Commocore"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
