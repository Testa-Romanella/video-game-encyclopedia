He tries \n      to fix a time machine to save the planet from explosion. Everything \n      happens in Greek mythology timeframe.

The story starts with Zeus flying his spaceship and \n      landing it in the bottom of the Santorini Ocean. In Santorini he will \n      interact with dozens of crazy characters and solve many smart puzzles. \n      The game is big, full length. He will visit Oia, Akrotiri, Fira, \n      Caldera, Volcano and many more places until he finally discovers his \n      super weapon, the thunder and the time machine box. But even then the \n      task is far from over, he will have to set sail to another cluster of \n      Greek islands, Milos, Karpathos, Mykonos and Delos. There he has to find \n      the scattered pieces of the time machine so that he can use it to save \n      the planet. There he will even abduct Europe transformed into a bull \n      (mythology) and take her to Minoan Crete in the Knossos timeframe. There \n      he will enter the famous labyrinth of Knossos, go to Festos and find the \n      missing pieces to complete the mission.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Crazysoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
