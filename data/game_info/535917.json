The goal of our project was to create a game based of Super Hot. We thought this can be achieved by following a similar art style, having limited colours that highlight the important aspects of the game such as weapons and enemies. We also wanted to include time elements with our own unique take on the concept. Instead of time moving when the player moves, the player has special abilities that allow them to slow down the world's time as well as slowing down and speeding up relative time for various enemies and map elements such as moving platforms and gravity lifts.</p>\n<p>This game was created by:</p>\n<p>- Connor Younger (Project Manager, Lead Programmer, Artist, Designer, Sound Designer)</p>\n<p>- Daniela Galea (Lead Sound Designer, Artist, Designer)</p>\n<p>- Ken Soun (Designer, Artist, Sound Designer)</p>\n<p>- Andrew Peggins (Designer, Artist)</p>\n<p>For more information, check out our showcase page:\u00a0https://sites.google.com/student.sae.edu.au/showcase20t2-troubleshooter/home</p>\n<p>**We did not make the music used in the game, all the rights belong to the respectful owners**</p>\n<p>Music Links:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:09:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/035/035b5ace543914a9b2425435ac40aea5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Connor Younger"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
