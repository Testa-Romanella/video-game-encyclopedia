We were given one rule to follow; make the game a one button game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're wondering where the \"U\" in bounce has gone, well, so are we. One of our 2D artists can't spell, and the name just stuck.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy playing!</p>\n<p>With love,</p>\n<p>Triple B Studios</p>\n<p><strong>PLAY INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>The space key is the only button you'll need to play this game. Hit space to send a shock-wave to the enemies, propelling them into the walls. Your aim is to knock them all out and be the last one standing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The center of the arena enables the player to fly into any direction they choose. Use it wisely!</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>Joe George: Producer/3D Modelling</p>\n<p>John Skelly: Lead Designer/Sound</p>\n<p>Harry Miller: Programmer</p>\n<p>Olly Smith: Programmer</p>\n<p>Enishan: 2D Art</p>\n<p>Michael Romerosa: 2d Art</p>\n<p>James Cooley: 2D Art</p>\n<p>Jamie Notarantonio: Soundtrack and emotional support</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:09:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f65/f65652bdab2c41b711a032868aba07c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Joe George", "Triple B Studios"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
