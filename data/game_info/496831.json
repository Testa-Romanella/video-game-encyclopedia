Run into them to kill them and send them back to their side.</p>\n<p>When on THEIR side (the red side), the orange juice will chase you and try to stop you from stealing their bananas. If they catch you before you make it back to your side, you will NOT get those bananas added to the score. :(</p>\n<p>ALSO IMPORTANT: You have to wait 10 seconds straight\u00a0of staying on your side for the enemy bananas to respawn after you steal them.</p>\n<p>The GOAL of the game is A) just to win by stealing more bananas than the orange juice stole from you and B) to try and get a good final\u00a0score.</p>\n<p>PS: that banana is not from the\u00a0asset store! We made that lol. We also made the orange juice.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T03:36:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/293/29364eecd870476bf4e5e496d3f31508.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SushiWaUmai"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
