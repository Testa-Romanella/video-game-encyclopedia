This game recognizes the challenges and changes made necessary to embedded tutoring in a remote Physics course, particularly a need to engage with writers as people navigating complex and fraught situations.</strong></p>\n<p>In the age of COVID-19 and remote tutoring, such work requires being attuned to change as we spend two hours a week in lecture and several more in tutoring. In the game, time is a resource the player allocates to different tasks, simulating our limited time in lecture. In a text-based format, the students will be represented by their names, as if on a Zoom call with their cameras off. Player actions include clicking on a student\u2019s name to learn more about the student; moderating chat to gain information on student questions, comments, and concerns; and \u2018paying attention\u2019 to the lecture, which \u2018enhances\u2019 knowledge of the subject for the tutor. These tasks are designed to increase the player\u2019s understanding of the students, and realize that they aren\u2019t simply flat names in Zoom boxes, but rather people with unique challenges and learning needs.</p>\n<p>After someone completes the game, our hope is players will gain a sense of embedded tutoring experiences during a lecture. Ultimately, our game emphasizes that each tutee is a person, like us. Embedded tutoring provides the unique opportunity to develop personal bonds and enhance our quality of feedback and support for tutees.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:15:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebcd0fd34483fcedb61ac835918d9fb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["portaljumperjen"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
