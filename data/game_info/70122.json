Chill Panda isn't a medical device but the techniques we use in the game draw on a broad spectrum of scientific studies and evidence. There are plenty of games on the market that address the issue of anxiety in adults but very few designed to help children under eight recognise and manage feelings of anxiety.<br/><br/><br/>We've spent the last two years in a global pandemic, which is scary for children. However, we knew, before Covid 19, that children were experiencing more anxiety at a younger age. There's a lot of well publicised research exploring why children are more anxious and  areas of children's mental health to be aware of. Mental health charity Place2Be says two thirds of 10/11 year olds worry all the time. It's shocking but there\u2019s plenty for them to worry about in the modern world.<br/><br/>By working closely with Dr Caroline Belcher, CGA has identified four pillars of relaxation. These pillars help refocus anxious children and are incorporated into activities in our game - giving children skills for life.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T20:46:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6b/e6b589eb12a049bf400975961344bee6.jpg", "website": "http://chillpanda.co.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["CGA Studio", "Onteca"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Onteca", "CGA Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
