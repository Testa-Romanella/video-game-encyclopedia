Destroy all the bugs using the colored bombs dropping from above. Sequences of four or more of the same color will clear that entire sequence. 21 levels of difficulty and 3 different speeds make this game easy to grasp, but harder to finish at the higher levels and speeds.<br/><br/>Have a friend join you in a 2 player game. Each player is given an identical board of bugs and bomb color sequence to keep things fair. Clearing 2 or more sequences in one drop will send penalty bombs to your opponent. The first to clear the bugs from their board wins!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86c/86c894dc18491a817e80c5790a2e1274_Llau1ZN.jpg", "website": "https://jasonsanford.github.io/bug-bomber/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jason Sanford"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Family"], "publishers": ["Jason Sanford"], "esrb_rating": null}
