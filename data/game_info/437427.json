Not much is known about the village, but its citizens believe that those who are brought there are chosen by the Light, and have arrived with a purpose in their heart.<br/><br/>Travelers often ended up staying and built their lives around the village. A Forge was built to gather ores and minerals from the mines nearby, and a Guildhall was constructed so that the High Mages could practice their devotion to the Light. Soon, the village of Tumulo grew strong and the Light grew ever stronger with it.<br/><br/>But what of the travelers with evil in their hearts? Can the Light truly shine for those lost in darkness? Can it dissolve the shadows that tread in their wake?<br/><br/>As the morning passes and the sun reaches it's apex, a newcomer sets foot in Tumulo, his hand on his dagger, a contract clutched in his hand, and a purpose that blurs the lines between Light and Darkness. This is his elegy.</em></p><p>Created\u00a0for the No Travel Game Jam hosted by the official RPG Maker forums.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit the official Elegy Game Thread on RPG Maker Web!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:44:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad748d97059303357355866c7726c9bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sleepless Alien Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
