The bouncy soft pieces pile up, creating a unique play field that you stack your pieces on.  Think of it as squishy Tetris.<br/><br/>The game has a chill paced zen-mode that goes infinitely long as long as you don't fill the board too full.  The other mode, challenge mode, starts going faster as you match pieces and has a timer you have to constantly increase by matching pieces.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-12T10:46:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abbda7dd94c0a955f16dbc944b0e1ed9.jpg", "website": "http://jellyblocksgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creative Cog Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Creative Cog"], "esrb_rating": null}
