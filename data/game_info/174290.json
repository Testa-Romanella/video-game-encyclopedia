This game uses Boid's flocking, magnetism and repulsion.</p><p>I had no previous experience with Unity before entering this competition. This was a fun challenge and I have learnt a lot about Unity and Boid's flocking.</p><p>The idea of this game it eat fish that are the same size as you. When you eat enough fish you grow in size. If you get too close to a fish it will run away from you if you can eat it and if its bigger than you it will chase you.<br/></p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>Use the mouse to select the options on the menus.</p><p>WASD to move around once in game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/7254e4123016adc84e07258a10a02c20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["fennec"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
