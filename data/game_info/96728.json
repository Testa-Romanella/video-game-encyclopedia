And you can't use a door\u00a0if you leave any of your friendly Orange Jellies behind! But you can leave behind any Bad Apples you might find.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Use the Arrow Keys or WASD to move. If you get stuck, in a puzzle just\u00a0press ENTER to restart it. Hold TAB and press left or right to cycle through the puzzles.\u00a0(Backspace to restarts the\u00a0 game.)</p>\n<p>I did not get as many puzzles done as I would have liked, but I hope you enjoy what is there.\r\n(P.s. the puzzles loop back around to the start once you have completed them all.)</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for time, I hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>Rate this LD42 game\u00a0here:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/orenji-shima-orange-jelly-puzzle-island<br/></p>\n<p><em>I made a last minute edit, i fixed a bug where puzzles could still be\u00a0completed if you fell off the level. I'm having a hard time getting onto the Ludum Dare site, so hopefully putting the edit here will be good enough.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f22/f227679a9f5cebbed94d6cd6d2f01a8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tekugare"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
