I was planning to release the game in browser but I didn't know that Itch.io have file size limit. I'm really sorry about that it's my first time releasing my game on the public I tried to lower the resolution and removing some props in the game and other stage to reach the file size required. So I decided that the browser version will be the demo and windows build will be the final build of the project as of the meantime it will be free to play but it will be monetize once the game is complete if you consider donating it I will give you the steam key once I release it on steam as appreciation thanks and have fun.</p>\n<p>Surviving Days is a third person shooter game where you need to survive from waves of zombie or other survivor for the limited food and water in the game. Game features include Crafting system to craft your weapon and Ammo as well as your food, drinks and your potion to heal yourself<br/>It has injury system where if you fall or get in a certain damage you will get injured reducing your movement speed to cure this you need to craft your medicine</p>\n<p>Surviving system. Not only the zombie and your fellow survivor need to watch for you need to check you hunger and thirst if don't eat and drink clean water you will die in hunger or drought not only that the weather is going to kill you if you stay outside during winter you need to setup camp to warm yourself.</p>\n\n<p>this is a work in progress project if you like the game so far, please do consider on donating to help the game progress thank you and have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T12:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5c/a5c20dea35074f0ba8f2eeca5f748489.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KeLsGaming23"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
