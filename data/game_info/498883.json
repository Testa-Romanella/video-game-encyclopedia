All the caves are made procedurally so they are different every time (so if you loose, try again!). You start only with\u00a03 lives and there is a permadeath, so choose wisely upgrades from the shop!<br/><br/><strong>How many golden gems can you collect</strong>? Post the screenshot down below! :)<br/></p>\n<p>This games was made in 7 days\u00a0for the VimJam with jam focus on \"collectables\" and a theme \"there and back\".<br/>For collectables I decided to go for the gems that are crucial in this game since you need them in order to buy upgrades and proceed.<br/>For the theme \"there and back\"\u00a0 the player need to collect the golden gem and carry it back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first time with procedural generation, so be understanding!
