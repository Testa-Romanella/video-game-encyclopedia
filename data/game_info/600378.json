Because why write funny jokes when you can just copy other people's, right?<br/><br/>\u2022 Multiple choices that affect the story, such as your gender, your hobbies, and whether or not you're naked in 50% of the scenes!<br/><br/>\u2022 A deadly minigame that is similar to, but legally distinct from, Wheel of Fortune!<br/><br/>\u2022 Three different endings, one of which is totally super secret and hard-to-find!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T02:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c092c13c0b01b494febe174f2919914.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Rabbit, Deer, You"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rabbit, Deer, You"], "esrb_rating": null}
