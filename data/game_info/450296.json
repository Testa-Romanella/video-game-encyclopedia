What you are sure of is whoever built these motors didn't look after them. They keep breaking almost as soon as you've repaired them. If you're going to get out of here you'll need to repair them as fast as you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Going up?</strong>\u00a0is the thirteenth chapter in my\u00a0<strong>One day at a time</strong>\u00a0series.\u00a0The series\u00a0was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:</p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts?
