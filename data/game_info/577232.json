'think you can be promoted? Finish the job before time runs out so you can pass to the next test!</p>\n<p>Quick Tip : </p>\n<p>\r\nKeyboard (arrows, a/w/s/d, ctrl, p, space).</p>\n<p>Level 2 : in the yellow/black zone, \"ctrl\" changes the lights; the green light tells you where the device will move in the upper area.</p>\n<p>Level4 (html version) : If it has paint on it, do not drop the paint roller twice on the floor. To unlock level5, enter this password in the level select menu: carpet cleaner x2, paint roller x2, paint bucket (cc, cc, pr, pr, pb), press ctrl.</p>\n<p>Boss level : there's no way to know where the robot will shoot; a good place to stand appears in the screenshot but keep moving.</p>\n<p>Pressing \"P\" or \"space\" pauses the game; write the password to replay your favorite level.</p>\n<p>Bug :</p>\n<p>If your player keeps moving on its own or freezes, tap the left ctrl (release the object you're holding first).</p>\n<p>Level4 (html version) : sometimes, pausing the game makes a black screen; restart the level.</p>\n<p>Level5 (html version) : press ctrl to charge water and ctrl again to stop charging it. Before entering the elevator, enter the bottle first, then the carpet cleaner; it'll allow you to clean the water left on the floor because another bug makes you spray automaticly when picking the water bottle. You must not leave any water on the floor.</p>\n<p>Boss level (html version. Stage : level2) : the screen blinks; not good if you're sensitive to flash but playable.</p>\n<p>Level 8 : if you give fuel while another customer waits for the fuel pump, that customer could lose patience. You can even win while doing nothing... If the character gets stuck in the fuelpump : restart the level (html version).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMade with  GameMaker (1.4)<br/>\r\nMusic made with \r\nBeepBox.<br/>\r\nSoundFX made with \r\nSFXR.<br/>\n<br/>Have Fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T08:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccc/cccdea6d6b1274b6e781fc91f8191267.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["PixelItchio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
