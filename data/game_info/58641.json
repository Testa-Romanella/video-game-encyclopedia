It takes place around the holiday season, at the local branch of Sigmund Corp where Eva &amp; Neil are employed.<br/><br/>The whole thing is pretty lighthearted (including a nod to Johnny\u2019s story from To the Moon), so don\u2019t expect much drama. c: Although, it does touch on a notable aspect of their job that I avoided to show in To the Moon, as it would\u2019ve distracted from the main story then.<br/><br/>It\u2019s not much, but I hope you guys enjoy it! Consider it a free DLC, heheh.<br/><br/>If you could help spread the word to others who\u2019d played To the Moon and let them know that this exists, it\u2019d be much appreciated as well!\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-17T08:17:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ee7/ee70b54f559841a786009b19420a09f9.jpg", "website": "http://freebirdgames.com/2013/12/31/to-the-moon-holiday-special-releas/", "rating": 4.12, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 10}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Freebird Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
