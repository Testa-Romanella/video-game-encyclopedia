While sweeping the dorms you somehow managed to get yourself into the final test for your apprenticeship - which would be nice and well and all were it not for the fact that you started your training two weeks ago and know literally nothing about the subject.<br/>And what is that final test, you ask? Well, it is the Maze of Madness, of course. And it deserves that name. Because it is literally designed to drive you mad. So good luck getting out of there without loosing your marbles.<br/><br/>Dungeon Crawlers are a staple of classic gaming. The first game of the genre was created in 1975 and throughout the 1980s and 1990s the genre enjoyed great success. This game is a loveletter to the genre, with a little twist, of course.<br/>First, there is no combat. Rather, the entire game is about exploration and puzzle solving. Each maze is randomly generated and requries you to mix and match various alchemical elements to complete the labyrinth. Of course these elements must be found first and more often than not traps make that job a lot more difficult. A ticking clock adds pressure to the mix and if time runs out you will end up going insane. Luckily you are provided with a map of each maze and maybe, just maybe, you can find a few upgrades to make navigation easier.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Procedurally generated mazes - No playthrough will ever be the same<br/></li><li>Simple but addictive gameplay - explore, mix and match<br/></li><li>Modern QOL features to help you navigate - maps, upgrades and tooltips<br/></li><li>Completely playable with the mouse - keyboard movement is an option<br/></li><li>Wonderful music to keep you engaged - Composed by Aron Ben Elal</li></ul><br/>Enjoy this nice little throwback over and over again. You are the Alchemist's Apprentice and if you survive this test, you maybe can drop that 'Apprentice' from your title.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-25T10:39:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48b/48be85409129fc880147c475cede7535.jpg", "website": "http://www.ermedia.at", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ERMedia"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
