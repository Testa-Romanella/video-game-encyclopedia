They will definitely be grateful and not demanding in the least.</p>\n<p>Shoot crates with your claw to add them to your train. When you pass a town, you drop off your back train to be unloaded in town. You're going to have to use the switching tracks to rearrange the cars in your train to get the right car at the back when you pass town. Press space when you see the purple arrows. Then press space again when you see the red insert indicator. Slow down your train with S to let the car catch up with you. Or do a full loop and drive over top of it to hitch the car up. That might work (it's kind of unintended, but maybe?).</p>\n<p>Made everything myself with Unity, Blender, Paint.net</p>\n<p>Code if you want:\u00a0https://github.com/TyLanger/RailCourier</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:12:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/232/23222a68de04f9a11f574b60e61bbceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Solrun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
