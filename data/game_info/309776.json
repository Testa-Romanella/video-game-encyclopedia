The game offers a range of different locations including urban environments, race tracks, and off-road routes. Driving in VR mode is optional.<br/><br/>The project is powered by an original vehicle physics engine designed for professional applications. It was developed by Raving Bots, a Polish indie studio.Driving school<br/>Improve your driving skills. Learn the principles of eco-driving and hone your driving technique. A range of specially designed training scenarios will lead you to perfection.<br/><br/>Racing<br/>Prepare yourself for a high realism and an extreme level of difficulty. There will be no driving assistance systems (unless they exist in real vehicles). You've been warned.<br/><br/>Research testbed<br/>Communicate with the simulation using a convenient API. Conduct a series of experiments and collect results easily. eXpanSIM is a modern tool for engineers, designers, Artificial Intelligence researchers working on autonomous vehicles and more.<br/><br/>Vehicles<br/>Currently available vehicles:<br/><br/><ul><li> a city car,<br/></li><li> a race car,<br/></li><li> a pickup,<br/></li><li> a limousine,<br/></li><li> a van,<br/></li><li> a city bus,<br/></li><li> an intercity bus,<br/></li><li> a lorry (with a semitrailer or a tanker),<br/></li><li> an off-road truck,<br/></li><li> a fire truck.</li></ul><br/>Vehicle models have right-hand and left-hand traffic variants as well. We are constantly expanding the collection of available vehicles. In the near future, the drones will be added.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/>To fully experience the potential of the simulator, it is recommended to use a steering wheel with pedals. The game supports popular VR equipment such as HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.Work in progress<br/>The project is currently in closed beta testing.
