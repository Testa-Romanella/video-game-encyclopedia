Although the manga universe has events in other countries, the main story of <strong>HEREGES</strong> takes place mainly in Japan through connected characters.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Life was peaceful in <strong><em>Okinawa</em></strong> after local delinquents ceased the violent war between schools thanks to the courage of a criminal named <strong><em>Nathaniel Hope</em></strong> who defeated his nemesis <strong><em>Yamazaki</em></strong>, the chairman of the juvenile crime tribunal. Unfortunately, peace did not last for long.</p>\n<p>One year after the suicide of <strong><em>Chihiro</em></strong>, Nathaniel's girlfriend and daughter of Nagisawa's principal, a mysterious group called <strong><em>The Circle</em></strong> sacrifices mankind in a bloody event waiting for <strong><em>Ubermensch</em></strong>, the messenger\u00a0of the new apocalypse.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game you control <strong>Sayuri Sakura</strong>, the president of the Nagisawa student council. Despite her prepotency, Sayuri is a fragile girl who cares more about others than herself\u00a0and will do anything to keep her school safe, even if she needs the help of people she hates.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>The biggest overworld to explore in a RPGmaker game yet.</li><li>An original, DRM free experience.</li><li>Straight to the point, no<em> fanservice</em>.</li><li>Over more than 100 bosses to kill.</li><li>Demons speak in deutsch and italian.<br/>\n<em>\n</em></li><li>Dynamic difficulty based on distance.</li><li>Fast travel through local checkpoints.</li><li>Realistic, fast pacing combat.</li><li>Over 12 survivors to be rescued and recruted.</li><li>In-game\u00a0achievement system.</li><li>Funny password system.</li><li>True 16-bit visuals.</li><li>Experimental soundtrack.*</li><li>And more...!</li></ul>\n<p><em>*The material present in the prototype is a third-party demonstration and will not remain in the final version.</em></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>HEREGES</strong> is a game in development.\u00a0In the current version, you can:</p>\n<ul><li>Watch the partial game intro.</li><li>Explore your main hideout, the Safehouse.</li><li>Explore the first area of the game.</li><li>Initiate fights against human enemies.</li></ul>\n<p>The full version will be commercialized (no price defined) and this prototype may get updated until the demo version.\u00a0If you are interested in the project, please follow the developement through my social media.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T11:22:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/949/949e575897893c6387420c1e32e3cffc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheMorganah"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
