Bounty hunters from across the known universe compete annually for eternal glory and a coveted $2,000,001 space-credit reward. In ChargeShot, each player is armed with a Pulsar Cannon, capable of powerful blasts that bounce off walls and instantly destroy any life forms they touch; an Energy Shield, which can reflect Pulsar blasts and knock opponents into dangerous hazards; and a standard-issue jetpack for traversing the battlefield with deadly speed and grace. In a fascist, dystopian galaxy where humans are the rats of the stars, yetis have mastered space travel, and Goopies are Girblons, you'll assume control of one of many ass-kicking, elite bounty-hunters. Play against humans, hone your skills against AI, or dominate the leaderboards of the single-player quest to become the best professional bounty hunter in the known universe. With achievements, character backstories, and a slathering of unlockable characters, ChargeShot's got what your butt's been craving.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Features</strong> <br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Up to 4 player competitive matches</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Distinct game modes</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>12 Unique levels that affect gameplay</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Add Bots into matches</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Single player campaign</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Unlockable characters and levels</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Leaderboards (Steam version)</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Achievements (Steam version)</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Trading cards (Steam version)</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Dynamic music<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tSteam key included in purchase \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tFull 4 player controller support and custom key mapping\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/><br/>Download the OST for free: http://gloomprophet.bandcamp.com/\r\n\t</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/23628d7ff538556ca4efcd8a41339f8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CowboyColor"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
