A bit of what differentiates itself from the first title in the series, Hikikomori No Chuunibyou, is this successor's less realistic approach and more atmospheric vibe. Levels are once again open-ended with the story directing the player.<br/></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Open-ended levels with story-focused progression</li><li>Various platforming challenges and puzzles</li><li>Unlimited continues and frequent checkpoints</li><li>Pixel-art graphics and electronic soundtrack</li><li>Supports Xbox 360 Controller (recommended)</li></ul>\n<p>Like all of my other games, I developed it entirely on my own as well as having had composed the soundtrack in its entirety. Also, the\u00a0 soundtrack can be found through this link.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab5b8eca7ac7c4e2db86c536e29476cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blaze Epic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
