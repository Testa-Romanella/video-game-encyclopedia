It is unfortunate that I wasn't able to do more. I learned a lot of things and did a game on Unity on my first time!<br/><br/>I learned about singletons, game manager, animation, scripting and creating animations, animating via code. Managed to learn a lot of great hings about Blender too. <br/><br/>I will come back to it a bit later since I would like to tell a story with this game.<br/><br/>The theme \"A lot\" is implemented by the player having to go through multiple \"dimensions\".<br/><br/>Heavily inspired by\u00a0 adventure games like Penumbra, The Backrooms and the Silent Hill series.
