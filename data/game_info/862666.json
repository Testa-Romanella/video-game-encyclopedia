That night they had a very strange dream. They woke up on an island floating in the void. A beautiful soft voice spoke to Marin, saying \"Hello Marin, my name is Astella, the spirit of every wish upon a star that has ever been made. I saw how hard you worked today in the garden and wanted to give you a dream where all your work pays off. Time here is sped up, a day will pass by every 10 seconds, plants only take a week to grow and you can eat all the fruit and veg you like! Stay a while, life's short but dreams are forever.\"\r\nGameplay\r\nThere is no goal in this game. Just do a little bit of platforming to find the 4 seed dispensing pipes and collect all 4 seed types(only 3 in the jam version due to a mistake in the last hour or two of the jam), then you can garden to your heart's content. Each season  the seeds will produce a different variety of fruit so if you want to try and get 1 of every fruit you should end up with a total of 16 unique items. <br/><br/>I had a lot more planned for this project so if you'd like to see that, let me know and if you're feeling generous and really want more please leave a tip on the itch page. If there's enough interest I'll happily add more to this because it's very fun to work on.\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Move: wasd or left stick<br/>Camera: mouse or right stick(adjust sensitivity in the pause menu<br/>Pickup/drop: left mouse, left bumper or X<br/>Eat/Plant: right mouse, right bumper or Y<br/>Jump: space or  A <br/>Run: Shift or A<br/>Zoom: mouse scroll or dpad up/down<br/>ESC: Menu<br/><br/><strong>Note</strong>: Button names are for Xbox controller Layout, I think it should work with other controllers though if you press the button in the same place as the listed Xbox button.<br/><br/>Made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 51</p>\n<p>Made with Godot,  font used is Alphakind, 3D made in Blender, Music and SFX made with FL Studio and Audacity, textures made with Krita</p>\n<br/>NOTE if you are rating this game for lucum dare you should be downloading\u00a0MarinsDreamGardenLD51_Windows.zip, Unfortunately I forgot to backup the4 project files before working on Post Jam content so the jam version is limited to windows.\r\n\r\nThe Dream Garden awaits, I hope you have a lovely time!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:50:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f89/f89662591816a1d054c1e8a351fe99cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Breog\u00e1n Hackett"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
