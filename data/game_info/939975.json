I thought the lame jam was a good opportunity to learn it. If my first project with this new tool turned\u00a0out to be a dud I could just say that it was meant to fit the \"lame\" concept of this jam.\u00a0But using it is even easier than I imagined. It only took me a few hours to learn how to use Bitsy and to make this game. It's still kind of lame though. It just takes a couple of minutes to play and the implementation of the theme is lacking. But again lame is the name of the game in this jam!</p>\n<p>The premise is simple: You're a teddy bear scouring Joe's huge garden for toxic weeds to save his plants.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>W, A, S, D</strong> or <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> to walk</p>\n<p>Walk into white sprites to interact</p>\n<p><strong>Enter,</strong><strong>\u00a0Space, </strong>or <strong>Movement Keys</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>to\u00a0Progress Dialogue<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T05:28:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9deb62f0d8fd98fcbe62d76da1b29774.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
