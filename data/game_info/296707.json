The goal is to survive, equipped with 4 gadgets and a main battle weapon,\u00a0 as long as possible against endless enemy waves.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Blazing Steel is my graduation project for university. I worked for 5 months on it and it was a lot of fun but also a lot of work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I hope you enjoy it :D</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Player Tanks</strong><br/>The player can choose between 4 different tanks. Their stats vary in 3 different categories: Driving, Shooting, and Health. The first is average in all 3 categories, the 3 others are bad, good and average in one category.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gadget System</strong><br/>Each tank can be equipped with different gadgets, which can make the fights easier. There are many different gadgets and each is unique in their behavior.\u00a0 The gadget slot can also be equipped with stat boosts for armor, damage, gadget cooldown, and score increase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weapons</strong><br/>The 8 different weapons in the game are changeable by driving over a barrel changing station.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enemy Tanks</strong><br/>Currently, there are 4 different enemies. Two of them are weak but fast and are equipped with close-range weapons. One is a standard battle tank, slower than the first two but tougher and the last one is an artillery tank, shooting at the player from afar.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Spawn System</strong></p>\n<p>It is a wave-based system, where every 5 waves the enemies are getting stronger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Levels</strong></p>\n<p>Currently there are 4 different maps + 1 tutorial map.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Game mode</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Endless survival against enemies who grow in strength and number over time. (Every 5 waves)</p>\n<p><strong>Highscore</strong><br/>By killing enemy tanks and building up a multiplier the player can increase its score.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Options</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Controller Support\u00a0</li><li>Widescreen Support</li><li>Graphical settings (Aspect Ratio, Windowed Mode, Overall look)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<p>The game may receive future updates regarding balancing, fixing bugs and overall polishing, maybe even some content updates too. But I don\u00b4t know how much time I have for that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Balancing</strong></p>\n<p>The game is not completely balanced. It is a lot of work to do that and I need player feedback to find the right values in most cases. Balancing involves the costs and duration of gadgets, the damage of the different projectiles, the stats of the 4 player tanks (health, driving, shooting), the stats of the enemy tanks and the increase of those values based on the wave.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OLD DEVLOG</strong></p>\n<p>This devlog contains all previous updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42b/42bc1c3fc8c153b398a0ea3b59734206.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solo Byte Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
