Can he actually do something to free himself?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beware: Even though there is a plot involved and a puzzle to solve for the story to unfold, this product is intended as a small stand alone horror experience.<br/> <br/>It is not, and does not mean to be, a traditional full game.</p>\n<p>Be warned: randomized jumpscares galore!</p>\n<p>T.N.T.S.: The Stairs takes inspiration from \"SCP-087\" by \"Zaeyde\": http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-087<br/>Content relating to the SCP Foundation, including the SCP Foundation logo, is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0.
