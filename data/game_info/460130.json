There's a lot of graphics and areas that are incomplete and the effects are pretty lame as they were becoming massive time sinks, but there are still two effects to find and some areas to explore. What more could a dreamer ask for!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Due to time pressures I've not had a chance to validate that VR support still works as it should. I deprioritised this as I figured most users won't have a VR headset - if you do have one and it does/doesn't work, let me know. Likewise if you find any issues please drop me a line. Note that in my own testing I found that after quite a lot of game time, Firefox would start consuming a lot of system memory. Chrome doesn't seem to do this.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T05:24:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b226437de3cd02bafe0cde33cf7046f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["blonk"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
