{"id": 780509, "slug": "six-seconds", "name": "Six Seconds", "name_original": "Six Seconds", "description": "<p>The rules are simple: you have six seconds for the task in front of you. Some have an objective you need to complete in six seconds. Some need you to stop something from occurring for the whole six seconds. Either way, you can complete it with only a mouse or touchscreen. Figure out what to do on your turn, and do it: you only get two chances, and the games can get harder and harder.</p>\n<p>This is a small demo which I refer to as version 0.0.0 as, while playable, it lacks many of the features I would like for it to have. Currently, it has 7 of the first planned 30 minigames, in 3 difficulty levels, which you can play one after another. Alongside more minigames, the next update will have single device multiplayer. (Please sanitize your input device before and after playing.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T11:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe2/fe257e5fd75da3eaf93ab1a13f66a5d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Coruscare"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
