It is a horror styled adventure game where the player must find out what happened to the locals of their village one night after they mysteriously disappear.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>(WARNING there are some flickering/flashing lights.)<br/></p>\n<p>This demo is for my personal portfolio project. It is called Misery and it is a first-person turned based survival horror game. I am creating this game inside of Unreal Engine and the design, scripting, and some of the odds and ends are either done by me or are customized assets from the marketplace. Many things are subject to change and more than likely they will. The game is missing some features, opening cutscenes, etc. but those will hopefully be added at a later date. I just wanted to finally get something in the hands of players. Currently the game is only playable in Windows, but I\u00a0do hope to package a Linux and Mac OS version eventually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a alpha demo so there is currently no combat in the game; although the player can die. As I am teaching myself Unreal Engine after work the updates may be a little slower to roll out.\u00a0While the options menu currently doesn't work I hope to get this fixed soon!</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing!
