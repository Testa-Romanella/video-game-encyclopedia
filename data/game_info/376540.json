(and everything else)</em> was created for Ludum Dare 20, and you can see the original description below. I'm really happy that someone in the comments got the La La Land reference!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Original description for Ludum Dare 20:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I'm a first time Ludum Darer. In fact, this is the first game I'm publishing! I use Game Maker, so there's only the Windows version. The game has no sound or music due to lack to time. The graphics are simple but all the informative effects are there, so you won't be confused.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is simple, but challenging. It's a reflex type of game that uses the keyboard and the mouse. It's about the old man in the cave that gives people things. I didn't have time to include levels or anything, but I'm happy with how it turned out, and making is was lots of fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b70/b705f432405814bf5a0c51fd5b6dc628.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petzi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
