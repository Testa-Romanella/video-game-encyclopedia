You are in command of the German Army Group North , tasked with striking through the Baltic states all the way to Leningrad, the cradle of Bolshevism. It is essential for German Panzer Corps to seize Leningrad quickly, before Wehrmacht offensive is inevitably slowed down by the steady flow of Red Army reinforcements, worsening weather, logistics of fuel supply (can be turned off), and terrain filled with forests and swamps.<br/><br/><br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/><br/>+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup.<br/><br/>+ Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.<br/><br/>+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.<br/><br/>+ Good AI: Instead of just attacking on direct line towards the target, the AI opponent balances between strategic goals and smaller tasks like encircling nearby units.<br/><br/>+ Settings: Various options are available to alter the look of the gaming experience: Change difficulty level, hexagon size, Animation speed, choose icon set for units (NATO or REAL) and cities (Round, Shield, Square, block of houses), decide what is drawn on the map, and much more.<br/><br/><br/>In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you want to test this WWII game, a free 20-turn version is also available<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Privacy Policy (full text on website and app menu): No account creation is possible, the made-up username used in the Hall of Fame listings is not tied to any account and does not have password. Location, personal, or device identifier data is not used in any way. In the case of crash the following non-personal data is sent (vie web-form using ACRA library) to allow quick fix: Stack trace (code which failed), Name of the App, Version number of the App, and Version number of the Android OS.

The campaigns are based on the time-tested gaming mechanics TBS (turn-based strategy) enthusiasts are familiar with from both the classic PC war games and legendary tabletop board games. I want to thank the fans for all the well thought-out suggestions over the years which have allowed these campaigns to improve at a much higher rate than what any solo indie developer could dream of. If you have feedback about this board game series please use email, this way we can have a constructive back and forth chat without the limits of the store's comment system. In addition, because I have huge number of projects on multiple stores, it\u2019s just not sensible to spend handful of hours each day going through hundreds of pages spread all over the Internet to see if there is a question somewhere -- just send me an email  and I will get back to you.
