{"id": 25333, "slug": "double-dribble", "name": "DOUBLE DRIBBLE", "name_original": "DOUBLE DRIBBLE", "description": "<p>\n      Double Dribble, the first 5-on-5, full-court home-basketball game, is \n      pure hoops action at its finest. While still a surprisingly accurate \n      basketball game for its time, the frantic action keeps you on your toes \n      as your players run from one end of the court to the other. Choose from \n      a handful of teams and multiple levels of difficulty as you take on the \n      computer alone or challenge a friend and see who has the better skills. \n      Take the ball and sink shots from locations all over the court, or get \n      in your opponent\u2019s face and do your best to block the shot. Better yet, \n      drive the lane and rock the rim to see one of the game\u2019s trademark \n      slam-dunk cut scenes! He shoots, he scores!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
