You will have to use your imagination in order to avoid different traps that you may face during your adventure. Try not to die, for if you do, you start over from the beginning (like old school games)!<br/></p>\n<p>Face the different environments with various enemy types throughout. As you progress the labyrinths become more bigger, complex and deadly. You don't have any weapons, but you can run and jump your way out of trouble! The game has been developed in Unreal Engine 4 and assets have been build in Blender, so nothing is procedurally generated. <br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy the experience in early access on December 2020 only on Windows PC!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T05:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cad/cad7b1114fce752d5ad2b171477c3cd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexandru.ion"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
