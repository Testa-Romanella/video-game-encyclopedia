It breathes in ragged growls. The city cries. The city slides its slender fingers across its concrete skin and drives its fingernail deep beneath its ribs. The city bleeds. You are Tr\u1ea7n C\u00f4ng Lan, young second generation immigrant of the great capital city.\u00a0\u00a0Life has not been kind to you or your recently departed parents, and yet you still wake up every day and perform the same tasks you did the day before. The city warps and twists in front of you. No one else seems to notice it. You hear it creak slowly at night. You leave your small appartment and prepare for another day. You kick the city with every step you take on its pavements. You curse the city with your every breath. You look up and gaze at the bright purple smog, dancing jitters in the grey-blue sky. You sigh and go do what you have to.</p>\n<p>Adrien Dittrick - programming, co-design, co-writing</p>\n<p>June Flower - art, music stealing and audio, co-design, co-writing<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T11:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b08/b08809dbce3f7541c028caf9720e0a41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["adriendittrick"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
