Humanity succeeds in preserving the race by building Matryoshka, a\u00a0 worlds simulations facility: large environments contained in each room to stock human beings. A great starting point for humanity to survive but they soon realize that Matryoshka won\u2019t last longer on the hostile Earth and get prepared to live in space. Unexpectedly, Matryoshka collapses. The evacuation protocol gets started and the player remains stuck inside. The objective is to walk through the testing simulation rooms to reach the shuttle and hopefully evacuate the Earth.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: When the play start, wait a bit for the \"Start Game\" to load (the hovering effect will appear if the game is loaded).</p>\n<p>Movement: WASD + Mouse<br/>Sprint: Left SHIFT<br/>Jump: SPACEBAR<br/>Discard: DEL + Mouse click on item (press DEL again to close the discard action)<br/>Action (Open doors, etc...): E<br/>Flashlight ON/OFF: F<br/>Heal: Q<br/>Pause Game: ESCAPE</p>\n\n<p>Team Name: Team Caballo</p>\n<p>Team Members:\u00a0 Francesco Maria Bernabei<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alessandro Fucci\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Roberta Fucci</p>\n<p>Special thanks for the testing:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marco Panariello</p>\n<p>Game Name: Matryoshka</p>\n<p>Name of submission: TeamCaballo_Matryoshka.zip</p>\n<p>Assets credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Unreal Marketplace</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Modular Sci Fi Office -\u00a0Ruslan Nazirov<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Movie Theater Pack - Realistic Movie Theater Props -\u00a0Nimikko<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Stage Vol 1 -\u00a03DAssetLibrary</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sketchfab<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Old electric metal box on the wall\" (https://skfb.ly/6rzAw) by 3dhdscan is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<em>\"Audio Mixer\" (https://skfb.ly/MLDu) by Rayan is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).<br/></em>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Percussion bass guitar\" (https://skfb.ly/6REXO) by Kanade_Tatibana is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Music Tape\" (https://skfb.ly/6vUMZ) by Philip Osborne is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Quixel</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Old plywood (surface material)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Solid wood parquet floor (surface material)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Stucco wall (surface material)</p>\n<p>Splice<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Footstep Bible - Blastwave FX<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 AAA Game Character - Human AI - Epic Stock Media<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Hybrid Game Sounds -\u00a0Epic Stock Media<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Cybernetica -\u00a0Field and Foley<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Noisy Doors -\u00a0Big Room Sound<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Workspace SFX\u00a0-\u00a0Field and Foley<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Disco Fries' Sample Pack\u00a0-\u00a0Splice<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Blockbuster Trailer\u00a0-\u00a0Epic Stock Media<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Asylum\u00a0-\u00a0Epic Stock Media<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Sci-FI Vol. 1\u00a0-\u00a0Blastwave FX<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Morse Code\u00a0-\u00a0Blastwave FX<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Game Voices\u00a0-\u00a0Epic Stock Media<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Mouth Sounds\u00a0-\u00a0Big Room Sound<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Foley Finisher\u00a0-\u00a0Foley Finisher<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Shwex - Collision -\u00a0Billegal Sounds<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Montclarion Piano FX -\u00a0Soundiron<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Electro Coil Diaries vol.1 -\u00a0Headphaze<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Tape - Soundiron<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Essential Interiors -\u00a0Big Room Sound<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0HD Source Part 1 -\u00a0Epic Stock Media</p>\n<p>Open Air<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0IR R1 Nuclear Reactor Hall\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Starring the Unreal Mannequin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T06:06:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60b/60b5f7f314c5f101b88f626d085b3a86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fmbvisuals", "fucciroberta", "Alax00"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
