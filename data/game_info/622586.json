{"id": 622586, "slug": "red-algorithm", "name": "Red Algorithm", "name_original": "Red Algorithm", "description": "<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>It's quite simple. Pick a hero, pick a weapon, and go fight the monsters! Level up and choose new perks to become stronger and kill monsters even faster. Look for bonuses on the map and try to survive as long as you can.<br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> 85+ perks<br/></li><li> 9 weapons classes<br/></li><li> 55+ weapons<br/></li><li> 10+ weapon upgrades<br/></li><li> 5 types of consumables<br/></li><li> 6 heroes<br/></li><li> 15 monsters<br/></li><li> 7 possible injuries<br/></li><li> 50+ achievements<br/></li><li> Stats</li></ul><h3>Perks</h3><br/>The RPG system here is not complicated; you get one new perk every new level. <br/><br/><br/><br/>There are many of them, you pick 1 out of random 3 in most cases. Many perks have side-effects that can ruin the whole game if picked for the wrong weapon/hero/build. Some perks are very specific and will benefit you only in a particular situation or with a particular setup. This RPG system is simple, yet it provides a lot of freedom in character building. You can make a tanky man, a fast woman with high DPS, a hero that relies on splash, or try to construct a balanced character that is good for every situation.<h3>Weapons</h3><br/>You can find a weapon box every few minutes and choose a weapon out of 3 offered randomly. There are many different weapons to choose from.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A weapon can belong to 1 of 9 general classes:<br/><br/><ul><li> Pistols<br/></li><li> Shotguns<br/></li><li> SMGs<br/></li><li> Rifles<br/></li><li> ARs<br/></li><li> Plasma<br/></li><li> MGs<br/></li><li> Gauss<br/></li><li> Primitive</li></ul><br/>There are some weapons that belong to more than one class.<br/><br/>Be careful when picking a new weapon, as you will lose some of the habit from the previous one, and check that your hero level is equal to or higher than the weapon level. You can still use a high-level weapon, but you will be penalized.<br/><br/>If you are lucky, you can find a weapon upgrade and pick 1 of 3 random improvements for your gun (more damage, range, faster reload, etc.).<h3>Monsters</h3><br/>You will face 15 monsters on your journey, with a new type every 2 minutes. Monsters appear out of nowhere, and they are also created by spawners, which you should destroy as soon as possible if you don't want to be overwhelmed. Each monster in the game is unique and has different damage resistance. Some are fast, some are healthy, some can shoot, etc.<h3>Heroes</h3><br/>Choose 1 of 6 heroes, each with a unique bonus, starting perk, weapon, and a set of consumables (drones, grenades, turrets, first aid kits, and barricades).<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are 3 free and 3 premium heroes that you can unlock by purchasing DLCs. Premium heroes are the only non-free feature in the game, and they are not stronger than free heroes. By purchasing a DLC you help to support the game, which was created and is managed by just one indie developer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T03:12:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebe32c029e6fb6df6d249d7be82daa4e.jpg", "website": "https://redalgorithm.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 73, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flare Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flare Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
