Everything else Kris will make herself.</p>\n<p>Warning! Read this before you buy!\r\n</p>\n<p>If you follow me, you should know, that for now I create multiple short games with some sort of game mechanics in almost standard interface. It is literally a bunch of images, that appear in different circumstances and there is almost no weight gain. All my games are stuffing games. And for me the main value is that they are different. Different models, morphs, clothes, different style of interactions. Every game is an experiment. They are as they are. You can see in screenshots skinniest and fattest sprites. There is nothing more. Some people, such as me like such things and diversity. So if you are not into it, i ask you to understand and to forgive))\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T20:11:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad8/ad83fbe211789d63123c14969661592b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yuliya3k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
