I designed the game, created art assets for it, designed the beat clicking rhythm- everything but the programming was done by me. I got help and some guidance from my project partner who also programmed the game- Arooj Basit: https://aroojbasit.itch.io/</p>\n<p>I plan on completing my vision for the game after this initial release for the game jam, I just wanted to make it in time for now. If anyone is looking to collaborate on any projects, please feel free to contact me!<br/></p>\n<p>This game is completely made from scratch in 2 days! Saturday and Sunday!</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy this initial release!</p><p>Audio Used:\u00a0https://www.storyblocks.com/audio/stock/race-against-the-clock-346797559.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T04:24:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0d/d0d806c0dca6fa06717a2a2afb6a86b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sabrina Li"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
