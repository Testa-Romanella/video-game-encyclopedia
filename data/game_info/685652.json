RUSSIAN TRANSLATION COMING SOON***<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong> WISHLIST TODAY!</strong></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>\r\nIf you crossed a vampire, would you protect humanity or embrace the blood?\r\n<p>In Twice Reborn, Mark Delaware a teaching assistant, becomes a newly-turned vampire in a community forced to hide in plain sight. His mentor, Michelson, has trusted Mark to become the Enforcer: a feared arbiter who keeps the quarreling vampiric houses following the Code. When arson kills key vampires in the community, it's up to Mark to either embrace his blood or to find a way to--somehow--regain his humanity.<br/></p>\r\nThere Are Sacrifices to Make\r\n<p>Interacting with humans and vampires is a delicate balance. Not all appreciate Mark's decision and not all relationships can last. Some want him dead, others want him for their own. Mark's responses in the perilous community changes their reactions as well as the story's routes/endings.<br/></p>\r\nSurvive the Night\r\n<p>Satiate Mark's bloodlust, otherwise he may kill innocents.
