Armed with only a Roomba with a knife glued to it, attempt to pop all of your opponent's balloons before they pop yours.<br/></p><p>Controls: <br/></p><p>A -Turn left</p><p>D - Turn right</p><p>W - Move forward</p><p>S - Move in reverse</p><p>R - Take screenshot</p><p>Note: It's possible to play locally against a second player, but it requires a game-pad for player 2. This mode has not been tested as thoroughly as single player so if it breaks I apologize. If you are using a dual Shock 4 controller you'll need to download DS4Windows.</p><p>This game was made in 48 hours as part of Ludum Dare. If you are judging and want to give me a good score you can find my LD37 link <strong>HERE.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07aa55a01bdda127e7b3142a6ba220bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimmothySanchez"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
