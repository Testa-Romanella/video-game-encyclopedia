Fight against AI opponents or your friends via local co-op to determine who will come out on top this holiday season. The best part: 100% of proceeds from A Christmas Peril will be donated to local charity LOFT Community Services in Toronto, Canada.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPour some eggnog. Support a good cause. Have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Fun and frantic snowball fight action with simple controls. Jump, crouch and use high ground to find the perfect angle of attack.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Four holiday levels: a snow day in the Schoolyard, a calm sunset stroll through the forest, a contested suburban Cul-de-Sac, and a hectic blizzard.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Settings that let you customize just how action-packed the snowball fight will be: cruise through a relaxed skirmish or crank up the difficult and make every snowball a game changer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Snow provides unlimited ammo: ambush your enemies and try to avoid your friends in the crossfire, because snowballs don't care about friendly fire.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- 100% of proceeds will be donated to a local charity in Toronto, Canada. Celebrate the spirit of the holidays and help those less fortunate.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff4/ff4938a4ce5623bdf51c039687695a63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petar Markovich", "James Arkwright"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["James Arkwright", "Petar Markovich"], "esrb_rating": null}
