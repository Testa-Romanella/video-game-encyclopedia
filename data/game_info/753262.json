{"id": 753262, "slug": "trumpland", "name": "Trumpland", "name_original": "Trumpland", "description": "<p>Trumpland is a twitter simulation game about former President Donald J. Trump, who was elected to serve as the President of the United States from 2016-2020. During his tenure, one of his most popular methods of communication was through his Twitter account. His tweets were often very \"off-the-cuff\" and were the cause of much controversy. Sometimes he would tweet foreign policy announcements, other times he would retweet political opinions from other accounts in-line with his personal views. In the time that this game was originally created (2017) and now, Donald Trump has since been banned from Twitter for the reason of violating their Glorification of Violence policy. </p>\n<p>In this game, you take on the role of Trump. Your goal is to tweet the things that he did, in fact, tweet. However, you may be given draft tweets that he did not tweet. Real tweets come from a database of every tweet of Donald Trumps official twitter account. Fake tweets come from a collection of twitter bots meant to sound like Trump\u00a0OR from satire accounts.\u00a0Every time you tweet a\u00a0<strong>real tweet</strong>, you will gain followers and retweets. Every time you tweet a\u00a0<strong>fake tweet</strong> you will lose followers and get dislikes. You may, of course, choose to tweet nothing (<em>which may have been preferable throughout those 4 years in my opinion</em>).</p>\n<p>You may also get messages from people who follow you, which offer you an option to tweet a real or a fake tweet.\u00a0Selecting the real tweet will give you more followers, and selecting the fake tweet will cause you to lose followers.<br/></p>\n<p>To make sure there is no confusion, Donald Trump actually tweeted some of the tweets in this game. And he was President of the United States during some of them. Which is insane.\u00a0This game was originally made for a game design class at NYU in 2017. As such, tweets only date from 2017 and earlier. Unfortunately for the dignity of the United States, that is still enough content to embarrass the nation.</p>\n<p>This game was a collaborative effort with\u00a0https://github.com/athoug,\u00a0https://github.com/tqy202, and myself (https://github.com/mcgreentn)</p>\n<p>An earlier version of the game is a available on Athoug's website. It contained a WarioWare-style game mechanic which centered around the Tweet Menu and had 3 different minigames.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T10:43:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb47c15e1469f02765bc3efb8a94641c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChampChampChamp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
