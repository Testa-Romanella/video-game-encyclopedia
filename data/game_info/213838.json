That would be bad.\"</em> <br/><br/> For the last few years Kangai has been a wanderer, but his return to his hometown has triggered a series of deaths linked to his past. With a bit of less than gentle prodding, he joins a group of psychic teenagers who solve mysteries under the watchful eye of the government. The group goes undercover at a local university to investigate Kangai's history, but the sudden death of a professor sets them on a new course racing an old enemy for valuable information. <br/><br/> Take control of Kangai as you explore the campus, interrogate suspects, and unearth together the secrets behind the lies. Can you catch the murderer, or will the murderer catch you?</p>\n<p>Prequels:\u00a0Jisei\u00a0|\u00a0Kansei</p>\n<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Supernatural, mystery <br/><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Adventure, visual novel <br/><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux <br/><strong>Playtime:</strong> 8-9 hours (with voices on) <br/><strong>Rating:</strong> 13+ for depictions of crime scenes and blood<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Writing, programming:</strong> Ayu Sakata <br/><strong>Character design, art:</strong> M.
