(CANCELLED)", "description": "<ul><li>Music</li><li>Sound effects</li><li>A better background</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Why did I really cancel it?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to add a bunch of enemies (About 20) to the game. The enemeis you see in the game were relatively easy to make. However, the last enemy, the one that doesn't show up on the screen because it is in a blindspot, was REALLY hard for me to do. Since Godot can only have so many ways to make a game work, I couldn't do it. Specifically, I couldn't make the behavior of that enemy work.</p>\n\n<p>Well, that is all I wanted to say. Feel free to download this game to see what I was able to accomplish throughout my development of this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T02:30:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/929/929684d094e70b2f42c184ce21a9c00c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GameConDev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
