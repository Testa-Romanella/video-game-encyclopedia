Some SFX. Try to protect the spaceship/square and don't let it break. To make the game I used a small SDL-Base I made but that sadly broke the web build so I went back to the Old-SDL-Base which can be found in the GitHub repo linked somewhere below. This is the second installment of the Mini Jam series and kind of like a reboot to the very first one except simpler art and a little better of an idea. The next one will come soon as well.</p>\n<p>The Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Up Arrow - Move Up</li><li>Down Arrow - Move Down</li></ul>\n<p>It will be added to the following GitHub as well:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>C/C++ Game Dev</li></ul>\n<p>External Assets:</p>\n<ul><li>m5x7</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd8/bd860e6cc9b80197cbd6df161a86fc09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["DevHedronYT"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
