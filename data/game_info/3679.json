Enter your clan into the league and fight together to make your mark on the leaderboards. Nobody wants an empty trophy cabinet!<br />\nSlick Single Player Gameplay Too<br />\nStory Mode\u2019 adds a ton of variety by introducing physics based contraptions for the first time ever. A plethora of interesting machinery spices up the gameplay, and makes solo Worms\u2122 much more fun! The single\u2010player game isn\u2019t only about dealing death and destruction, it\u2019s also about negotiating tricky swinging rope bridges and rescuing friendlies from death defying traps! The player spends much more time playing, and much less time waiting for their A.I. opponent to take a shot.<br />\nAdditional hardware required for Remote Play.<br />\nUse of PSN and SEN account are subject to the Terms of Service and User Agreement and applicable privacy policy (see terms at sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/terms-of-service &amp; sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/privacy-policy). *Online multiplayer also requires a PlayStation\u00aePlus subscription.<br />\n1-4 players<br />\nNetwork Players 2-4<br />\nDUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br />\nRemote Play<br />\n1080p HD Video Output<br />\nOnline Play (Optional)<br />\nSoftware subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
