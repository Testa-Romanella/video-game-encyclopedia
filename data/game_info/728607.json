I could image it being kind of a revolutionary concept at the time and a technical feat to booth.</p>\n<p>Today, it's only a nice opportunity to impose a twist on it, projecting the once flat play field on a rounder shape with some nice shading. The original series went on to spawn some \"sexy\" clones to keep gamers interested, my remake will for now stop short of it ;)</p>\n<p>Play with WASD or touch controls (you'll find a basic touch pad in the bottom right), and drive your \"drawing point\" around. The goal is to \"reveal\" a percentage of the surface without running out of time. A poor design choiche put these infos on the back of the sphere, so you'll have to drag around with mouse or touch to view them.</p>\n<p>Enemies can bother you only when drawing new lines and can do no more than\u00a0setting you back a bit.</p>\n<p>In-game interface is minimal at best, when I'll be able to, I'll be back to polish and add some more mechanics like a life count and a boss enemy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T08:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/466/466a0ad4f343af231b4c7068ad1172e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ilBarbogio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
