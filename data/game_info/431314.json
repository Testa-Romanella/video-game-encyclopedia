Because we all know mountains have magical coin sacks flying around.\u00a0He didn't know exactly where they were, though. So he just decided to run around aimlessly. In bright daylight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's right! He didn't even go at night,\u00a0wich means that all the police are after him! You need to bring him to as many coin sacks as possible before he gets caught!<br/><br/>With the money you collected, you can buy cool upgrades such as:</p>\n<p>More Health! Higher Jumps! ... that's it. BUT they're still cool!!\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game was created during a Game Jam. (In 2 days). It was the very first Game Jam I ever participated in, so I hope it's not COMPETELY terrible!<br/>I might even update it in the future... who knows? ;)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>You can find my Youtube channel where I upload all of my\u00a0DevLogs here:<br/>\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmjXFVfYnwY3tJNEpvvFHQ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/462/4625fb1b053bb6bb2f5c379285835afe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ender"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
