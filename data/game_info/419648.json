I was inspired to look at the 2600 catalogue by Antonio Savona's great recent Activision ports, and thought this would be a *reasonably* simple port, plus it's a pretty fun and challenging game with some odd-looking sprites!<br/></p>\n<p>Each level consists of a different enemy type with varying attack patterns, simply clear all the enemies before your energy bar runs out to progress. As you progress the enemies will fire more often and faster, while keeping you guessing with their attack patterns.</p>\n<p>By default, you can hold down the fire button to autofire, and when you fire bullets they will follow your ship, allowing you to 'steer' them into enemies. Bullets will also drop more slowly. On the title screen you have the option to change these settings to make for a more difficult game.<br/></p>\n<p>You score points for each enemy hit, and also the enemy value (shown below) multipled by the amount of energy left (out of 80). PAL only at the moment, I'm afraid - I'm right on the edge of running out of raster time so would need to re-think for NTSC.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Source Code (KickAssembler)</p>\n<p><strong>Levels:</strong></p>\r\nNoEnemy (Yes, really!)Points (1st time round)<br/>1Hamburger20<br/>2Cookie303Bug404<br/>Radial Tire<br/>505<br/>Diamond606<br/>Steam Iron<br/>707Bow Tie<br/>808Dice<br/>90\r\n<p>After this point the enemies loop around forever, and are all worth 90 points.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b11bdb6e8c59d0670570087a8f248cad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arla Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
