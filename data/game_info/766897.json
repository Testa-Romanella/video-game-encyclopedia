Do that thing! Fight monsters along the way.  Careful, you only have 60 seconds before the hourglass kills you! When  you die, your previous playthrough becomes a clone that can help or  hinder you.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Arrows or WASD: Move around\r\n</li><li>Space: Attack\r\n</li><li>Shift: Defend\r\n</li><li>Delete (backspace): Rewind time and make a clone\r\n</li><li>Hold R: Restart the game\r\n</li><li>Hold Esc: Quit the game\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>As you collect goals, you will get powerups, although I didn\u2019t have time to add feedback telling you what they are in-game.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Dragon\u2019s Blood: +1 health\r\n</li><li>Adamantite Ore: +1 damage\r\n</li><li>Bones of Prisoners: Ethereal; pass through clones and enemies\r\n</li><li>Kill 20 enemies: Speed increase\r\n</li></ul>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Your  home is under attack by monsters! It would be inevitable that they  would kill you and your siblings, except your family has the Subtle  Hourglass! You\u2019ve long been warned never to use the thing, as the moment  you touch it, you will have only 60 seconds to live! Once you die, it  will reverse time and create a time echo of your past exploits, forcing  you to relive the same 60 seconds over and over again.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the  power of the Subtle Hourglass to rescue your 2 siblings, and then gather  the ingredients needed to destroy it! All within 60 seconds\u2026\r\n</p>\r\nDevelopment notes\r\n<p>Made in Unity, art done in Aseprite, audio in Amadeus Pro.\r\n</p>\n<p>This  was a fun one to make, I\u2019ve had this sort of idea for awhile but of  course it changed a bit during development. I basically wanted to  combine aspects of Snake (kill yourself but running into yourself),  Overcooked (flooded chokepoints), and Minit (limited time before death).  The Snake part definitely fell away, but I really enjoyed the genuine  humor you get from all your little ghosts getting in your way.\r\n</p>\n<p>If I  had more time, I would make the overall feedback and level design  better, and would probably add some way to kill your ghosts off. As it  stands, if you play too long things basically become impossible.\r\n</p>\n<p>I  haven\u2019t made my own art in awhile. Holy crap that takes a long time (I  spent half the 48h on art)! I decided to use some art I already had as  reference and then basically re-painted all of it in aseprite with  modifications and added a whole lot more. I find starting with a  reference makes it much easier to produce the volume of art I needed for  this one.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:04:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f47/f47ab63b699fc54743af9bf4d42f0379.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["edelventhal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
