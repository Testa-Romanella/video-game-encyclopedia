When you die on a spike your body will stay on the spike creating a red platform. The sacrifice is one of your lives so you have to be careful where you use them, if you make too many mistakes and run out of lives it will be game over.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>Jeremy is a collective. He must sacrifice many of himself to get to The Cube. Along the way Jeremy will find lost chunks of himself which allow him to get further.</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Easy mode gives double lives and Hardcore disables checkpoints. Normal is the intended way to play. Can you get less deaths\u00a0than my lowest of 54?</p>\n<p><strong>Genres</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sidescroller/Platformer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26d/26d1475f2669859e58f18e658c3a290a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Muzzz29"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
