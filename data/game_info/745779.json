There's monsters, bandits, and much, much worse roaming these lands...<br/>Do you really think you've got what it takes to survive? Or do you think you're cut out for much more than that...<br/>You don't think you could actually rise to a place of power, take over a kingdom, and raise an army of war, do you? Besides... It's not always the big, scary beasts that you should be afraid of...  Beasts are easy to predict. They just want to kill and eat you.<br/>Humans are much harder... They pretend to be your friend first...<br/>Will you be able to provide the answers we seek? Or perhaps... You may find the answers YOU seek along the way...<br/><br/>What is  Medieval Fantasy Survival Simulator?  Well, in essence, it's just what it sounds like!<br/>It's our way of reading the feedback players have left for us on previous titles such as The Test Trilogy and others, taking their words into heavy consideration, and creating new experiences that players want and crave! Everyone at some point or another imagines themselves trying to survive through awful situations and we all innately wonder as humans whether or not we could make it out alive... Everyone thinks about surviving in an age where mankind no longer belongs... But how many people would actually cut it? How many people would actually survive, how many would die, and how many would thrive? Well, this simulator asks you a series of questions, and through your answers, will let you know what survival situation it believes you'd excel in! Would you survive being kidnapped by bandits and held for ransom? What if you were stuck in a dark dungeon, fighting beasts alone? Would your bloodline continue on?<br/>Would you Survive, or would you be just another victim of great beasts of lore, lost to ancient history and forgotten forever?<br/>There's only one way to find out...<h3>Features:</h3><br/><ul><li> Short and sweet<br/></li><li> Be a part of history with Player - Developer interaction<br/></li><li> The only game with this theme of its kind<br/></li><li> Very atmospheric and psychological<br/></li><li> Sit back, relax, and answer in-depth questions to reveal survival scenarios<br/></li><li> Super affordable for a unique experience<br/></li><li> Multiple choices with multiple endings</li></ul></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T03:08:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4f/f4fbd34a14b94f3fa67d3143ed348541.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Randumb Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Randumb Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
