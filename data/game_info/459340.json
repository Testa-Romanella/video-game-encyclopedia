The theme was Tower Defense Without Towers, however I didn't have enough time to complete. The goal was to make a single player mode where you defended points on a map and entered battles.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it's cool to have made a local multiplayer Smash Bros. clone featuring many members from the libGDX community. If I didn't include you, don't be offended. I seriously did not have the time to complete this\u00a0 despite working on it 10+ hours a day for a whole week.</p>\n<p>Not all moves have been completed for every character. Please see the bindings in the options menu. Hold a direction and press attack/special to do another move! Controller support is experiencing technical difficulties.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T02:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25b/25b246a370624cfac039c0b21e222174.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["raeleus"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
