{"id": 898394, "slug": "sakura-gym-girls", "name": "Sakura Gym Girls", "name_original": "Sakura Gym Girls", "description": "Kitagawa Shouhei is a young man who lives in a quiet town, where he runs his deceased grandfather\u2019s bookshop. His life is an ordinary one, but he\u2019s content with it, even if he hasn\u2019t had a girlfriend in years.<br/><br/>Shouhei is happy enough to while away his days among stacks of old, dusty books, while chatting with his favorite (and only) colleague, the sweet-natured and mild-mannered Asa\u2026<br/><br/>But his luck with women takes a sudden turn for the better when Asa asks him to go to the local gym with her, to help her shed some extra weight.<br/><br/>While at the gym, Shouhei runs into two very different women: the haughty and aloof Tsumiki, and the cheerful, energetic Ranko, with whom Shouhei shares a complicated past.<br/><br/>Join Shouhei as he helps Asa with her fitness regimen, all while trying to win over the icy Tsumiki and processing his feelings for Ranko.<br/><br/>Whether Shouhei will end up with Asa, Tsumiki, or Ranko (or all three of them) is up to you in this visual novel.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>Asa works at Shouhei\u2019s bookshop as his most trusted (and, indeed, only) employee. She\u2019s a quiet girl with low self-confidence, but her gentle smile ensures she always leaves her customers feeling satisfied.<br/><br/>Asa is very short, which is something she\u2019s horribly embarrassed about. She tries to counteract this by wearing heels, though she can\u2019t help but envy popular idols and models for being so tall and willowy.<br/><br/>She\u2019s liked Shouhei for a long time, but she\u2019s too shy to act on her feelings.<br/><br/><br/>Ranko used to be Shouhei\u2019s girlfriend, back when the both of them were in university. They\u2019ve since broken up, however, and Shouhei didn\u2019t imagine he would ever see her again \u2013 that is, until he sees her at his local gym.<br/><br/>Ranko is a cheerful, upbeat girl who doesn\u2019t sweat the small stuff. She\u2019s always smiling, laughing, and cracking jokes, which makes her fun to hang around with \u2013 though it can be hard to tell whether she\u2019s being serious or not.<br/><br/><br/>Tsumiki is an aloof, haughty girl who acts like an aristocrat. She takes against Shouhei after their first meeting, and she\u2019s aggressively rude towards him.<br/><br/>Tsumiki might seem unapproachable, but she does have a sweet side. She\u2019s a huge fan of romance novels, though she\u2019s never been in a relationship before herself. She dreams about being swept off her feet one day by a handsome prince, and having her own happily ever after ending\u2026<br/><br/>But that\u2019ll never happen, right?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T04:39:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4b/b4b1d3d267e4117d55ee10495d0e2266.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Winged Cloud"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Winged Cloud"], "esrb_rating": null}
