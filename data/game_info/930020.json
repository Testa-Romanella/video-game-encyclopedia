Bound off walls and make use of Dream Knight's sword to bounce off obstacles!\u00a0The game is currently in early development so what you see here is a very short demo/tutorial of the art, mechanics, and physics. My goal with Tower of Dreams is to make something with lots of depth and skill that's accessible to as many people as possible, which is why the whole game uses just one button! I'm excited to hear what people think, if you'd like to get more updates on the state of the project please consider joining our Discord:</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/yWuJzz7VBB</p>\n<p>Expect more updates very soon!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T14:45:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f1936c64b4c261f4ee975bb6685117f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SuperCitrus"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
