Try to escape this damned ethereal realm. Time is against you.\u00a0Will you succeed? If not, you can always try again :) Each time you try, you will gain experience which will unlock new parts that you can use in a new run.</p>\n<p>If you use the webgl version, you will lose your meta progression when you exit the game. However, in options you will find an \"Unlock All Parts\" which can give you immediate access to all the parts available.</p>\n<p>This game is hard. It is supposed to be hard. However, runs take at most 2 minutes and so you can try again. Levels are assembled from different sections resulting in countless possible combinations so you can always have a different experience. You can also go back to the same level either by choosing \"Repeat Level\" or by using the same code level in level selection.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n\n<p>movement - a,d - &lt;-,-&gt; - left-stick<br/>jump - space - space - button A<br/>dash - shift - shift - button B<br/>attack - m - z - button X<br/>secondary attack - n - x - button Y<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T06:55:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d44/d442186d812f8853f6d3e58d1e7263bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["erebrus", "Sangoro", "Forager", "Secbot", "Lilasterix", "Junktup"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
