Released by IntelleCo Games, it is the first game from corporate giant IntelleCo. Move, jump, and run to stop the Firees from taking over Marshmallow Land! You must have ultimate precision and a whole lot of determination to finish this game!\"</p>\n<p>While digging through some old hard drives in my basement, I found one that has a game I barely remember on it. It seems like this game was lost to time on the internet because attempting to look up \"Marshmallow Land\" on Google yields zero results from a company called \"IntelleCo Games\". When I finished the first level, the game crashed.  So I decided to upload it here for you guys to enjoy and play instead.</p>\n<p>Forgive the cover art, I'm not the best artist, and as far as I know no real cover art exists.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Read the README in the ZIP file before playing! It has some important information on the game.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T16:39:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b2/9b23d5eaae6849aa7968ff583474b672.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Mr Genie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
