But it is pretty long and difficult #hardcore. Your task is to complete the level without hitting the moving obstacles. The speed of the obstacles increase and there it is a gap where you can prepare for the next wave.\u00a0 IT IS NOT AN ENDLESS RUNNER, currently. Please support me by posting any bugs that you find, and if you want, donate me\u00a0 ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/540/54030ed3cea2ad895aeafc1674434f5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattDiamond17"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
