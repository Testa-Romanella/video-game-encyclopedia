In spite of the minimalist approach, I found the game interesting to look at.</li> <li>That was an amazing game! Interesting music. Good variety and creativity in each level, not to hard but not too easy. It's very engaging, and a good exercise for the mind, never boring in Trial And Terror! P.S. That title is absolutely ingenious. It really is a trial and error game, the \"terror\" being having to worry about those little moving stars. Great Job!</li> <li>Really enjoyable game! I actually didn't mind the music either, probably because I was concentrating so hard on the actual game. Nice and simple, very challenging at times, not too fustrating and most importantly it is actually do-able without wanting to smash the keyboard in! Good job!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-12T12:56:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e6031343a2d734827970f0e4b3ed188b.jpg", "website": "http://stargazerstudio.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Stargazer Studio", "stargazerstudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Stargazer Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
