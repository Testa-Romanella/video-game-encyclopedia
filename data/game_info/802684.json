Gather jewels and other treasures along the way and keep going because there is lava rising up and swallowing up the floors. You can\u00b4t jump in this game, but have a handy rope to throw with a press of\u00a0the A-Button, while you can punch at the other player with the B-Button.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The game has no real end, besides the deathstate and is much more fun together than alone. Maybe Ill add more stuff in the future but for now its plain simple fun to climb, And try and throw each other of the platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T10:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbb2bcf54ea3469067b8e92a8c15c25f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ancientpixel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
