This game is similar to that of a tamagotchi. The objective is simple... take care of your bird named Bird-chan. This game, although very short, tells a silent story of the sad reality's of life, and quickly changes from that of a fun cheery game where you take care of your pet, to something more solemn.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dc/5dce52fa738bc3b38386f35efc8ff9e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hatosan"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
