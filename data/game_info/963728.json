{"id": 963728, "slug": "blackout-protocol", "name": "Blackout Protocol", "name_original": "Blackout Protocol", "description": "Blackout Protocol is a tense, exciting top-down shooter that combines 3-player co-op action with roguelite progression systems. As Agents of the S2P Corporation, your mission is simple: fight your way to the heart of Section 13, a sprawling underground research base currently being overrun by its own murderous experiments.<br/><br/><br/>Looking out for your fellow Agents means more than just covering their six. In the cramped corridors of Section 13, friendly fire is a constant danger. Choose your targets carefully and coordinate positioning, using in-game voice and quickchat.<br/><br/><br/>Physical danger is just the beginning. As you cross paths with otherworldly horrors that want to claw your face off, keep an eye on your Panic Gauge, or risk a run-wrecking freakout in the middle of combat. But remember: monsters can panic, too. Wield tools like light, sound, and psionic lightning cannons to turn the tables and outwit your foes.<br/><br/><br/>Each time you enter Section 13, you'll find temporary enhancements that grant you an edge during that run. You'll also collect credits, weapons blueprints, and valuable data, which you can exchange for permanent upgrades at saferooms throughout the facility...\u00a0 if you can reach them.<br/><br/>Die on the way, and S2P's patented Death Nullification System\u2122 will see your consciousness blasted back to the start of the mission, allowing you to try and try again.<br/><br/>Because at S2P, failure is not an option.
