This is a learning experience for me and I can not wait to finish this game! The game is based on traditional old-school tabletop D&amp;D. The world is covered mostly by water with one large continent and several smaller, the game takes place on the largest continent and it's outer islands. This world is connected by a vast series of underground tunnels where humans used to live as slaves to monsters. Forbidden from using magic or weapons of any kind humans learned to develop their bodies and minds to fight back against their slavers and break free to the surface world. Upon settling on the surface humans discovered quickly that the surface world was dominated by xenophobic elves that had absolutely no tolerance for any other races and attempted to wipe out humanity. Humanity managed to survive and settled mostly on the outer islands. 200 years later humans and elves are still no closer to peace but humans have developed much in magic and technology,\u00a0 martial arts were only passed down from single masters to their students and were all but lost to the times. The game play is the focus, with each character representing an archetype and their class fulfilling a primary role. As an experienced dungeon master I want to make a game that creates a typical fantasy RPG experience with fun mechanics. As this is my first game ever, I need as much feedback as I can possibly get so I can become better at this!</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>SECTION B: CHARACTERS</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>There are 6 characters and each has a unique class.

Rand uses skills such as steal, backstab, and status inflicting attacks.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>SECTION C: SETTING AND/OR WORLD DEVELOPMENT</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The world is rather big although the players will only be on the primary continent and it's immediate surrounding islands. The political atmosphere surrounding the ongoing war with the elves creates a racial tension between the protagonists. Elves in this world are pompous to the extent that they do not believe mortal races even deserve the right to live. While Dark Elves have sworn to fight against the monster hordes that spawn within the Deep. The title \"The Deep RPG\" refers to the cavernous system of tunnels that cover the entire planet, much like forgotten realm's underdark.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b1b033bdd8a450de2f4b0a2e1de07d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Allan Bays"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
