{"id": 215509, "slug": "mole-2", "name": "Mole", "name_original": "Mole", "description": "<p>Mole is a fun game for anyone to enjoy. It is based on the classic whack-a-mole game style so it is very intuitive and easy to understand, but it will keep you playing for hours while trying to beat your own record! Or maybe your friends' records!</p>\n<p>There are three gameplay styles:</p>\n<p>The first one is the King style, where you have a limited amount of moles to hit, but you may want to be quick, because as time goes by the moles start popping more and more often!</p>\n<p>The second style would be the Lover style. The Lover mole is a mole who loves hearts and he'll do anything to get one, and every time you forget to hit a mole, a heart will pop up, so if you don't stop him, he will get it for him and you will lose one of yours! Try not to lose all three!</p>\n<p>The third style would be the Devil! You are on a deadline and every time you don't hit a mole you'll have even less time to play! So be fast and don't let any mole get away so that you can play as long you can!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a984de53bff2841828a6f5e86af162.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Badjano Entertainment"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
