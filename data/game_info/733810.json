Choose strategies by calling pit stops, deciding on types of tires, communicating with your driver, and keeping track of other racers. Can you climb to the top of the field and claim victory with your driver?</p>\n<p>Based on my own love for Formula 1 racing, I put this together as a way to develop my game engineering skills without having to get stuck in level design and advanced art. As Computer Science major, it can be tough to bring projects to completion when some problems need the expert touch of another discipline of game dev. Race Engineer Simulator is my solution: make a game where it's almost all code. If you're here off of my resume... Hello! I'd love to hear from you haha!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/054/0549cbe8fbdfdefe906bcbfda7e3255c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sergeant_Slash"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
