I call it, \"Walk the Tightrope\". In this game, the player must cross to the other side of a very deep river ravine by traversing a small and flimsy rope. The player must simply cross the ravine in order to win! When the player starts the game, the character on-screen will start leaning to the left. To counter this, the player must hold the right directional key on their keyboard until the character has become somewhat centered again. In order to slowly cross the rope, the player will press the up directional key to move forward, keeping in mind that moving forward will only cause the player to lean left even faster. If the player has leaned too far in either direction, it's game over! Before you attempt to cross the ravine yourself, keep in mind, the game starts as soon as the executable\u00a0is launched! Oh, and one thing. Changing the window size can break the game, I apologize in advance. \u00a0Have fun, tightrope walkers! Feedback is welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T05:40:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec7/ec74a79e8e01773a2068bf428312dd76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MagicalHoboCat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
