The theme for the Moray Game Jam was 'the first line of a novel'.</p>\n<p>The line I chose was 'Today he woud become a god.' This is from the novel Black Sun, by Rebecca Roanhorse.</p>\n<p>This game is a small, linear RPG, with a run time between 45 minutes to an hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>\n<p>After the conclusion of the jam, I plan to make a few quality of life improvements to this game, along with any bug fixes and tweaks to the story, maps etc. The original version of the game will remain both downloadable and HTML based. The updated version will be downloadable only</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T09:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e64/e64da2dc6ff5be30cf5593aa31ed481f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Allus Interactive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
