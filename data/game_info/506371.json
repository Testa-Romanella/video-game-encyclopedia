Click on the defender you want to place at the bottom and if you can afford it, you will be able to place it on the grid. Depending on the difficulty you select, you will have 1, 2 or 3 lives. If you lose all your lives you will just have to try that failed level again.</p>\n<p>Press P to pause at any time.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy and please leave any feedback in the comments. I know there are little things that need to be fixed but I'm now putting all my focus into my own original projects now. Any feedback on this may not get resolved but will definitely prove useful going forward.</p>\n<p>Cheers!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T05:44:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1c3845e80807e822cbabaab037acf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Steelio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
