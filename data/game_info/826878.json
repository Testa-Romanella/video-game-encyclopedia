They thought wrong. Now, she\u2019s on a rampage to settle an old score...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEntertainment Of The Near Future<br/>\nHOMICIDAL All-Stars is the late 21st century\u2019s most popular - and most brutal - reality game show. In a fraying society increasingly plagued by extreme income inequality, rapacious corporations, climate change-triggered natural disasters and wars, violent crime, and overpopulation, the bloody carnage of HOMICIDAL All-Stars provides a welcome distraction.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSurvival Is Not Guaranteed <br/>\nEach season of the show starts at the beginning of the month and runs every<br/>\nnight until either all contestants are dead or one or more of them has won it all. But now that Scarlett Martillo has joined the competition, this season is about to be bloodier than ever.\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody Ever Said The Rules Would Be Fair<br/>\nThe shady Omega Corporation owns a majority stake in the show and is its<br/>\nprimary sponsor; they only care about getting higher ratings\u2026 no matter the cost. If changing the rules mid-game means more sensational action - and more viewers - the show\u2019s director is more than willing to throw any semblance of \u201cfairness\u201d aside.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFeatures\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>[Turn-Based Battles] Battles are turn-based and hand-crafted - with changing goals, various level mechanics, and environmental elements you can use to your advantage during combat.</li>\n<li>[Real-time exploration] Overcome an obstacle course of deadly traps and lethal puzzles in real-time, but be prepared for an ambush at any corner.</li>\n<li>[Team Members] Each team member has unique abilities and playstyle.
