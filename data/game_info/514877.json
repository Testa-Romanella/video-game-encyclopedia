{"id": 514877, "slug": "chex-quest-3", "name": "Chex Quest 3", "name_original": "Chex Quest 3", "description": "<p>In 2008, Chex Quest 3 was developed and released as a service to fans by former Digital Caf\u00e9 members Charles Jacobi (art director and lead artist) and Scott Holman (programmer). Former Digital Caf\u00e9 sound design leader Andrew Benson, also contributed several songs for the game. Originally intended as a single standalone level, Jacobi announced the development of a full sequel at the Chex Quest Fan Forums (Chexquest.org) in June 2008, and the full game was released in September of the same year. Chex Quest 3 employs the ZDoom source port, and is considerably larger in size than the previous two games. Jacobi&#39;s release of Chex Quest 3 also included ZDoom-based versions of Chex Quest and Chex Quest 2, with significant enhancements and noted problems redressed. Chex Quest 2 in particular had been remastered, with some levels significantly revised or completely overhauled. Charles Jacobi credited the praise and compliments of fans, especially through fan-made projects such as one titled &quot;The Ultimate Chex Quest&quot;, as inspiration to complete this project.</p>\n<p>The plot for this sequel is set ten years later than the events of the first two Chex Quest games, with the invasion of the planet Ralston by the Flemoids. The breadth of the story was expanded to a much larger scale, possessing a seemingly more grim scenario than the predecessors\u2014the latter of which Charles Jacobi dispelled as unintentional, in that he simply &quot;wanted it to feel bigger&quot; than the first two games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T10:48:19", "background_image": null, "website": "http://www.chucktropolis.com/gamers.htm", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
