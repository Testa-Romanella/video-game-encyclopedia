The world is a cruel place. The stock market is most. Since the invention of money humanity has been raising a new economic bubble, one after another.<br/>You know it, we know it. It all starts the same, end the same. But would you dare for the risk and rule the market by inflating and deflating this brittle and whimsy bubble? How long can you keep this new Economic Bubble from final fatal burst?</p>\n\n<p>Alright, gentlemen! This is simple (but risky, remember?) game with not so much controls: you only need 3 keyboard buttons and some luck. <br/><strong>(!) (Note: Click on any place on game canvas if keyboard button do not work for some reason) (!)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>[A] - use pump to inflate the bubble<br/>[D] - use a needle to make a hole to deflate the bubble<br/>[S] - apply medical patch to fix the hole just done. This will stop deflating but not for 100%.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0Game\u00a0made\u00a0in\u00a0~72\u00a0hours\u00a0for\u00a0Ludum\u00a0Dare\u00a046.
