The boss also now drops the fire weapon.</p>\n<p>There's a locked door in the starting hub. Once through the door there is a wall only destroyed by fire, past that is the final level with Oryx, so make sure to not\u00a0replace the fire weapon.</p>\n<p>Rogue is probably the best class tbh</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>LMB - Shoot</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Use class ability. (if mana is at max)</p>\n<p>E - Open bags</p>\n<p>F - Drink health potion</p>\n<p>C - Switch weapon slot. Use this to switch to an empty slot\u00a0when opening boss drops incase its a weapon, this way it won't overwrite your current weapon.
