Researched on the advantages and limitations of skill training in Virtual Reality.</p>\n<p>[Idea]</p>\n<p>We propose development of robust Virtual Reality training programs, offering a way for skilled professionals to train the on-site technicians and to perform remote diagnostics over Virtual Reality, potentially in real time. To achieve this, we make use of digital twins - a virtual model of a realmachine, so, the professionals can use the immersive effect to, for instance, explode the twin model and either explain it\u2019s working or help pinpoint the cause of a malfunction, allowing the professional to interact with and explain the working of the machine, thus making it a form of Assisted Reality powered by Digital Twins. This will not only provide training opportunities but also provide Ad-hoc maintenance opportunities, using the real time data provided by Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) devices.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:35:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/992266799b57f8fb0f5707f9c1802cc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adhiraj.B"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
