This is done by rotating or changing the shape and moving according to how the gate is set up. The longer you fit in the faster the game gets. Do you dare to be square?</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Easy to pick up but hard to master!</li><li>New mechanics compared to other endless runners, such as rotating and transforming your shape!</li><li>A very simple aesthetic of neon lines that\u00a0help serve the player to associate the shapes with the gates by color!</li><li>Clean UI!</li></ul>\n\r\nControls\r\nMovementRotateTransformLeft/Right ArrowsUp/Down ArrowsWASD - each letter is different shape<br/>\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>This is a\u00a0solo project for me where everything was designed and made by me.
