Maybe someday I'll make a \"DX\" version wherein I can fulfil my ambitions for this one...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T06:15:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a588daefc3d74fbe14180c4a87760648.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michirin9801"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
