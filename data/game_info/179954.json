There was wind in evening, the dog in front of door and others daily things, which makes the user feel comfortable and peaceful. I used warm colors and sound to achieve the atmosphere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My inspiration comes from a Japanese movie named My Neighbor Totoro, which created by Hayao Miyazaki. It was a vivid portrayal the charm and slow pace of village life in Japan. In order to reproduce the house they lived, the Aichi World EXPO displayed the house of Satsuki Kusakabe and Mei Kusakabe (\u30b5\u30c4\u30ad\u3068\u30e1\u30a4\u306e\u5bb6). According to this movie, I want to create a warm house to make the user feel comfortable. Therefore, the sketch of my first assignment was full of style to the Japanese anime style.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The color of this environment was warm-toned, which makes the house more warm. I changed the background from day yo night. Therefore, the color fundamental key is dark but with warm yellow of the wall lamp. The material of the house is wood but not bricks because wood cabin is more simple and rustic, which is create a warm atmosphere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sound I used is more focus on a comfortable feelings, such as the sound of breeze and the sound of fireplace. I paid great attention to the sound of this environment. Sound is able to arouse emotions of the audience to most. Little forest, a movie was released in 2015, which stimulated me a lot. The heroine and the hero eat breakfast by the fireplace with the sound of fire. It looks warm in this movie. In order to create a more family environment, I added the sound of fireplace.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p>1.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro</p>\n<p>2.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Forest_(film)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/867/86747f67bb38360ff8c5904350273a80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Jingxuan Meng"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
