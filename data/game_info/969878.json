When you press play, the lines rotate to create beautiful designs.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are no puzzles, no objectives. It's simply an environment in which you can create beautiful spirographs, set to the most zen-inducing music and visuals.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nZen Trails is very effective at relaxing and inspiring, as well as reducing anxiety. It gives the mind something to focus on which is low pressure yet still stimulating with a small amount of gentle math and a very satisfying payoff when seeing your designs come to life. And for those players who lived through the 90's, perhaps a little nostalgia if they ever played with a spirograph maker. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI'm a solo dev and I really hope you enjoy this little project of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n- Intuitive click and drag design process<br/>\r\n- Community Hub where you can upload and download designs made by other players<br/>\r\n- Robust tutorial, including tips for making designs beautiful<br/>\r\n- Copy-paste<br/>\r\n- Unlimited undo steps<br/>\r\n- All possible colors<br/>\r\n- Unlimited line thickness<br/>\r\n- Save and load designs<br/>\r\n- autosave<br/>\r\n- Light weight, can run on low end machines.<br/>\r\n- Very relaxing music", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T20:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a49b96e5a5f9e6bcd4ece46b2d9e94b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Universe Juice"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Universe Juice"], "esrb_rating": null}
