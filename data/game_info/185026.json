It has large enemy variety and solid combat mechanics. It was developed in Unity by an inexperienced team of two students as a passion project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is the culmination of a summer's worth of work by two second-year engineering university students. Both of us are passionate gamers that wanted to make our own game as an exploration of our own abilities and to celebrate our love for video games. We came into this project knowing nothing about Unity, pixel art, C# and game design, so we had to learn almost everything on the spot as we made the game. After we finish development on this, we hope to take what we learned to future projects and game jams.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/796/79604ccd0a088a40ca7a9bf412a0fb38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ekaperiodictable11"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
