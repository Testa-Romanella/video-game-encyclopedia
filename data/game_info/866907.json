They turn passive during the day, giving you a break to rebuild your defenses. This game is\u00a0<strong>endless</strong>, the end is up to you.</p>\n<p>WASD to move; Q to open the pause menu; E to open inventory; Left click to pick up items; Right click to activate objects (i.e., doors, chests).</p>\n<p>This is a game I made to expand my game making skills. Tried my hand at things like inventories, saving/loading, AI, and releasing a game. I will most likely no longer update the game beyond release.<br/></p>\n<p>Main Menu art and cover art not done by me. It's done by a cool dude named Bond made, with permission,\u00a0for the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T10:48:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/392/39210ee62592ad31177def9307680c08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Just Mr. Sir"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
