I probably won't fix some of the bugs such as the camera sometimes clipping into the ground, etc. (just ignore that for best gameplay!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T09:53:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/085/08544009a10e42717539735c6392d02a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drigozx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
