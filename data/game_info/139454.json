When we see it, \u00a0hear it, think it, or even saying the word yawn, our natural response\u00a0is to yawn. The question is, can Coco the Yawning Dog make you yawn and send you\u00a0to bed?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Up to 5 players can play. One player, Coco is against the team of Jons and Erica. \u00a0When the time is up and Coco didn't yawn enough to get everyone in bed, then the Jons and Erica win. If Coco can get the players to bed before the time is up then she wins and has a party of one since she put her friends\u00a0to bed. Who will be the sleepy loser in the end?\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1a/e1a03fc81c36f345193c3bf5daccfbce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jusjustin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
