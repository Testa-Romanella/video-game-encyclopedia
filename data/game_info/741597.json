No one was able to resist their power, that is, until a hero named Carolus emerged. He was able to defeat the Kaibutsu leader, who happened to be his sister, and save the nation. After this, the people made him their king. However, 65 years have passed since his victory, and gradually, as he has aged, he has surrendered more of his political power to his vassal dukes, who have very different ideas on how the kingdom should be run.</p>\n<p>All of this is trivial background noise for a certain bartender from a backwoods forest town. Vance, the bartender in question, is bored with life, and decides he needs some excitement and some big money. The less actual hard work involved, the better. And nothing will stand in his way ...</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>Three the Hard Way&#39;s gameplay is pretty typical as far as Rm2k games go, but there are a few wrinkles here and there ( such as leveling up ) that may throw you for a loop; pretty much everything you need to know is explained in game when you need to know it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-20T23:16:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/727/727c707d71dcd6920bb58b2d9ac705e1.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/39/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
