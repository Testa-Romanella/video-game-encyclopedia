Draft a team of five beetles and move them around the board to try and control as many spots adjacent to the trees that produce points.</p><p>Some beetles can 'fly' over other beetles and obstacles. Some can 'push' other beetles out of the way and take their spot. Others can 'stun' opposing beetles; a stunned beetle cannot more or score. To unstun a beetle, select and tickle it. Tickling returns the beetle to its normal state and also protects the beetle from stunning for a turn. Some beetle even have added affects that trigger when tickled!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d56eaafbbc0f641940743f5ca0531c76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["heartyramen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
