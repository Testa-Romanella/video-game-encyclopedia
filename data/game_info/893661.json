A story about magic is the only thing the old man can think of. You find yourself watching and playing the story of the past which formed Lemuria into what it is today.</p>\n\n<p>Notes:\r\n </p>\n<p>This is the first time I\u2019ve ever used RPG Maker MZ and to be honest I prefer Unity, but this intrigued me. It\u2019s not very long at the moment, cutscenes/play/cutscenes that go directly back to the main menu. So in other words a demo. Most graphics and sounds come automatically with RPG Maker. There is a lot that is basic and hasn\u2019t been changed besides a few extra bits here and there, I\u2019m still a newb at using RPG Maker.   </p>\n<p>I plan on continuing the game eventually since I do have the full story written out. I just have to convert it some how to game form. But having a job and life, I can\u2019t devote all my time to this. If this is something you like and want to see more of please leave a comment or donate a few $ to help. If it gets enough interest I can invest more time as well as getting better graphics/sounds for it.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T08:50:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db8781c086492876ffdbf5e7f8740222.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["megowhat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
