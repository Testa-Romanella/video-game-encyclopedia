It experiments with the idea of RNG in platforming. It is very frustrating and I\u00a0hate it but It did get me thinking about risk vs reward in games. I hope this experimental design helps you think about it too.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, or want the code or assets,\u00a0please comment on the itch.io page or email me at riordancallil@outlook.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T03:30:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d56c8df7f2df421baaa5a4039f9e769e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["upakai"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
