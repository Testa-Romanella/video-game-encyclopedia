JAB! is the physics-based party game where you collect silly bobbleheads and fight with guns, confetti and lightning bolts and stuff.<br/><br/><ul><li>2 to 4 friends/enemies/strangers you met on the street in either Local or Online Multiplayer (COMING SOON\u2122) (NO SINGLE PLAYER MODE)<br/></li><li>Physics-Based and very unpredictable combat<br/></li><li>15 surprisingly cool levels, more coming with free updates<br/></li><li>20 different over the top crazy weapons to maul JABBOs with<br/></li><li>Over 40 different collectible JABBOs with different voices</li></ul><br/><h3>NO BORING GUNS</h3>We\u2019re all done using AKs, RPGs and pistols. In JAB!, you destroy/murder/frag your friends/enemies/random strangers with internet famous armaments like the confetti cannon, fireworks launcher, dynamite, drone strikes and a sword that dashes towards the nearest enemy, like the one in the super famous game on the console made by an American company. Same level of destruction, but now with 100% more fun!<h3>ONLINE &amp; COUCH MULTIPLAYER</h3>Sometimes you just want to blast your friends into orbit. Luckily, JAB can be played locally with 2-4 players. Stuck in quarantine? You can also play with them remotely, or decimate strangers in the online lobbies. (ONLINE MULTIPLAYER COMMING SOON\u2122)<h3>BUILD YOUR COLLECTION</h3>Everyone gets a bunch of jabbos and weapons to start out and the more you play, the more stuff you unlock. Super simple!! Online, let the chaos commence. You can play with only cat launchers, or only melee weapons (disclaimer: if I ever put any into the game). The host will decide what's available, so jump into someone else's lobby to discover new stuff, or create a lobby to show off your awesome rare jabbos. What a sense of accomplishment.<h3>PARTICIPATION AWARDS FOR EVERYONE</h3>Get dat points sis! Since everyone needs to be happy, you get awards for winning, destroying, falling out, using lots of weapons and almost everything else. The winner each game turns into LITERAL GOLD so it\u2019s easy to gank them next game. Players that lose gets these two words: git. gud.<h3>NO MICROTRANSACTIONS, NO BULLSH*T</h3>When you buy the game, everything is included and unlockable for free.
