{"id": 938593, "slug": "into-the-babyverse", "name": "Into The Babyverse", "name_original": "Into The Babyverse", "description": "<p>Into the Babyverse is a 3D space shooter game taking place inside a baby\u2019s ingenious yet innocent imagination. You play as a baby space explorer who is on a mission to rescue his toys abducted by the aliens. This journey consists of various adventures that seem so utterly normal when viewed from outside but if you dive deep into a baby\u2019s mind, the world as we know is much more imaginative and silly. You\u2019ll encounter sleep-inducing milk bottle spaceships, marble planets, cookie asteroids, and a lot more happening inside a baby\u2019s crib! You have to wade through the milky way while using your various candy-inspired guns, diaper traps, and poop bombs to evade and destroy spaceships. But most importantly, have fun doing it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is made in Unreal using both Blueprints and C++.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T11:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fff/fff1c1f4f7d0e29a09053de724978049.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["team-archit"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
