You've been so bad that Satan himself has given you the option to have a sweet victory ride to rapture. So pick a song and enjoy the view. Fly around maybe. Or don't touch anything. Just. Enjoy. <br/></p><p>This is a rhythmic space rider. Quite possibly more of a music player than a game. The fire and demon hands move according to the beat of the music.<br/><br/>This was made in Construct 2. I would actually like to add the option for users to upload their own music to play during the ride but I couldn't get that working. If anyone knows how I can have a users music uploaded and analysed in Construct, please let me know. I don't plan on keeping any music in this. Why that would be illegal, wouldn't it?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4df6f9079d0af354f9f9960ed6f4d716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LadySith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
