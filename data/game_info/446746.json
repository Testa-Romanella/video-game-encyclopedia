However, I think this is a good grass growing simulator at least. My main take away from this experience is that parenting objects\u00a0to a moving piece of land and having functions work around it\u00a0can be kinda\u00a0tricky.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T07:43:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/898/8989b2a14a91d5c815fa19a1540e343b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["welby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
