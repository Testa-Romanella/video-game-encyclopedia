All the challenge comes when you add more and more targets... including false ones to lure you. You have to remember which are the true and the false targets, track them as they move and not lose them.</p>\n<p> The game was designed with the help of martial artists and physiotherapists as an exercise to train peripheral vision. You can also play before going to bed, as Very Eye Level is very relaxing. This might be related to the variation of motor function in eye muscles. And to the peaceful atmosphere, of course.</p>\n<p> <br/> <strong>Instructions :</strong></p>\n<p> Add true or false targets. Move the camera to keep the true ones always on screen.</p>\n<p> Game score increases with time. It increases faster with more targets.</p>\n<p> F1 (or H) to see help screen.</p>\n<p> F2 to enter cheat mode : targets movements will be restricted near the middle of the game area, so you need no more to move the camera. Game score becomes frozen. Game over won't happen anymore. You can restart a non cheat game thanks to the menu (Escape).</p>\n<p> Profiles, scores, and difficulty are automatically saved.</p>\n<p> You can change key mapping in the launch window (that usual Unity window), in the \"input\" tab.</p>\n<p> You can also use mouse buttons and wheel to move (and use the menu).</p>\n<p><strong>Versions :</strong></p><ul><li>Stable<ul><li>Windows</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Experimental<ul><li>Linux</li><li>Mac OSX</li><li>Oculus Rift</li><li>HTC Vive</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ac/7ac5021e7fd4d8613dc2cb94ee623576.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acreplume"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
