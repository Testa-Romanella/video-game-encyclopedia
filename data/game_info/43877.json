{"id": 43877, "slug": "quake-champions", "name": "Quake Champions", "name_original": "Quake Champions", "description": "<p>Quake Champions is a multiplayer competitive FPS developed by Id Software.</p>\n<p>The gameplay resembles the same arena shooter mechanics as the previous installments. For the first time in the series, the so-called champions appear in the game. Each champion has a different amount of health, top speed and a unique ability that can be used once in 20-45 seconds depending on the champion and needs to be recharged after usage. The abilities are designed using the rock-paper-scissors principle with each ability serving as a counter to another. This was done in order to put emphasis on a player&#39;s skill and not the chosen character. The game also features character customization system which allows changing the look of any selected champion.</p>\n<p>There is no loadout system in the game whatsoever. Players have to pick up the weapons scattered on the map.</p>\n<p>Players can download the game for free, yet they will have access to only one Champion, Ranger. The players have to either rent new champions using the in-game currency or by the so-called champions pack that will unlock every in-game character for an unlimited amount of time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:03:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fba/fbae1bcfae1feffda6a11fbc1c939420.jpg", "website": "https://quake.bethesda.net/", "rating": 3.27, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 385, "owned": 5577, "beaten": 95, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 616, "playing": 49}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 104, "ratings_count": 1000, "suggestions_count": 323, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 1004, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["id Software", "Saber Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
