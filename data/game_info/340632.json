Then this game is perfect for you! It has<strong> slow-motion explosions</strong> stuff flying everywhere and .... well thats it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first weekend Project (will be a series of smaller games, developed in 2 days, released every now and then). The game contains about 30 minutes play time (5 levels), so it\u00b4s free. If you want to motivate me for bigger projects or more small ones, you can donate. I\u00b4ll be happy about every penny.</p>\n<p>Works fine with: Intel I7/7Gen,\u00a0 NVidia GTX 1060, 12GB RAM</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:55:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e5756b6da7f7b9753fdb44846c24ffa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["robiiii Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
