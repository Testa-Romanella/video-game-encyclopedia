It is a cute 2D drink-making game set in Bermodo City, inhabited by soft animals who happen to love soft drinks. Take orders, make the right drinks for the right customers, and win their favor in the next few days.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Your Aunt Dora has headed into retirement, and has left her beloved \u201cAunt Dora\u2019s Pop Shop\u201d in your name to carry on the torch. After the first few days, you start to notice the same customers coming in and ordering the same drinks. You must commit these drinks to memory, but it doesn\u2019t hurt that your aunt has left you a handy recipe book (thanks, Aunt Dora!) in case you forget some details. Serve your regulars and get to know them while doing so.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to interact.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Narrative &amp; Story: Kira Pelletier and Kadia Gregory\r\n</p>\n<p>Design, Coding and Programming: R\u00e9jean Lagass\u00e9 and Justin Reece\r\n</p>\n<p>Audio &amp; Music: Andrew Goehring\r\n</p>\n<p>Art: Sin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T15:53:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/602ba47eb34891ae46b01e3bd1dca9b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garguth"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
