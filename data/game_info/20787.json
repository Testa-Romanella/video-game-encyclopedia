In drafts you first pick the cards you'll use , then enter a mini-tournament in which you have access to only those cards.No MicrotransactionsEarn cards through play, not by pay.Cross-platform PlayThe Steam version of Lucadian Chronicles allows for matchmaking in both leagues and drafts with the existing Wii U player base.Note: Lucadian Chronicles Requires an Internet Connection in All ModesLucadian Chronicles requires a persistent internet connection to play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-03T23:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d83/d8367c34e0f5a706707629ed6815c306.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 18, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Wii U", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dark Roast Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dark Roast Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
