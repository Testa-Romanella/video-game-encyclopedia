A Sega Game Gear version was planned, but scrapped, though a prototype version with the full completed game was leaked online.</p>\n<p>The game is based on the Spirou et Fantasio comic book series. It features the adventure of Spirou trying to save his kidnapped friend Count Champignac and stop his arch-enemy Cyanida from making robots rule the earth. The game was noted for its good graphics and for being faithful to Spirou et Fantasio the comic book series, but due to the relatively high difficulty, most reviewers only recommended the game for true fans of the comic book series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4a69e579ead2a841d78815f0e8ab660.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SNES", "Game Boy", "PC", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Infogrames Entertainment", "Bit Managers"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Infogrames Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
