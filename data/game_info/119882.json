This weekend was supposed to be a relaxing getaway for yourself and your pregnant wife. Camping has always been something you have enjoyed, though this time is different. Everyone seems to have had the same idea, including many extroverts you would rather not affiliate with. Toddney hates people, and would prefer to NOT converse with them. All was going well until Toddney's wife asked him to get a very peculiar type of food from a nearby store. Her pregnancy cravings were begging for mint ice cream and olives.</p><p>GOAL:</p><p> Keep moving North! Get to the store without losing all your Energy, and with your Reputation intact. Each time you speak to someone, there is a cost. Reduce their Patience to zero to \"win\" the confrontation. Make sure to pick up items. These increase your various stats for a short duration. Increased stats means you have more options in dialoue.</p><p>CONTROLS:</p><p> WASD/Arrow Keys = Move</p><p> Space = Wait</p><p> Escape = Pause Menu</p><p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f92678988ec380f0b0698ea5e6c83fc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cynapse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
