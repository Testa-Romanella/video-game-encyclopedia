{"id": 914808, "slug": "open-fishing-xl", "name": "Open Fishing XL", "name_original": "Open Fishing XL", "description": "Open Fishing XL is an open world fishing game focused on creating a relaxing experience. Fill out a book with all of the 100 fish species, explore the large map, manage your cash to buy bait, enjoy the chill nature of fishing, and far more features planned in early access updates.<br/><br/><br/>I\u2019ve tried to make an intuitive fishing system that anyone can understand. Simply pick some bait, throw out your line and make sure the fish doesn\u2019t get away!<br/><br/><br/>The open world I\u2019ve created for Open Fishing XL feels alive with birds, bugs and of course fish. With several regions and dozens of smaller areas within those all containing different fish it will take some exploration to catch them all.<br/><br/><br/>Every fish has their own tastes so you\u2019ll have to experiment to see what each fish likes. Bait can be bought from a vendor who can be found throughout the island. So look around for any places he might be hiding in.<br/><br/><br/>The book will teach you how to fish and let you record your progress. it shows what fish you\u2019ve caught, helps you remember what fish like which bait and where you caught them in the past.<br/><br/><br/>All that I\u2019ve mentioned so far is what is in the game now. I am, however, planning much more. In my devlogs I discuss what new features I have in mind and give you a glimpse into the development. I also am excited to work with the players to add new features and improve current ones.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T02:52:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0d/a0dcade6c96bc1bf5901781686ba748e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kunstaat"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kunstaat"], "esrb_rating": null}
