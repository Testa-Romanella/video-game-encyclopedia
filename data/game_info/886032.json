It was not some sacred rite of initiation \u2014 it was often frustrating, with petty, vindictive, and railroading dungeon masters and players more interested in living out their own individual fantasies than playing a game with other people. It was still pretty fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T14:00:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/007f88d9e245f0f7ae8eef10a21039af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["merritt k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
