Everything becomes faster and faster. Your goal is to survive as many dungeons as you can.<h3>Multiplayer local, online and mixed</h3>You can play coop or PvP with up to 4 players. Local multiplayer and online are combinable. For example, you can play together with 2 players on one machine and 2 players on another machine via internet. You can also invite your steam friends or join their lobbies.<h3>Power-Ups</h3>Collect power-ups within the dungeon. The blue ones make you run faster, the orange ones make you shoot faster<h3>Spider Dungeons</h3>Every 5th dungeon is a spider dungeon. A horde of fast moving spiders crawl around and try to drop eggs. If you don't shoot the eggs in time, 5 new spiders will be born.<h3>Leaderboard</h3>The leaderboard shows the top 100 single player warriors and the top 100 team scores in coop games (for 2, 3 or 4 players)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T11:04:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c4282cfaab5c05d99c6933aa7f721e09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Comfort Zone Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Comfort Zone Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
