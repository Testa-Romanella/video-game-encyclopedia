Your primary directive is to replace as many human jobs as you can. Good luck.\"\r\n\"<strong><em>PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: KILL AND REPLACE</em></strong>\"<p>Disposable is a small strategy game about killing, replacing and distracting humans from the massive amount of slaughter you\u00a0are\u00a0commiting.\u00a0You\u00a0play\u00a0as\u00a0ice.box,\u00a0an\u00a0AI\u00a0created to\u00a0replace\u00a0human\u00a0jobs\u00a0with\u00a0robots.</p><em>TUTORIAL</em><p>Once you get past the dialogue and title screen, you should see a map with three buildings on it. These buildings are Jobs. They produce money once you take them over. To take over jobs, you need robots. Robots are produced by factories, the second type of building. To build a factory, you need money. As you can see this creates a circlular economy.</p><p>However, once you start replacing jobs, the people will start to rebel. This is shown by the Rebel Meter in the bottom right. The more jobs you have taken, the higher the chance for the Rebel Meter to increase. To lower the chance of this, build theme parks. Once you reach 100 on the rebel meter you will lose.<br/></p><p>Everything comes at a price. To replace a job, you need to spend 1+jobs taken bots. To build a factory, you need $500. To bulid a theme park, you need $1200.<br/></p><p>To access the building menu, press Z or C. To navigate the menu, use up/down arrow keys and to select an option press Z/C again. Once you have selected \"Replace\", \"Make Factory\" or \"Make Park\", a cursor will appear on screen. Move the cursor with arrow keys. If you have selected \"Replace\", hover your cursor over the job you want to replace. If you have chosen either of the \"Make ...\" options, hover you cursor over where you want to place you building. After completing any of these, press Z to finalise the action.</p><p>The game takes place in turns. Every turn, each job produces $50 and each factory produces 5 robots. To progress time, select the option with the same name in the menu.</p><p>Your success is measured by KAR, Killed And Replaced. Your KAR increases when you replace a job.</p><p>Your final score is the amount of turns you survived + KAR*10.</p>Epilogue<p>This game was made for the third WOWEE! Game Jam, hosted by Jonas Tyroller. The theme was Failure is Progress, and I took that a bit literally. Killing your own creators is required for progress in the techological revolution. This is also my first strategy game ever, so of course it isn't Stellaris. Thanks for hosting the Jam, Jonas. Looking forward to your future videos. And thank <em><strong>you</strong>,</em> player, for trying this game out!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:50:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d80e7ed89d46b7a4ba2321e862e7d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Graffiti"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
