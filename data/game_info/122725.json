This review is a manual process and most messages will be reviewed within 2-3 days maximum.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Why wasn't my message included?</em></strong><ul><li>The intent of the project was for it to include messages that are positive and inclusive. If your message directed hate or intolerance towards any group of people it will not be included. If your message was a joke (eg. rick roll etc) then it will not be included.</li></ul><ul><li>Messages that are direct quotes from famous people will also not typically be included. The goal is for authentic messages from individual people.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>How do I report an inappropriate message?</em></strong><ul><li>Contact me via the support page for the game here on itch.io and it will be addressed as soon as possible.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c9/6c96a561c210c26be778e5b57c161323.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
