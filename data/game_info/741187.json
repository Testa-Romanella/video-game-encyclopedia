They rotate, they spin, they shoot out at you, and sometimes, they just sit there.<br/><br/>Along the way, you\u2019ll master wall-jumping, double-jumping, bouncing, springs, vanishing platforms, moving platforms and even portals as you leap from level to geometric level, moving along, up and down the screen to put in your best possible performance over 60 challenging and varied stages.<br/><br/>Then you can leap into the dedicated Speedrun Mode to really test your abilities and (possibly) become a Twitch sensation with your mad speedrunning skills.<br/><br/><strong>reIterate()</strong> is ultimately designed to represent a game from a theoretical retro console that never actually existed. Something old and familiar, yet also a little bit different and strange. And always, always fun to play.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>More than 60</strong>\u00a0hand-crafted levels, designed with a meticulous philosophy<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Optional collectibles</strong>\u00a0for that extra challenge<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Unlockable backstory segments</strong>\u00a0and fully skippable cutscenes to add lore and depth to the experience<br/>\n</li><li>Dedicated\u00a0<strong>Speedrun</strong>\u00a0Mode<br/>\n</li><li>A much harder\u00a0<strong>Black Edition</strong>\u00a0mode, where every level has been remixed and redesigned to push you to your limits.<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Dedicated 'Time Slow' for accessibility.\u00a0</strong>Stuck on a particular bit?
