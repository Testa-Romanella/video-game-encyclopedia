For Ludum Dare 49, I had made something much more simple so I wanted to see if I can 'reach higher' for this one.. man, was I\u00a0wrong. I was already going out of my comfort zone by going for a visual novel style game, but also drawing inspiration from Heavy Rain and Detroit Become Human, I also wanted to incorporate quick-action game play where you had to press the key that appears on the screen in time. Making the base game/story ended up eating a lot more of my time than I had anticipated.</p>\n<p>Things I wanted to add include:</p>\n<ul><li>Many more quick actions (would appeal a lot more to the theme of \"Delay the Inevitable\". If you know, you know haha)</li><li>More animations</li><li>Interactive dialogue (options would lead to different outcomes-ish)</li><li>Interactive background items</li><li>Actual proper\u00a0cutscenes\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>But all of which were pretty much cut to make at least a finished product for the compo haha. The game itself was a much more artistic take on the theme rather than mechanics based, which is something outside of my comfort zone, but even though I overscoped very hard and I feel that I could have done things much better in hindsight, this was a great learning experience for me and overall was very fun, which I think is what matters the most.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T22:58:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13d7e4891195e5423a711a657fecd937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PKZinpo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
