There are 2 types of cards: Elements and Aspects. Aspects have ATK and DEF skills as well as a preferred Element (shown as the background of the card), which adds +1 to the skill being used (if you're attacking you get +1 to ATK, if you're defending you get +1 to DEF). The goal if to outmatch the opponent's card's DEF with your card's ATK. And when able attack the opponent directly to reduce his hitpoints to 0.\u00a0You play cards by clicking them and placing them onto the board. To attack you simply click a placed Aspect.</p>\n<p>When you win an engagement you will also be rewarded new cards that will help you later. You can manage your Deck from the Overworld via the Deck Manager. Simply select the 2 cards you want to swap then click the swap button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T23:38:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a6/5a63dc45b25f98f8f382beac60c3d4c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JackOatley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
