Why can't you remember?  What does everything mean?  Using a new experimental virtual reality therapy, maybe you'll know the truth.  Stepping into the shoes of a silent amnesiac, you must traverse through the virtual worlds of your own dreams, finding clues that may lead you to the answers of your mysterious past.  But, not all is as it seems.  There will be many dangers along the way, both in reality and in your own mind.  Are you prepared for what you might find in the Dreamscape?<br/><br/>Welcome To The Dreamscape is a story driven, first person, puzzle game about trying to learn about your past through your own dreams, but, not all is as it seems.  Journey through the amazingly odd world of your own mind and piece together your story.  Game-play involves mostly puzzle solving and narrative, but there are hints of combat and stealth as well.<br/><br/>This was a game created by 14 year old Conner Rush who lives in a small town in West Virginia over the course of 2 years.  It's entirely a passion project created through self-taught coding and dedication.  We really do hope that you enjoy your experience with Welcome To The Dreamscape!
