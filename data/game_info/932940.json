{"id": 932940, "slug": "convergence-fizzytheballoon", "name": "Convergence (fizzytheballoon)", "name_original": "Convergence (fizzytheballoon)", "description": "<p><em>Convergence</em> is a game about two pieces of the heart, journeying to converge with each other.\u00a0They have unique abilities that players can use to navigate through the forest. One of the pieces of the heart is more suited for horizontal movement, with its forceful dash ability which can break through special red tiles, while the other piece is better for vertical movement, with its double jump and downward smash\u00a0abilities. Players may switch between the two characters, avoid obstacles and guide them on their journey to reunite.</p>\n<p>As players make their way through the forest, they will encounter various challenges that will test their skills and strategy. For example, players may need to use the forceful dash ability to break through walls or avoid spikes, or use the double jump to cross pits, or smash through breakable floors.\u00a0Once, the two characters meet, their powers merge and can both be used.\u00a0However, once the two parts meet, something is still not quite right. Thus, the final leg of the journey requires the two halves of the heart to pool their skills together to find the true convergence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Software Used:\u00a0<br/>- Unity</p>\n<p>- Blender</p>\n<p>- Pixilart</p>\n<p>- Soundtrap</p>\n<p>- Porceate</p>\n<p>- Dash sound from Mixkit</p>\n<p>-Chat GPT (used for this description)</p>\n<p>All assets created by UPGRADE team from the Unviversity of Pennsylvania</p>\n<p>Team Members:<br/></p>\n<p>Lewis Ghrist</p>\n<p>Charles Wang</p>\n<p>Aaron Jiang</p>\n<p>Shutong Wu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T06:06:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5f/b5f36389bcd952c73929657637118898.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fizzytheballoon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
