The challenging room by room puzzles will give you the drive to have \"one more go\" and make it to the next door.<br/></p><p><strong>UPDATE </strong>- Thanks to some great feedback - a quick note. Wall jumping works with the left stick or left/right arrow keys only. You DO NOT need to use the jump button to wall jump.</p>Features<ul><li>90 rock hard levels</li><li>Jump, air jump and double jump to solve puzzles</li><li>Awesome chiptune soundtrack</li><li>Pixellated blood (if you like that sort of thing)</li></ul><p>**This is the BETA version of Blake Strongflank, the full version will include 100 levels and the challenge modes.**<br/></p><p><strong>NOTE</strong> Game is optimised for 360 controllers.
