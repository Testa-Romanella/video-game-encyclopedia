You will need to synchronize body, player one, and mind, player two, to achieve your goals and complete your passage. The two can only communicate within the game, no talking or mimics allowed.</p>\n<p>Passage was made for the Global Game Jam 2016 event in 48 hours.</p>\n<p>Some instructions aren't very clear; you can check out your stats by moving your mouse to the left corner of the screen. These stats update quite frequently, though the game doesn't alert you about it, so it's a good thing to keep an eye on it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/466/4669c54041a3ef5e782de83322fb0e20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Melancia Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
