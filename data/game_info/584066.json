While making this I am trying to stick to the methods used back in the day, and as a result it uses very little resources and will run on almost anything. There is not much content yet, mostly everything is there for testing the engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I was inspired by classic shooters like Doom. I read a bunch of raycasting tutorials and breakdowns\u00a0of the source code from the classics. Thanks to Lode and 3DSage for their exceptionally awesome tutorials. Also thanks to Gustavo Franco for the enemy pathing algorithms.</p>\n<p>Note: It should be fine, but\u00a0I have not had a chance to test the Linux or OSX builds yet.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T02:15:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60e/60ecf1e2192a37cc85e6d187e3fcfdea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
