You only know that you have to continue exploring the dungeon until you kill the boss, don't die! (In hardcore versions you only have one chance to win, if you die you'll be forced to close the game).</p>\n<p>Enemies way to attack is based in oasis stand of jojo's bizarre adventure part 5: vento aureo (I'm not an artist so a little of imagination helps XD).</p>\n<p>This game was made in the span of 3 days for a game jam by an almost completly beginner in making games so I did my best to make something funny, I hope you enjoy it! :D</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>- awsd/arrow keys: Movement</p>\n<p>- left click: Attack\u00a0</p>\n<p>- left shift/left control: Dash</p>\n<p>V1.0 Advise: Don't try to restart the game from itself, you have to exit it to restart it well. Plus this version was submitted inside the 72 hour span of the game jam, V1.1 has bug fixes and a little more feedback but they've been made\u00a0after the jam ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T09:00:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3e0bdbb76d75e3453150eabe95d51f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Lix\u00edvia"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
