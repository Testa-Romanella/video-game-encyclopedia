He might get a little angry if you don't find the right one, so choose wisely!<br/></p>\n<p>Headless Hollow was developed within 72 hours by myself and mknightdev using Unity and was made for the Mini Jam #89: Pumpkin. <br/></p>\n<p>Feedback is greatly appreciated and will be taken into account for future game jams and projects.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around.</li><li>Walk up to a pumpkin and press 'E' to pick it up!</li><li>You must take the pumpkin back to the portal and the Horseman will decide if the head is correct.</li></ul>\r\nDevelopers' Notes\r\n<p>Doing this game jam was a great experience for the both of us, as it was our very first one to be a part of and was a lot of fun! This was a great chance for the both of us to put our game development skills into practice because of the time limit, working in a team and being given a theme and limitation. <br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game and hope to be a part of more jams in the future. <br/></p>\n<p>- mknightdev &amp; tcarter (MiqCarti Studios)<br/></p>\r\nCredits/Assets\r\nFirst-Party\r\n<strong>mknightdev</strong><br/><strong>tcarter</strong>ProgrammingLevel Design<br/>3D Modelling*<br/>Voice Acting<br/><br/>UI<br/><br/>Story<br/>3D Modelling*<br/>VFX\u00a0\r\n<p>* Only a few models were created by us, the rest are from asset packs as we wanted to focus on giving us enough time to execute the idea and the time pressure rather than creating everything from scratch.
