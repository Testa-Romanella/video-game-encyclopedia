There's not really much in the way of triangles, unless you count mesh rendering.</p>\n<p><strong>Synopsis</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You are\u00a0<em>MegaChicken</em>. You awaken to find yourself 6 feet tall, intelligent and ready to hit things. There's a cauldron next to you, which may explain why you have suddenly gained chicken super-powers.</p>\n<p>You are joined by your friend\u00a0<em>Henry</em>, an adorable golden retriever.\u00a0 Together, you talk to chickens and battle monsters in your quest for the golden egg. If you find the egg, you win the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can move with the cursor keys, or WASD. SPACE interacts with whatever object you are currently facing (hay/grain heals you). J jumps.</p>\n<p>You will automatically bash any hostile creature that approaches you.</p>\n<p>Defeating enemies increases both your health and your size.</p>\n<p><strong>Links</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can play the WASM version online:\u00a0https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/megachicken/<br/></p>\n<p>Source code is here:\u00a0https://github.com/thebracket/rusty-jam-2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T12:29:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ab/0ab381bc82982cb973a03d10ad6f0bd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Bracket"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
