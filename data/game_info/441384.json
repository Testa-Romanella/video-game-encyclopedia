You can find it at www.parsecgaming.com. (You can also play a two-player game over Zoom using remote control, but it might introduce some lag for one player.)</em></p>\n<p>Couch Breakout is a chaotic competitive arcade game for 2-6 players who are virtually sharing a keyboard. Each player uses a pair of keys to move their paddle and scores points by bouncing the ball off bricks and bumpers. When all the bricks are gone, the highest score wins!</p>\n<p>This game was created for the students in my Spring 2020 Experimental Game Topics class, all of whom did fantastic, creative, and thoughtful work during the semester, despite the hardships imposed by COVID-19. I wanted to make a game that they could play together while socially distanced, using one of the tools that we made use of during the class. Thanks for the great semester, everyone!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:54:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b6/9b6fae510e6993e02beab28cffd34884.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sean Bouchard Bloom"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
