ChangeScene seems to not do what I\u00a0think it does.</p>\n<p>2) There's a chance if there's no enemies on screen, no new enemies will spawn. I tried to get all the edge cases, but I\u00a0may have missed some.</p>\n<p>3) The game is random and limited in wave patterns, I\u00a0ran out of time. So scoring is a bit up to luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T08:34:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/9695c3ed8e1cc0084b07e5232d77b2d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["s1lv3r dr4g0n"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
