Journeys down this strange and eerie road are generally solitary ones, but this proves not to be the case on this particular day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You spy by the side of the road a strange figure, who appears to need a lift. On a whim, you decide to indulge them. Only once they have gotten into your car, they seem very interested in finding out more about you, your life...and what has brought you to the road. Converse with the Hitcher, decide what to ask them, and how to respond to what they ask you in return. Maybe, though, you want to consider carefully how much you give away.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0ASSETS USED:</p>\n\n<p>Super Character Controller: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/character-controller-super-135316</p>\n<p>Toon Gas Station: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/toon-gas-station-155369</p>\n<p>Ink: https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/</p>\n<p>Low Poly Car Interior: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/lowpoly-car-interior-ede5072b3e54486481f8d06eba09d853</p><p>Toon Shader: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/toon-shader-fx-150115</p>\n<p>Skybox: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/10-skyboxes-pack-day-night-32236#content</p>\n<p>Car Engine SFX: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/inside-car-noise-while-driving-29978/</p>\n<p>Car Pulling Up SFX: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/car-arriving-idling-and-pulling-away-6100/</p>\n<p>Car Window SFX: https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/car/</p>\n<p>Music Track (Intro): https://pixabay.com/music/beats-beat-tape-dog-eat-dog-140846/</p>\n<p>Music Track (Outro): https://pixabay.com/music/beats-beat-tape-glow-beyond-140842/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T14:01:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a334435d2dc58ee088309dc880b3972.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joshy McBride's House of Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
