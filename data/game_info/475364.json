Your goal is to pollinate all the flowers in the field. Unfortunately, your minions are lazy and will only pollinate\u00a0flowers within close proximity of their hives. You have a limited number of beehives, so place them wisely to achieve field domination.<br/></p>\n<p>Plant flowers in empty soil\u00a0by pressing P. Some patches of soil are better than others and will grow more flowers. Beware, once you\u2019ve planted a flower in a patch, you cannot place a beehive there, so choose where to plant carefully.</p>\n<p>Place a beehive in empty soil\u00a0by pressing E. When you place a beehive, that beehive\u2019s workers will harvest 1 flower from each patch around the hive. The game ends once you have placed all of your beehives or if you run out of empty soil patches.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: When playing in the browser on some screens\u00a0the game is zoomed in weirdly - to fix,\u00a0zoom in/out on the page until it looks right (or download and play the Windows exe instead).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:37:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/995/995895e547c784768b4d7652cfc76946.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["jalarimar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
