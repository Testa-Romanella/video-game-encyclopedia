This is something to take into account when playing, both attacking and defending, and it is something you should know if you want to win.<br/>\r\nCharacters look for the nearest enemy and attack it. Otherwise, if the enemy is out of range, they will attack the castle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can select a unit and deploy it in the battle arena.
