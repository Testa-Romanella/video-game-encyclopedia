You\u2019ll want to pay close attention to your surroundings as some locations may offer clues as to what steps are needed to escape the recurring day.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Due to the friendly nature of the locals you\u2019ll find that many people are willing to engage in a conversation with you. One of the main features of the game is player driven dialogue, so you\u2019ll be able to choose Henry\u2019s responses in certain scenarios.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some locals may give you items if they like you or if you help them.
