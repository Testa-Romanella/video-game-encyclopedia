{"id": 682394, "slug": "totto", "name": "TOTTO!", "name_original": "TOTTO!", "description": "<p>\u201cTotto!\u201d is an arcade game for Commodore C=64, Commodore VIC-20 (with expansion memory installed), Commodore PLUS/4, Commodore C=128, MSX 1, Memotech 500, Gameboy (Classic) and LM80C Color Computer (32KB), written in a short time thanks to the primitives made available by the\u00a0\"midres\" library.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The game participates in the\u00a0challenge of Retro Programmers Inside.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The game is a \u201cremake\u201d of the\u00a0Flappy Bird\u00a0game, whose modern gameplay is also\u00a0accessible online.\r\n</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to win all 99 levels by passing the bird through the openings in the pipes. The reward is viewing one of the four final screens.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each level has a certain number of pipes: every two levels, the number of pipes increases by one unit. The maximum number of pipes is 20 (per level). When the bird passes a pipe through the opening, its score increases by 1.\r\n</p>\n<p>Every ten levels also increases the speed of the bird, and this makes the game more and more difficult, because there is less room to maneuver, in order to cross the gaps. Infact, the gaps must be crossed with the maximum possible distance, under penalty of a \u201cgame over\u201d.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player controls the bird using any key on the keyboard. When the button is pressed, the bird accelerates upwards. When the player released it, the bird will gradually decrease its vertical speed, until it begins a slow but steady descent. To maintain the altitude it is therefore necessary to give regular \u201cstrokes\u201d to the keyboard. To increase it, you need to hold down the key. To decrease it, simply wait, without pressing any key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8dae076184c5f7b9f0ee294bfac85eee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spotlessmind1975"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
