Originally started as a prototype for my DePaul University class GAM 355: Solo Game Development. It is a World War 1 trench game where players create trenches to advance their troops towards the enemy base.  </p><p>This is the most current build but I will try and keep it updated with new ones as I work towards the end. </p><p>There is stand in audio and art for now. Not all of the art or audio assets were created by myself. For example - Bullet for my valentine \"Scream, Aim, Fire\", the tile screen image I got off of a Google image search as well as all of the textures. All of the audio I got from YouTube and reworked them a bit in Audacity.  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4ab3de263da175242aeb70047ddc2c0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Novosel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
