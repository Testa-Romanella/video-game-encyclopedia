He leaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands, counting the beats of his temples. The cabin door opened and he saw the Hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDaybreak, gentlemen!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0-\u00a0James Joyce, \"After the Race\"</p>\n<p>What a strange time it is, the dawn: too late to be lively, too early to be dead. When sordid silhouettes play Bach with their bodies\u2014in nightclubs, in cafe windows.\u00a0The time when they\u00a0interweave then retire, and at last return to their rooms on the cusp of a dream.\u00a0And yes,\u00a0 what a splendid dream it will be: a mixing of bodies with souls bleeding boldly, and minds boldly bleeding out stories unfolding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yes, yes yes: this is a game about a city at dawn\u00a0where nothing has quite made sense for at least six hours, or maybe six-thousand years. It's a little world that you can visit when you desperately need to make friends with the devil.\u00a0It's a shopping mall riot and night in the woods,\u00a0a magic circle and an electrical fire.\u00a0It's PAGAN.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0game is quite short, and once you interact with the final object\u00a0(trust me, you'll know which one it is) it will end quite abruptly. Make sure you're ready to finish playing\u2014and satisfied that you'll get the ending you want\u2014before you do so. Usually, it's the case that you can end the game quite a\u00a0while before you've seen everything in it. It's up to you to decide when you feel that you're done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Many thanks, and enjoy the devilCity,</p>\n<p>-OleanderGarden</p>\n<p>(P.S. if you, for some strange reason, are interested in seeing my films/music/other-garbage, you can find it on\u00a0https://oleandergarden.neocities.org/)<br/></p>\n<p>(P.P.S.
