Dinnae Ken Games is a one-man operation, so all art and coding was done solo in a short amount of time.</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam was \"Seeing is Believing\" and the idea behind this game is that you shouldn't believe everything you see on the news, unlike our main character, who is affected by the things he sees on TV, both good and bad.</p>\n\n<p>The tutorial and some build settings were created outside of the jam in order to get the game in relatively good working order so we can get a version here on itch.io. This version, whilst working and complete ( to some extent), could certainly use refinement, some additional quality of life features and just general expansion, however there are no immediate plans to continue the development of the game.</p>\n<p>But you never know... <em>Watch This Space</em>...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-29T03:43:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d80/d803c429951f233655a9dcd8cab53ea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dinnae Ken Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
