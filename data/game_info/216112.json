You don't have a lot of battery so use it wisely: try to line them up in each shoot. All the controls are in the tutorial level, you should have no problem picking them up.</p>\n<p>This is quick patch for my GMTK entry, LostSoul,\u00a0that I did a bit\u00a0after the deadline. If you play the jam version, you cannot get to the end of the game.\u00a0List of bugs fixed is as follow:</p>\n<ul><li>Not enough ghosts spawn: you cannot pass level 2</li><li>Ghosts spawned outside the walking zone: cannot be captured, cannot pass level.</li><li>Text in tutorial is not displayed incorrectly.</li><li>Ghosts animation is off (during testing).</li><li>Zoom indicator was incorrect.</li></ul>\n<p>That's about it. And I also exported a web build, the export is done way after the deadline but nothing is added.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/65698eef000d3f81f178ea010f5e9a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nam Nguyen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
