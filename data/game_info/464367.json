The jerks are intended to emulate a \"Twitch Plays\" type scenario where the game is taking inputs from multiple sources and lets majority rule. <br/><br/>We just didn't have time to get Multi-player implemented.<br/><br/>The game is controlled by using W, A, S, D to \"Vote\" on which direction you want to tilt the board. The Jerks are also voting (randomly)\u00a0making it difficult to maintain any type of control. Don't get Tilted!<br/><br/>You can use the sliders on the left side of the screen to change the number of jerks voting during the round, as well as how much their votes are weighted vs yours (The player's has a weight of 1)\u00a0The default values are the intended \"difficulty?\" <br/><br/>If you change the number of jerks to 0, then you'll only have yourself to blame for messing it up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's two maps to play on intended for slightly different styles.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Survival Map<ul><li>\u00a0Try to keep the Jerks from putting the balls into the holes for as long as possible</li><li>Alternatively pick your favorite ball and try to keep that specific ball alive longer than all the other balls.\u00a0</li><li>The round ends when there's only one ball remaining</li></ul></li><li>Race Map<ul><li>Try to get the balls to the big hole at the bottom of the map as quickly as possible, but watch out or the jerks don't tilt your balls\u00a0\u00a0into the smaller holes around the map!</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p><p>W to vote North<br/>A to vote West<br/>S to vote South<br/>D to vote East</p><p>Esc will always return you to the menu</p><p>R will instantly restart the current game round.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><ul><li>Game/Level Design: Jacob Beaman</li><li>Game Design/Programming: Bobby Elser</li><li>Programming: Mike Schreiber</li><li>Programming: Brian Alvarado</li><li>Programming: Marcus L.
