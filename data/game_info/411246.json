He knew this was going to happen and yet he continued to eat food that wasn't good for him.</p>\n<p>After waking up he told the doctor his experience and what he saw....</p>\n\n<p><strong>Side note:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This was a project I made for a friend who passed away 3 years ago. This project was literally the only thing keeping my mind at ease during that time.\u00a0 Anyways enjoy the game. There is 3 endings to the game. The Bad end, where you basically don't care. The Fake end where you play the game normally which is MY real end to the story. At last the True end which is what actually happened where you worked hard to reach out to your (his) wife.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4de/4de38e5d8a2727ed4c5d54451b2abb02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PurpleGamesStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
