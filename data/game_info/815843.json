He must go through the trials in heaven, with many pillars in his way. How far can he go?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a flappy bird-like game. Mechanics below:</p>\n<ul><li>Press Cheese (Play) button to start (or restart)</li><li>Press keys or\u00a0tap to keep mouse flying while avoiding the pillar.</li><li>Game over once the mouse hit any pillar or the cloud ground.</li></ul>\n<p>To make mouse fly / move upwards:</p>\n<ul><li>PC - use <strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> or <strong>Space</strong>\u00a0key</li><li>Mobile - Tap (<strong>Touch</strong>) anywhere on screen</li></ul>\n\n<p>This is my first game (done by following tutorials), my first step/experiment in game dev. Hopefully, this game will be updated with more features or gameplay mechanics as I learn more about game development.<br/></p>\n<p>P.S.
