{"id": 324663, "slug": "jessikas-curse", "name": "Jessika's Curse", "name_original": "Jessika's Curse", "description": "Jessika\u2019s Curse is a hand-painted RPG experience currently development on Patreon. Its design allows for deep turn-based combat, erotic Battle-Lust animations and good dose of geeky humor.\r\n<p>The core of Jessika\u2019s Curse will be turn-based combat that marries classic Jrpg concepts with elements from more recent roguelike games such as Darkest Dungeon. All characters in the game and all their moves and Battle-Lust interactions will be animated by hand in Spine: 2D, and the ones we\u2019ve done so far promise that the game is going to look very sweet.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>We want success in combat to require a good dose of preparation and smart configuration, but will also design it to allow personal preference and playstyle to thrive. Each character in your party can equip a limited amount of skills from her pool, and it\u2019s up to you to figure out what combinations get the job done.</p>\n\n<p>The world of Jessika\u2019s Curse is a sexy and seductive place, and many attacks don\u2019t assault your party\u2019s health but target their lust instead. If a girl\u2019s lust becomes too high there is a good chance your commands will be ignored in favor of less constructive things (those boobs aren\u2019t going to squeeze themselves...). The times when this happens it will be done via lavish hand-crafted animations. When lust gets to maximum levels enemies will use a special lust cinematic to knock the girl out in fitting H-game style.</p>\r\nCORE FEATURES\r\n<p><strong>Battle Lust</strong><br/>\r\nThe attacks from the game\u2019s monsters often don\u2019t assault your party\u2019s health, but target their lust instead. When lust gets too high the party members will succumb to their desires and start doing naughty things!</p>\n<p><strong>Challenging Gameplay</strong><br/>\r\nWe\u2019re inspired by games that offer a real gameplay challenge. Success in Jessika\u2019s Curse will require a good dose of pre-combat preparation, as each character in your party can only equip a limited amount of skills from her pool.</p>\n<p><strong>A world ruled by dark Deities</strong><br/>\r\nThe world of Jessika\u2019s Curse is shaped by twisted Deities. Our inspiration for this comes from things like Warhammer\u2019s Gods of Chaos, which means the game world will be filled with unnatural hentai-esque madness.</p>\n<p><strong>Other features</strong><br/>\r\n\u2022 Hand-painted characters animated in Spine: 2D<br/>\r\n\u2022 A ton of explicit animations per party member (often involving enemies)<br/>\r\n\u2022 Beautiful side-scrolling backgrounds in the style of Dragon\u2019s Crown<br/>\r\n\u2022 A town that grows in size and epicness</p>\r\nLINKS\r\n<p><em>\u2022 Patreon is our main income source.
