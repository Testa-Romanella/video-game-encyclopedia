You can play by yourself (which may be boring) or play with others! The controls for this game are extremely simple only requiring your mouse to control your pogo sticking character, however the game has a frustrating aspect to it similar to the game \"Getting Over It\". I hope you enjoy this challenge and have fun playing with your friends!\u00a0\u00a0:D</p>\n<p>During the week from January 1st until January 8th 2023, the community of my discord are able to submit their own characters into the game! If you'd like you can also create and submit your own characters for the game during this week here in the discord -&gt;\u00a0https://discord.gg/wWeyVUtYxC</p>\n\n<p>PS: The game currently only runs on Windows. This will be fixed tomorrow!\u00a0(:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T06:09:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e36280897ba8529b4247a560aaeed82b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timmy_Little"], "genres": ["Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
