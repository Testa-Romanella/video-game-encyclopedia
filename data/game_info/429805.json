First of, watch out for your harvesters. Create safe paths for them, so they don't run into some alien robot's arms.\u00a0Oh, and you better avoid those explosive barrels, too. Or don't and use them to set up a trap. Anyways, in case things get hairy, you can send your rangers out as backup. Even in the heat of battle though,\u00a0never lose sight of your goal. Find suitable locations for new colonies and send your astronaut teams out to set them up. Good luck, commander!</em></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Unique mix of turn-based &amp; real-time strategy!\u00a0</strong>Think on your feet and time your moves, but don't fiddle with unit micro-management.</li><li><strong>Random generation!\u00a0</strong>Face a new level layout each match.
