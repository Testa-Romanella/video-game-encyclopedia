BE THE FIRST TO TRY IT OUT!</em><br/></p>\n<p>As you soon found out, laser vision is too good to be true. Rope vision, however, is not. Being the only person that made it to the testing room, you get to try out rope vision, and solve puzzles with the help of physics. This game is short yet difficult, and contains a good ending, a bad ending, and an easter egg ending.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls (These are hard to read in-game):</strong></p>\n<p>M - Mute Music (I highly recommend you do this)</p>\n<p>N - Skip Level</p>\n<p><strong>Movement</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys - Move</p>\n<p>A/Up arrow/Space - Space</p>\n<p>R - Restart</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Rope Vision</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left click - Connect</p>\n<p>Right click - Cancel</p>\n<p>Q - Release all connections</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:14:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e18/e186e36fee333761df9dca4c6ac3377c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eebe"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
