It was my first jam and I learnt so much from it! I did most of the art assets. The game focuses on Tim's morning journey to work and the annoying commuters that stand in his way. Can be played with xbox controller or keyboard. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/494/494585ebe1c97d07508a87401f28eb91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MajesticLamb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
