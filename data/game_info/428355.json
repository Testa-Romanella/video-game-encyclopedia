My goal is to not have the game in Early Access for more than 4 years.)</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T15:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de0/de042b179a33d45bd71a58afdce9dd1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smartly Gophered Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Smartly Gophered Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
