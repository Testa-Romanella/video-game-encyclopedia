I apreciate every piece of feedback you can give me!</p>\n<p>Full devlog here:</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/t/742442/i-need-a-name-for-my-game-asap-<br/></p>\n\n<p>For the moment,\u00a0<strong>Final Fanta-Three</strong>\u00a0(name still in beta) is just a quirky, classic Game Boy styled,\u00a0two buttoned mini-game.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>You take\u00a0control of these three classic fantasy heroes: an archer, a mage and a knight (totally not a cliche), to kick\u00a0 some randomly generated waves of monster butts!</p>\n\r\nTHE GAMEPLAY:\r\n<p>The main mechanic of the mini-game is: One button to change the character in a secuence (Knight, Mage, Archer) and one button to attack. Thats prety much it, you change characters and you attack your foes.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>THE KNIGHT:</strong></p>\n<p>He can obviusly attack meelee only, so he is the most limited of the three, but don\u00b4t think he is weak. He can one-shot every enemy (as long as it\u00b4s in ftont of him), and his mighty shield can deflect all enemy projectile, so he is great for defense.\u00a0 His powerfull sword is also the only weapon that can reach the floor, so only he\u00a0can kill small enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>THE MAGE:</strong></p>\n<p>He can shoot fire balls bro! His attack is not as powerfull as the knights, but he can attack from a safe distance.\u00a0<em>\"Lets just spam fireball and get this thig over with already\"\u00a0</em>he thought\u00a0when he joined the adventure. Unfortunately for him there are enemies with magic shields invulnerable to his spells. He can\u00b4t attack smaller or flying enemies either.</p>\n<p><strong>THE ARCHER:</strong></p>\n<p>He is the only one that can kill flying enemies and get the flying rewards. The whole team would be absolutely screwed without him, but he is completely vulnerable to evething right in front of his face. You have to take care of him.</p>\n\r\nA LITTLE ABOUT ME:\r\n<p>In december 2019 I didn\u00b4t know how to code (or anything about programming), I didn\u00b4t know how to draw (or how to even use Photoshop or Gimp), I didn\u00b4t know how to make animations,\u00a0I didn\u00b4t know how to make music at all and I barely knew how to speak english... Now I still don\u00b4t know how to do any of those, but hey, at least im trying my best right? One thing is for sure, I really, REALLY love videogames.</p>\n<p>When 2020\u00a0 started I decided I was fed up with my desk job and started learning my passion in my free time (hopely in a future i can quit this dreadfull job). When COVID-19 quarantine started i suddenly had all this time I didnt know what to do with, so I started dedicating myself completely to learning unity and C#.</p>\n<p>I would apreciate every piece of advice and critique, and I sincerly hope you like the idea and that you play and enjoy the game when its out :)</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your support!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T09:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53f/53ff4f39ef0cb8612ca099f6ffb121ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sepi.gamedev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
