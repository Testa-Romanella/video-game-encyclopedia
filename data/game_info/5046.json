Along the way, they just might have to save the world from the evil Arbitus and his band of demons. It&#39;ll take brains as well as brawn to win the day, though; the grid-based combat challenges players to think strategically and make the best use of each character&#39;s unique skills and abilities. The strategy doesn&#39;t end there, though! Players can spend their hard-earned cash to set up the game&#39;s<br />\nrandomized dungeons to their liking; choose the terrain, the size of the dungeon, and the monsters that you&#39;ll face. Play it safe, or take on bigger risks for even greater rewards! Your adventure is in your hands!</p>", "metacritic": 58, "released": "2008-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T06:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ba8/ba803db56778a48bc75fe11688ede53c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["Global A Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Natsume"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
