Doubloons gained are based off of your speed when enemies are killed so swing as fast as possible when you strike your foes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Art Direction</strong><br/></p>\n<p>To achieve the worst art possible, we made a list of all of the art assets and randomly assigned them to different programmers to create in mspaint with a mouse. No collaboration was allowed during asset creation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because art is not limited to graphics alone, we used a very fancy Blue Yeti microphone to record the entire original OST played on the recorder.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T03:49:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df32feade17ecce46b388b85f4327165.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ngrayson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
