Frustrated by the lack of answers in their work life, the player sets out to find a coffee shop to take a reluctant break. Since it is a fairly new shop and they don't know the way, the player asks for help from civilians. I added conditional dialogue for the player's coworker based on if there is coffee variable in the player's inventory since it was a request to grab two cups. This game is a cute and quick playthrough to remind yourself to take it easy.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Made by me with the Bitsy editor!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T11:24:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/730/7300fe55f6bb3c56beaf87bc559d27ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madelinerogers"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
