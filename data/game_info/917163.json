These were all glued together into an experience\u00a0that hopefully\u00a0feels like exploring a dream.</p>\n<p>CONTENT WARNING:<br/></p>\n<p>Due to the subject matter, there are some descriptions of violence and coarse language.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T08:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2b5a0d38cb228645b8f3e3c3d49ace.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Potterfield"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
