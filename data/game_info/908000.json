A target can either be a monster you need to kill, or a resource. In fact, there's trees and boulders on the map that each soldier can shoot down to gather materials used to build.</p>\n<p>You can choose to build from a set of structures:</p>\n<ul><li>Barricade: Acts as a wall, destructible.</li><li>Trap: Stops the unit walking on it from going any further during its turn, 1 time usage.</li><li>Turret: Spawns a new unit that can shoot every turn (controlled by the player).</li></ul>\n<p>You'll need to find the best possible defense strategies in order to survive !</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n<p>Mathieu Schmerber: Design, Programming, Art</p>\n<p>With the help of the POLYGON CHARACTER PACK\u00a0asset, I did not create the characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T08:47:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/028/0289ccf430425dc9e4396d89e9fe870c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mathieu Schmerber"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
