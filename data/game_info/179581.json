But look around you. They&#39;re not the only four things, are they? Turns out, it&#39;s entirely possible to make all of the other things by combining those four things, then combining the new things and so on until you have all the things! If you ignore rudimentary science and all common sense, anyway.<br />\nThis is in a very early state currently - crafting recipes will be tweaked as I get feedback, and missing item art and further items and categories shall be added as time goes on. Much further down the line, I aim to add music and release an Android version on the Google Play Store.<br />\nIf you have any comments on the functionality, features or feel some of the recipes could be made more logical, or if you run into any issues, then let me know! I&#39;m open to any and all suggestions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-18T23:55:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c02/c02a0c98e873c3912b3fcc5aba5e7a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Daniel Ilett"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
