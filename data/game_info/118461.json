Cornered by the abuse of his father, unable to go to the police, he wants to look for a way out of his situation. Then he meets the new guy who just moved into town... Ray.</p>\n<p>The game is 10-15 minutes long with two endings, both endings have two different versions.<br/>There is not much gameplay as it's solely story driven.</p>\n<p>For those who played Crimson Light, this was made prior to that, but chronologically its way later. I will not expand on the story of this short because of its length.<br/>I've decided to upload it here too because I plan to collectively have all my projects here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/679/67989fec85a86581b8326723ab08bb38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nandee"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
