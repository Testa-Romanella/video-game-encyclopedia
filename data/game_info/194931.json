Unfortunately I couldn't finish like I intended to do. The goal of this prototype is to destroy all the rocket towers with the help of the four elements. Fire attacks an enemy in a short range, Water blocks bullets, Wind blows enemies in a short range away, Earth lets rocks fall from heaven and makes damage to all enemies on the screen (Wind hasn't been implemented in this version yet). At first I intended to implement walking enemies aswell but I ran out of time.</p><p>You have to click on the game, before you can start the game.
