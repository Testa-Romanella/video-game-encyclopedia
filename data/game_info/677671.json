Your task: survive and escape Backrooms.</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy walking (and sometimes panic running) simulator with major focus on level generation inspired by well-known in certain circles picture and description. Please note it is my interpretation that goes in decidedly different direction than majority of lore surrounding Backrooms.</p>\n<p> One level. One entity. Just you and progressing <strong>monoyellow madness</strong>. It is all about experience.<br/></p>\n<p>This is hobby game - it was made as way to learn Unreal Engine for myself. Somewhere on the way things got a little out of hand and this learning experience became full-fledged project.</p>\n<p>This is 1.0.0 release. Game is considered complete. Any future releases will be only for fixing bugs\u00a0and/or optimizations.</p>\n<p>Please note that due to it's nature (procedural generation and fully dynamic lights) game is not suitable for low end computers.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Level 0 - one that we all know and love.</li><li>Procedurally generated area - every run is unique. Most complex algorithm for single level generation used among Backrooms games.</li><li>Infinitely large area to play on.</li><li>The longer you are exploring, the worse it gets.</li><li>Deadly hide-and-seek with Entity.</li></ul>\n<p>Contact:</p>\n<ul><li>I have discord server MaderLand. It features devlog, so if you want to track progress of game development, join!</li><li>I am also on general discord server dedicated to Backrooms r/thebackrooms and on some other Backrooms-related servers.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T05:08:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/896/8968525749731b3f31f405ad5f126b0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mader Levap"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
