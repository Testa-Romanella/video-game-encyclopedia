For the reveal of one of my alt models, I went WAY overboard and made an entire (short and basic) first person game. It's heavily inspired by things like ENA, LSD Dream Emulator and early 90's computer software experimenting with 3D. It's simple and unrefined, but I hope it can be enjoyable for a minute or two :&gt;</p><p>Controls:<br/>- WASD to move<br/>- Mouse to look around<br/>- E to interact<br/>- Ctrl to crouch<br/>- Shift to walk<br/></p>\n<p>(some credits here)<br/>Greenclonk - coding the interactivity<br/>Thanks to, in order, Mistral, Pikuselu and Spoofen for the art featured in the final area of the game<br/>And thank you to Oliver Buckland for permission to use their music.
