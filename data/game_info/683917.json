This game is open-source on GitHub.</strong></p>\n<p>You are an adorable kitten and you've just moved into your new home - how exciting! Wouldn't it be a shame if you went on a mug-breaking, shelf-clearing spree of destruction...?</p>\n<p>Run and jump around procedurally-generated rooms, causing chaos by\u00a0emptying as many rooms as you can in a strict time limit. Swipe objects off beds, shelves, and tables, maximising the efficiency of your route so you can return to the cat flap and move to the next room as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!
