{"id": 399840, "slug": "guidance", "name": "Guidance", "name_original": "Guidance", "description": "<p>Guidance is a modern riff on the classic God-Game (such as Black and White). What makes Guidance unique compared to other god games is that it has many RPG elements and you only have limited influence over the world and a single character, rather than large groups or regions. In this world the player is an external force/ entity\u00a0 that is trying to guide a character in order to influence the world. The player does not have full control over the character like traditional games. Instead, the player must try and guide the character in order to achieve their goals by giving them ques within the world and then the character AI decides whether or not they wish to obey. This adds an underlying design theme centered around chaotic gameplay.</p>\r\nDesign Pillars\r\n<ul><li>Advanced AI Interactions</li><li>Chaotic decision making</li><li>Exploration</li><li>God Complex</li><li>Isometric view</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:48:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d1/2d123ff7bdc1015cff944abc09f761ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grimboldorf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
