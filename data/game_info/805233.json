Try to be mindful of which enemy is required to progress and watch out for hazards!</p>\n<p>Controllers should work with the game, although be aware X-Input ones are recommended and right now there's only button prompts for Keyboard, Xbox, and PlayStation controllers.</p>\n<p>Pressing the R key (or the select button on a controller) will reset the current level, though be aware any retries will be included in the results at the end of the demo.</p>\n<p>If you want a challenge, try to collect as many coins and golden bills as possible without dying or resetting as quickly as you can. Though how you play is up to you!</p>\n<p>Use Alt+Enter (in the downloadable Windows version) or F11 (in the downloadable Linux version) to make the game fullscreen.</p>\n<p>F1 will bring you to level select and the O and P keys can be used to raise/lower the water on Level 1-5. These are mainly for testing purposes, but I thought I'd leave them in for people to mess with!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T13:50:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03b/03b1db2e9361ad2ee87735051ddd320e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Turbowave Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
