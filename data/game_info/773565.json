Synchronize your movements with the rhythm. Show your skills on the dance floor. Push enemies. Be the only remaining competitor. Made with great effort by a team of 5 talented people (and special thanks to Darlan and Johny for the teaser work and additional music track) , passionate about games. At the moment we don't have the financial support to go beyond a demo, but each of us gave our heart and soul to the project and we are very proud of the result. We hope you have a lot of fun with the original concept that came out of our dedicated work.<br/></p><p>Made by some brazilian guys:</p><ul><li>Andr\u00e9 Ten\u00f3rio</li><li>Francisco Matias</li><li>Lucas Oliveira</li><li>Marcos Pereira</li><li>Vitor Malcher<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T15:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/403/40394eed0398924c84272c8e54c8d276.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["marcosrpjr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
