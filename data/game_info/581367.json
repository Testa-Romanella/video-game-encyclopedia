This game explores most of the said habitable discovered planets in the universe. The Conveyor is tasked with the objective of securing the planets for man and mankind. The first Chapter is based on the TRAPPIST SYSTEM. This game was inspired by Elon Musk's SPACEX Mars project and NASA's Moon landing. TRAPPIST-1e, also designated as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 e, is a solid, close-to-Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone around the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 approximately 40 light-years (12 parsecs), or nearly 3.7336\u00d71014 km) away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. It was one of seven new exoplanets discovered orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope.[4] Three of the seven (e, f, and g) are in the habitable zone.[5][6] TRAPPIST-1e is similar to Earth's mass, radius, density, gravity, temperature, and stellar flux.[1][2] It is also confirmed to have a compact atmosphere like the terrestrial planets in our solar system.[7] In November 2018, researchers determined that of the seven exoplanets in the multiplanetary system, TRAPPIST-1e is the one with the greatest chance of being an Earth-like ocean planet and the one most worthy of further study with regard to habitability.[8] According to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog, TRAPPIST-1e is one of the most potentially habitable exoplanets discovered so far.[9] Based on future events.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T13:58:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8b/f8b6b6202441a76f92a191c2990a0d25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ClawScratchGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
