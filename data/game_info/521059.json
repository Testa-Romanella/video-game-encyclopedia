So it\u2019s called \u201cOwl ridge\u201d instead. It\u2019s an 8 bit-ish thing inspired by Monkey Island, Twin Peaks and Wake in Fright. All of which you should check out if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s mostly dialogue with obscure references and is specifically designed to be frustrating to play. Oh and if you get to a screen where it says \u201cinsert disk 2\u201d. There is no disk 2! I haven\u2019t made it yet. Congrats you\u2019ve completed part 1. It\u2019s a just a sneak peek at a larger story that will eventually emerge from the strangeness. If you like it let me know, and maybe I\u2019ll make it. <br/></p>\n<p>Download below, or play the 'Owl-light' version in your browser.</p>\n<p>Go easy on me, this is my first game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4ff8867c78ab4a87b3e5c12504121f03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OwlRidge86"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
