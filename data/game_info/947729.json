However, his new boss <em>The Tamerlane</em> will not let him retire in peace; instead, he has assigned Fred with his most difficult assignment yet!</p>\n<p>Fred's new target is Toby, a born loser who has never had a relationship in his life, and always finds the wrong words to say to a girl.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fred's mission is to whisper the right words in Toby's ear, and help him find the girl of his dreams.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, the \"meat\" of the story happens in the background, as Toby stumbles his way through life, and talks to girl after girl. Fred can observe the people around Toby and their environment, and during the climax of each level, the player must manually enter these words for Toby to hear, and (hopefully) get a real date.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Combining point &amp; click gameplay with typing elements inspired by such games as <em>The Typing of the Dead</em>, <em>A Fool for Love</em> is a lighthearted and quirky NSFW adventure.</p>\n<p>Having run into some very difficult technical issues a while ago, development on this game was halted. Given that the game was started back in 2012, certain elements and dialogs need to also be updated for more modern sensibilities before development resumes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T12:58:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a50/a5044e3f5dccb1c142c7f970042903f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erdalion"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
