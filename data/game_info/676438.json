That's why I made the theme Tortoise and the Hare.</p>\n<p>There are in-game instructions, but to move the Tortoise forward, repeatedly click the briefcase. Then when the Inner Demons show up, click them repeatedly to banish them. Click the self-care icons to eventually level up your click damage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:18:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8de/8de878263a5077cd9b0f4402ab74bb09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Noah Wizard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
