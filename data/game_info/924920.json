You won't be able to see yourself, but the farmers will plant seeds and you'll help them grow as you move around.</p>\n<p>Undock the crank to resurface so you can eat fully grown berries. Watch out, though, cause the farmers will come after you! <br/></p>\n<p>Other tips: As you collect berries, more farmers will spawn. \u00a0If you spend too much time underground, it'll take longer to dig after you surface.  The screen wraps for you, but not for the farmers. Every 4 berries will spawn a new farmer, and every 8 will spawn an Evil Farmer who will stomp crops to get to you!</p>\n<p>Sound, music, and coding by James Gameboy.</p>\n<p>Art and concept design by Lady Celery.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T18:36:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83d/83db86ce0162b38c251ede223f8af241.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Gameboy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
