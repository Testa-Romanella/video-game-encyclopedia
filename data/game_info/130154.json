Pfft.</p><p>Winner of the \"Best Multiplayer\" award at the New York Gamecraft Game Jam, <em>PLAY THIS GAME! </em>is an exercise in local multiplayer futility. With 4 players closely crowded together at one keyboard fighting for their controls, this simple arcade game can be played in quick, frantic, shouting rounds, usually with multiple people claiming that the previous round was \u201crigged.\"' Get to the center! Don't waste time! Don't run into the bad stuff! GO!</p><p>Enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdb7f467855f3a0c32ef0515526008aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Bujalski"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
