Beat hi-scores with your own wits and reflexes! Draw a lasso by touching points in the screen.

But don't let them touch your lasso before closing it, or else you'll lose time!</p>\n<p>Also, watch out in closing the lasso correctly, crossed lines or lassoes closed without shapes will count as a miss!</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This game has two versions: The free and premium version.
