As you move through the stages your character \n      evolves, and your weapons and shooting abilities change. First you start \n      by throwing weapons by hand, then proceed to using tools where you can \n      have a taste of many different types of projectiles. Cooperative 2 \n      player mode is also available. The controls are simple! Move the \n      character with the Control Stick and the crosshairs with the Wii Remote, \n      and shoot down the targets while dodging enemy attacks. Getting hit by \n      an enemy bullet or touching an enemy close to you will count as a miss. \n      With each miss, you will lose one heart from the bottom indicator of the \n      screen, and losing all hearts will end the game.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45b0d587934d378abef20aed79a06a85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["HUDSON SOFT"], "esrb_rating": null}
