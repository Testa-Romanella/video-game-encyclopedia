It's a simple top-down shooter, where you must survive as long as you can. Touching enemies will insta-kill you, so avoid that.</p>\n\n<p>Use WASD to move, and left-click to shoot.</p>\n\n<p>This was made for studying porpuses, all sprites were made by me in engine, and the sound effects were made in sfxr.</p>\n\n<p>I know it's not GOTY material, but it was fun to work on. I leard a lot about game design basics and I hope to improve this skills in future projects.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to leave feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T08:35:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/189/18950d3ea62de460d415ff83f9b7c821.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marqpaul"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
