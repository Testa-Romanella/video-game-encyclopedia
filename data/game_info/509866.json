This game is based on the theme \"The De-chonking\".</p>\n<p>This is a two-player split-screen game (Player 1 using the WASD keys and Player 2 using the arrow keys), in which the players must compete in maintaining their cat's healthy weight - whoever stays the closest wins!</p>\n<p>This game is made up of two levels - the first an eating game where players can eat food off of a conveyor belt but must make sure they eat the right things so your cat doesn't get sick! Player 1 can use the E key, and Player 2 use the right ctrl key to eat.\u00a0The second level is a rhythm dance game where the player must make sure they hit the right keys at the right time to ensure their weight stays the same - hit too early or too late then you lose too much weight!</p><p>(Note: It's come to our attention that Ctrl+W shuts Chrome, so before playing in the browser please disable this shortcut or please download the executable (for Windows)\u00a0to play!)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Code:</p>\n<p>Ian Barrow (GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/Banananaman91, LinkedIn:\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-barrow/)</p>\n<p>Lizzie Briggs (GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/librasaur, LinkedIn:\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizzie-briggs/)</p>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<p>Leena Jarvenpaa (Insta:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/leenajvpart/)</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>iNTELLiGENTLY BRAiNLESS (SoundCloud:\u00a0https://m.soundcloud.com/intelligently-brainless, Insta: https://www.instagram.com/intelligentlybrainless/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03b/03bd3e9d0a63cd32ec4fa7ad5a39c008.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["librasaur"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
