(I USE OPERA GX AND IT RUNS IT FINE, GOOGLE DOESN'T\u00a0LIKE PEOPLS SUBMISSION OF THIS GAME)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Deltaspace\u00a0</strong>is my first\u00a03D Shooter.</p>\n<p><strong>Modifications:</strong><br/>There are various things I modified within the game such as:</p>\n<p>~ I changed the Title from Insect Space to Deltaspace.<br/></p>\n<p>~ From the Main Menu you can see that I added a working Instruction Section.<br/></p>\n<p>~ The background on the Main Menu Screen is updated and has many little space assets, props, a base, and enemies\u00a0to add flavour to the Main Menu.</p>\n<p>~ When you go into the first level I\u00a0added in a space ship asset as a prop, this is meant to implicate that you came from the ship that landed to pursue your mission.</p>\n<p>~ The area that you can move around in is quite different from the tutorial map shape, there are more obstacles to pass through to get the keys, lots of plants and visually stimulating props to show that the planets was habited.\u00a0I also added in hidden pickups.</p>\n<p>~ Not only did I\u00a0add in the players ship, but if you look around you can find 4 ship wreckages around the map with broken pieces laying about, or stuck/wedged in the cliffs!</p>\n<p>~ If you look about, you can also find little rovers around the map, though they are not running as to not get destroyed by the insects.\u00a0I'm sure they will have them functional after your mission is complete ;)</p>\n<p>~ Around the map you will see big rocks that have blue ores in them! This is what you and your crew are after! There are drilling sites, with huge drills, a giant smelter,\u00a0and ore in\u00a0and boxes full of ore around the map laying in wait to be transported!</p>\n<p>~ There are 2 bases that are full buildings with working doors that all require keycards but they were evacuated because the insects kept infiltrating the base and attacking our poor scientist! Watch out for the spawners!<br/>******YOU CAN DESTROY THE SPAWNERS TOO******</p>\n<p>~ There are 7 mega insects that require 3 shots to kill! Yikes</p>\n<p>~ I implemented some broken outer walls to show some damage from the insects!</p>\n<p>~ I also created a Cactus Variation for a Tall Cactus as I felt there wasn't much options to choose from\u00a0 and wanted to create a more in depth world!</p>\n<p>~ In the boss level, I added pretty much everything I implemented to the first map so it wasn't so bare, I also doubled the amount of spawners hoping it would be a bit more challenging!</p>\n<p>(I have also attached 12 Screenshots!)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></em>Goal: Find All the Keycards to Advance through the locked doors and gates to get to the portal!
