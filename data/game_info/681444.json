Poop crystals need to be removed. They turn dead to poop. Fortunately healing mushrooms grow out of poop.<br/><br/>You will be sent in a ghost form. Enemies can not see or attack you. Scout the area with help of a little fairy to plan your attack. Guide your units to enemies and then send your Dwarf to remove crystals. Use crystal shards to attack enemies. They will come looking for you. Use shards to take them out one by one. Use the terrain to your advantage but watch out for areas, that have no exit. Enjoy 20 various units with melee, ranged and area attacks.<br/><br/>Once you reach the walled city in the final level, you still can keep on playing and improving forever on two leader boards:<br/>- One leader board is for total team health after you completed the levels.<br/>- Another leader board is for time needed to complete levels.<br/><br/>What are you waiting for?
