Help Baxter the blue bat flap through as many stalks of mint as you can! Be careful though, he'll pass out if you hit any of the mint and it's not as easy as you may think \u2014 the farther you get, the faster Baxter goes, so try to keep up and don't lose focus for a second! With a little luck (and a lot of skill), see if you can topple the scores and keep setting the bar higher! Challenge your friends on the leaderboard and see who will be crowned king!</p>\n<p>Don't want to download from itch?\u00a0Download directly from the Google Play Store.</p>\n<p>**** REQUIRES GOOGLE PLAY GAMES LOGIN ****</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03e/03e742b1e3f4903d9e24240449fd8cbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas Turner Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
