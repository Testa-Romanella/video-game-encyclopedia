A level is cleared once you reach the goal portal. As you progress new mechanics are introduced: bouncers, doors, buttons, switches, stoppers, pushers and teleports. The level design combines cute graphics with very challenging puzzles.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNote: Only Windows version is available right now, Mac and hopefully Linux will be added soon.\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Full support for Xbox gamepads and compatible. (No gamepad support in level editor.)</li>\n<li>72 unique handcrafted levels. Early levels introduce the basic mechanics, but soon the game becomes challenging and toward the end it's brutally hard.</li>\n<li>A world map where you navigate 8 different areas.</li>\n<li>Star rating for each level adds replay value, the completionist can go back and try to beat levels in as few moves as possible.</li>\n<li>Soundtrack features 20 different music tracks.</li>\n<li>A level editor is included so you can make your own levels and share with others, or play what others make. (no in-game sharing, you need to share the files yourself)</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tThe game was created by me, Petter Bergmar. I developed the game on my own in my spare time, starting early 2014 and kept working on and off until it was done in late 2016.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ac/3ac5649dca903da31aa5be2b423b3306.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petter Bergmar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
