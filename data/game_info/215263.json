I started from the idea of a maze with no exit and then tried to find interesting other mechanics that still give an interest to explore the maze and a way to \"get out\" from the maze without going through an exit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0use the arrows to move /choose an option in the journal mode</li><li>use SPACE to interact\u00a0/select an option in the journal mode</li><li>use ESC to quit</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Explore the maze and interact with what you find. When you are blocked, you can interact with your dream journal to unblock the situation. You can erase the last sentences to go back in the past. As the maze is randomly generated, it can help you to find an other way.\u00a0Once you find some words, you can also use them to rewrite and\u00a0\u00a0modify your past action or the description of the\u00a0maze. The 'rewrite' option will be proposed when you try to erase a sentence that contains a part that an be rewrite. So you need to erase all the sentences after the part you want to rewrite before rewriting it.\u00a0As the maze is randomly generated and the words that you have found are conserved, you can freely erase everything to restart from the beginning without loosing progression.</p>\n<p><strong>This game was made using:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Music :\u00a0http://www.beepbox.co/</li><li>\u00a0Sound : Bfxr</li><li>\u00a0Programming : Java + Processing</li><li>\u00a0Graphics : photoshop +\u00a0https://www.piskelapp.com/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4cda8174ee3ac0f0acc291b79837f78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["edmond00"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
