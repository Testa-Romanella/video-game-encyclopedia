Turning retro classic Asteroids into a metroidvania-lite style.<br/><br/><strong>[The world]</strong> Handcrafted with love by sci-fi enthusiasts. A ruined factory with many secrets and unknown technologies. Sometimes exploration will be the key to survival.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>[Story]</strong> This is not really a story-oriented game, but with some investigation, you may stumble upon some information about the factory, the enemies, and ofc. about Bibz. This little maintenance carebot is the protagonist of the game.<br/><br/><strong>[Campaign]</strong> The story mode has got content that should take an average player 6-8 hours to play through, and it also contains many secrets, caters to multiple different playstyles, and includes a number of different paths to take, to keep the game interesting through multiple replays. You will fight against groups of different enemy types, but you have to manage your energy level and the gravity which make your journey harder than you'd think.<br/><br/>The main task of this little bot is to keep things running and maintain what's left of the damaged system it's responsible for. The maintenance work is trivial on an average day - however that particular day when the main computer wakes us from our hibernation is anything but average. Its request is not only to resume our duties but also to find and eradicate the hostiles of unknown origin from the factory.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T02:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/289/2896fb8cecc9a6a59de4071498c506ed.jpg", "website": "https://carebotzgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glasscannon Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Glasscannon Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
