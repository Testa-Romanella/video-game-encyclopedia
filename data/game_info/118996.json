Parts can be bought or found on enemies then welded to the hull of your ship, and can range from thrusters to cannons to solar panels.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0It's in its early stages and I'd love to hear anyone's first impressions. If people seem interested I'll continue adding more parts, enemies, areas and overall polish. So if you enjoy the game or find any bugs feel free to leave a comment or email me at <strong>pwcbrock@gmail.com</strong>\u00a0all criticism welcome.\u00a0Thanks for checking it out!</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b22c2f3012563174e3455d9219cc3f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PWCB"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
