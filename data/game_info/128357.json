Doing so requires jumping and moving around to avoid boxes flying at you. The game switches into hardmode and hardermode as time goes on, so boxes start coming faster and stronger. Collecting gold nuggets gives you 10 extra points.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made as a small summer project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43e/43e1f5ce63d479f31e7687d3e5d53054.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bragma"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
