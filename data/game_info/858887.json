{"id": 858887, "slug": "power-plants-demo", "name": "Power Plants [Demo]", "name_original": "Power Plants [Demo]", "description": "<p>This game is incomplete, and lacks features needed for story progression, so Save Slot 1 contains a seed for each kind of plant. You can watch them grow, and help them generate the most power possible. In the future there will be a shop for buying new seeds and upgrades, Battles to take down the fossil fuels, and other quality of life improvements. If you'd like to see this game in its complete form, let me know so that I know it's worth the effort.<br/><br/>Note: There is a small glitch with some text in the game causing it to be blurry. This was unintended, and technically causes extra colors to exist on screen, but the game itself was\u00a0 designed strictly with only 4 colors. Please ignore this small issue as it doesn't change anything. Also if there is no highlighted menu button, you might need to click one to regain normal gameboy control.<br/><br/>#HotMess<br/><br/>Controls:</p>\n<p>D-Pad = WASD or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>A button = N</p>\n<p>Start = Enter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T14:46:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d1/3d13d303e0129e270c05fb5e4d5622cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Neon Pie Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
