Play as a mama cat, collect balls of string, get to your kittens to beat the level. There are portals (purple) and jump pads, advanced controls, wall-jumping, stuff you'd expect from a cat platformer game. There's a GUI, a high score tracker, and the controls are explained in the main menu. The only issue I can think of is that there's weird collision with the collectibles, otherwise it plays pretty well.\u00a0Enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f62/f629c173afb08d96a1d3d9bfcd430c54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maghook"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
