It\u2019s already dark, but this is the first chance you\u2019ve gotten today to sit down and work on your hobby. You\u2019re faced with the same conundrum as always during nights like this: should you stay up and do what you love, or get a decent night\u2019s sleep for another busy day tomorrow? Do your best to get quick inspiration, keep yourself awake, and avoid complete burnout in this small interactive narrative about trying to make time for yourself.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my first experiment in the Twine engine, and it\u2019s been quite the experience! Trying to implement images and sound into the game was a much bigger struggle than expected, so I apologize if this particular entry is even more on the janky feeling side than usual. The music was of particular challenge, to the extent that your experience may even be better with the game muted to be honest. Also, the game doesn't run properly on some browsers, Firefox specifically to my knowledge (it's still playable on all browsers, but in my testing Chrome and Safari worked best).\u00a0I believe this is an issue specific to the version of Twine I used, so I apologize for that as well. Regardless of all that though, I still hope you enjoy! </p>\n<p>As always, please feel free to leave a comment with any thoughts or recommendations!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:06:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f24/f24ced500c3744322af1f3960e96578c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
