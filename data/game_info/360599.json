You assume the role of a warlock venturing into caves in order to collect blood by slaying beasts.</p>\n<p>Beware though: Unlike other games of this genre, you don't have separate resources like health and mana. In <em>Essence of Agony</em>, your only resource is the Essence, which is drained both by getting hit or casting spells. Refill your Essence by striking foes and absorbing their remains.</p>\r\nHow to control?\r\n<p>Use the mouse cursor to aim.</p>\r\n\r\n  InputAction\r\n  \r\n    WMove up\r\n    AMove left\r\n    SMove down\r\n    DMove Right\r\n    LMB (hold)Melee attack (Charge a ranged attack, when fully charged release to shoot)\r\n    RMB (hold)Parry (Channel a shield and block damage)\r\n    RMB (hold) + LMBHarvest corpses while channeling shield\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat's so special?\r\n<p>In <em>Essence of Agony</em> you have <strong>only one resource - Essence</strong>, which is your health, your stamina, your ammunition, your experience and your money all at once.</p>\n<p>Attacking, casting, getting hit and buying consume your essence. Hitting or killing enemies or harvesting corpses refill your essence.</p>\r\nDev's notes\r\n<p>This game the GMTK Game Jam 2019 entry of Hannes Thalheim and Marcel Winter.</p>\n<p>The game was made in Game Maker Studio 2 and finished to this extend in less then 48h. Everything you will experience was made entirely by us during the jam including level design, visuals, music and sound effects.</p>\n<p>Initially, we also planned to have Essence as a means to buy power ups and to finish the game by sacrificing a certain amount to your patron diety, but the scope grew to big for us two to handle in this timeframe. Therefore, the game can now be finished by completing all ten dungeon rooms (including three tutorial levels).</p>\n<p>We've had a lot of fun creating this game and we hope you have a good time playing it. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T18:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d3/3d3cc1369b899fd2edc633c5ab9f74b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["imhanner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
