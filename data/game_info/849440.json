In this jam, we were tasked to create a game in 48 hours using Kenney assets (sprites, models, etc.).

Every coin and gem you gather grows your field of view, while gems also enhance your movement.</p>\n<p>This is the first jam I have entered, so I hope you enjoy! Above all, I would love feedback on how I can improve.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T04:42:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa096b9342ebe28215649a2ad1aeacf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dizzi68"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
