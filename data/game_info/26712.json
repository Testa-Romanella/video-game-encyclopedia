Chimaki is a tiny creature with an \n      insatiable lust for life. Something of a recluse, he ventures out of his \n      hermitage on occasion to seek the truth. What goes on behind that \n      implacable face is a mystery \u2013 perhaps even to Chimaki himself. Make use \n      of Chimaki\u2019s run, jump and towel attacks to collect apples, successfully \n      bypass the legions bent on his destruction and reach the hot spring \n      located at the end of each stage. Chimaki is a lover, not a fighter. As \n      such, a mere two hits will cause him to expire.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb318eaa50807454e572333ad81ba164.jpg", "website": "http://www.aksysgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 16, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Aksys Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
