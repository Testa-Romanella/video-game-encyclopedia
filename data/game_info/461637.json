{"id": 461637, "slug": "box-factory", "name": "Box Factory", "name_original": "Box Factory", "description": "Box Factory is an isometric puzzle game where the player needs to push boxes on the right tiles to complete the levels. To move a box to the right place involves logical thinking. This game is of course inspired by Sokoban but with a couple of new game mechanics. The player can use stairs to reach higher places and push boxes down to a lower tile even stack the boxes on top of each other. Other levels include teleports that transports a box to a different place.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you make a mistake you can undo your steps by clicking the undo button. There is also a button that rotates the camera if you need to navigate from a different angle because the game is 3D. Use WASD or the arrow keys or the left stick on the gamepad or use onscreen buttons to move around the map.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T17:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdc8c3af3b1608e329a9a60807180bac.jpg", "website": "http://www.nannings.nz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Tuwi Michael Nannings", "Nannings"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["NanningsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
