Players roll a die, move their player token, and then place down a pattern on the 3x3 grid to influence the overall benefits of each tile. Is your player standing on a positive tile? That's a good day. Is your player standing on a negative tile? That's not such a good day. Quick to pick up, takes some time to master. A perfect game to teach the critical thinking. Also includes a head-to-head mode where you can challenge a friend in pass-and-play fun times.</p>\n<p>Originally designed as a board game, I decided to digitize for my own sanity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/791/791e6821603c2ce8ed5e50f3c72f804c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alexander Shen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
