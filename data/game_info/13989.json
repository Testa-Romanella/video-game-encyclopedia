It has been twenty years since the Rending - an event that left most of the world's population dead, their souls severed from their bodies. These souls linger, and survive as ghosts.<br/><br/><br/>The surviving humans have done their best to rebuild society, but the world is a very different place. Ghosts roam the land, wild and unpredictable. Their magical abilities make them extremely dangerous to anyone who gets on their bad side. <br/><br/>There are rumours, however, of humans developing supernatural abilities. Apparently there are people possessing the same magical abilities as the ghosts, and even people able to control the ghosts themselves. Ghostlords tells the stories of these individuals and the world they live in.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc627c3f682726d876256d3f7dce60c6.jpg", "website": "http://ghostlords.helixfox.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 42, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["HelixFox Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HelixFox Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
