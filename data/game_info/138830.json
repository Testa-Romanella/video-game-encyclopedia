Beware: bad programmer art!</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn't have nearly enough time to polish and improve on this game because of work-related stuff, but I really wanted to try at least SOMETHING for Ludum Dare, since I never participated in a game jam before.</p><p>The more important part, however, is that I learned quite a lot about some of the tools I used (such as DOTween, an AMAZING Unity tweener). I'm definitely going to try something better next time :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca1/ca1fa1fcba42f5c5ffe84821d4e3e82b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["edmilson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
