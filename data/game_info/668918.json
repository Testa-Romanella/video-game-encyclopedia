This jam had a theme and a requirement, the theme was ON THE EDGE, and the requirement was BOSS. For my game you play as the big BOSS, Tyrannosaurus Rex and you battle against a pack of Velociraptors, all the while you are ON THE EDGE of extinction. At any minute a meteor can crash and kill your entire species, and you can't do anything about it except fighting against your own kind. Hope you will like it :)</p>\n<p>!!!PLEASE ENTER ON FULLSCREEN MODE BY PRESSING THE BOTTOM LEFT BUTTON!!!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>MOVE - ARROW KEYS</p>\n<p>BITE - Hold Z</p>\n<p>FIRE - Hold X</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:33:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ec/0ece92f5cd8b831be3bfa9a060b7921c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlexN5II0"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
