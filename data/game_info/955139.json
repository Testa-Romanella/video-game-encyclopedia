Escape the prison and save your little village from the beast that begun prowling the forests, all the while fighting the Hunters who, for some reason, think you're the one to blame...</p>\n<p>The game is pretty short and the screenshots hide the UI for spoiler reasons :D<br/></p>\n<p>Had a lot of fun with this one. Each year I build upon the same \"base gridder engine\" I've built in Unity and each year I add more things to it and fix more things and try to bend it in different ways. Eventually, I'll probably have a decent dungeon crawler base, hah, but that moment is far away since I only work on it during these jams.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Cara's Voiceover:\u00a0kristina_vo</p>\n<p>Most of assets: Synty Studios and Meshtint</p>\n<p>Sounds: Freesound.org</p>\n<p>Music: Ibuproaudio, John Leonard French<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASDQE or Numpad to move</p>\n<p>You can click on mobs to attack them or right click to use your special ability.
