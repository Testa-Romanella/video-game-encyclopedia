A project I made for my game project at Goldsmiths in 2021. This is an attempt at a hybrid of a platformer and a visual novel. The platforming segments are how you choose what path you go down of which, there are 3. Neutral, Good, and Bad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently, this is a demo build so I would advise you to try to stick to one path for the most cohesive experience of the story segments. There is a guide contained within if you are struggling to figure out certain aspects of the game.</p>\n<p>Though, I believe the tutorial scene should be sufficient. Example Cutscene is not necessary for regular players to click on. It is purely for my university professors to see. There is nothing wrong with clicking it other than it's most uninteresting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T21:56:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa7/aa75acde55797cf3e1d29d62b0d9fc41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Waf"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
