The game is containing development as Ruga at https://beep2bleep.itch.io/ruga</p><p>Red and Blue is a Room Scale VR Bullet Hell. You have two ships one red one blue, the blue ship can kill blue enemies and be killed by red enemies and bullets. The red ship can kill red enemies and be killed by blue enemies and bullets.</p><p>Grab one ship with each hand and dodge, shoot, and stay alive. The game is over if either ship is contacted by the opposite color.</p><p>This was build for the HTC Vive but will likely work for the Rift although it might be hard to play on the Rift unless you have a large area. If you get it working on the Rift please send me a video.</p><p>The vast majority of the development was streamed at youtube.com/c/beep2bleep. There probably only were about 10 minutes not streamed. This was made in 48 hours for LDJam 37.</p><p>Gameplay Video: </p><p>Streamed (Looked 12/9/16-12/11/16 or for things listed at #LDJAM 37): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdn3LiIwSbir5bb07JmNA9QgaQVG9AJXc<br/></p><p>LD Link: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=p...</p><p>Source Code: https://bitbucket.org/stick100/ldjam37</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d8/8d8a6f5a42891bc99e93f10e000f7bfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beep2Bleep"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
