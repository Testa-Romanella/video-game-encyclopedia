{"id": 669175, "slug": "the-edge-of-time", "name": "The Edge of Time", "name_original": "The Edge of Time", "description": "<p>The Edge of Time is a platformer game made for the VimJam 2. The theme was \"On the Edge\" and the limitation was \"Boss\". Our team decided to incorporate these aspects by creating a game where you are quite literally, on the edge of time.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Timekeeper has taken the world into his hands. On his tower, is his slow-rolling clock of death. When this clock falls off the tower, the game ends. You have 3 lives and 1:30 to make your way through 9 levels of the Timekeeper's tower and defeat him. Good luck.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>A &amp; D or arrow keys for horizontal movement</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Right click on the left or right of the screen to dash</li><li>Left click on the left or right of the screen to swing sword</li><li>R to restart level</li><li>H to toggle hints</li><li>E + W/S to climb ropes</li></ul>\r\nStuff you might like to know:\r\n<p>\u00a0 This guy is a flyer. They can harm you when they get too close. Don't panic though, just swing your sword at them and they should be a pretty easy kill.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the game, you'll come across various clock collectables like this one. They add 15 seconds to the timer, so make sure to pick them up when possible.</p>\n<p>This is the Timekeeper. It is up to you to figure out how to defeat him. No tips here!</p>\r\nHow to give feedback:\r\n<ul><li>Try to avoid repeating anything people have already said.</li><li>Don't ask me to play your game without giving feedback on mine first.</li><li>Rate honestly.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>All assets excluding audio were created by William Herring and Jeremy Liew during the jam period.</p>\r\n\r\nContains music \u00a92021 Joshua McLean (https://joshua-mclean.itch.io) Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:40:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c65e9a7cb071b48e0a56f78fd1f0baed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Brainiac Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
