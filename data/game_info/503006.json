Unfortunately it is impossible to achive this by just controlling one robot at a time. Therefore, after you controlled one robot, you travel back in time to control the next one! You have to remember your moves with the previous robots, so you don't collide with them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0577abcedf1d9d27e9ea81f13ad43c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TriceratopsJJJ"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
