Be aware, though, that your enemies level up with you\u2014as you amass XP for a high score, you also make the game that much more challenging for yourself.CURRENT FEATURES<ul><li>15-minute VR gaming sessions \u2014 a brief, intense VR exploration and combat experience!<br/></li><li>Kinetic reloading mechanics \u2014 to reload you handgun, you need to eject the spent mag/drum (press Menu on your dominant hand), grab a replacement from your ammo pouch (with your off hand), and slot it into the weapon before you can fire<br/></li><li>Trackpad walking \u2014 for more a immersive experience!<br/></li><li>Keep your holosword handy...for close encounters \u2014 Out of ammo? Carve a path through the enemy until you can find more!<br/></li><li>RPG-lite, rogue-like character advancement (collect XP to advance your Level, which in turn increases things like your health and damage stats)<br/></li><li>PERMADEATH! \u2014 you have 15 minutes; no checkpoints; no saves; you die, you start over<br/></li><li>Rogue-like \"dungeon\" \u2014 levels are selected at random from a large pool; we will be expanding the pool of levels over time too, until players should rarely ever see the same level<br/></li><li>All enemy spawn locations are random<br/></li><li>Enemies level with you and the game increases in difficulty as you progress deeper into the spacestation<br/></li><li>No two plays through will be the same \u2014 endless replayability!<br/></li><li>Old-school difficulty \u2014 surviving to reach the escape point should provide a profound sense of accomplishment</li></ul>WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON CURRENTLY<ul><li>We're adding a new Marathon game mode that allows for saving at the start of a new Floor, but still features Permadeath (to maintain that Rogue-like feel)<br/></li><li>We're adding the next set of environment art assets (models and textures) and building a new set of levels based on these new assets.<br/></li><li>We\u2019re experimenting with modifying the player shooting model to allow for critical hits (e.g. on head-shots).<br/></li><li>We\u2019re starting to replace the placeholder audio files with Final audio assets. There are no Final audio assets in the current build, so there's a lot of work to be done.<br/></li><li>We want to add another melee-type enemy unit<br/></li><li>We're experimenting with adding VR hands and proper left- and right-handedness support</li></ul><br/>The Early Access release of VR0GU3 is intended to help us gather community feedback on all aspects of the game. We invite our players to share their feedback in our Steam forums where all may contribute freely to the discussion. Jump in and contribute your ideas today!REGARDING SIMULATOR SICKNESSVR0GU3 utilizes a touchpad walking-style of movement (e.g. ONWARD). This method of VR locomotion can bring on simulator sickness if you are sensitive to it. If so, the good news is that you can harden yourself to simulator sickness in the same way sailors get their sea-legs\u2014but hardening to simulator sickness can take a while and is not a particularly nice experience. For this reason, we do not recommend that players who are sensitive to simulator sickness buy our game \u2014 we don't think those players will enjoy it very much.<br/><br/>Depending on community reaction, we may introduce other locomotion systems, like teleportation, at a later date, but we have no plans to implement these at this time given the potential impact on the game's pacing and challenge \u2014 it would be difficult if not impossible to ensure a level playing field for the Leaderboards.<br/><br/>Having said that, we will be constantly engaging with our player community, and specifically keeping a eye on how players react to touchpad walking \u2014 that's pretty much what Early Access is all about.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13fd7c564678ff0f94152ac4ab884330.jpg", "website": "http://www.bigdumbfungames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big Dumb Fun Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Dumb Fun Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
