They could also restrict access to their room by making it VIP \ud83d\udc51 or private \ud83d\udd12.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are only so many hours in a month, so I decided to make it a single-player puzzle-adventure game with predefined number of rooms and NPCs, instead of other real players, hanging around, dancing, and having fun! (yes, robots can have fun too! \ud83e\uddbf \ud83e\uddbf \ud83e\udd16) <br/></p><p>Players can also customize their avatar skin and dance moves! \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udd7a<br/></p>\r\nWeb Monetization\r\n  \r\n<p>There are two ways Web Monetization is utilized within WM Party House:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>If players like the vibe of the room, the company, music, its interactive content, or simply are having a lot of fun, they can decide to enable Web Monetization and support room\u2019s creator.</li></ul><ul><li>For VIP rooms, it is mandatory to enable Web Monetization to be able to join.\r\n  </li></ul>\r\nTheme\r\n  \r\n<p>There is more than one mechanic in the game which corresponds to the theme. In the spirit of the theme itself, I will not reveal what they are, but rather let you discover yourself. \ud83d\ude4a\r\n  </p>\n<p>I would love to hear your feedback in the comments, related to the overall game, as well related to the secret mechanics and solutions to the puzzles, but please be considerate and don\u2019t spoil the secrets to the others.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This was fun, good luck everyone!<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Credits: Inspired by DJ3D; Assets: Kenney Characters, Mixamo Animations, Cube Room, WSG12-1, Fire Tunnel, dj area, RTJ4 Hands<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T09:09:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b85/b851eac2bc7816ed20e5d09d7ab1cc6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prune Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
