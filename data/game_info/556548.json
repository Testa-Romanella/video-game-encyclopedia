Enemies killed drop XP, which can be moused over to increase a point multiplier for future kills.</p>\n<p><strong>Classic:</strong><br/>The original game, ported as-is - even using the original music! Which probably isn't a good idea, given that it's not public domain. No multipliers, no frills - just destroy enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Mouse: Aim<br/>Left Click: Fire<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Things that Do Not Work\u2122\ufe0f:</strong><br/>\u00a0-High scores<br/>\u00a0-Any sort of settings menu whatsoever<br/>\u00a0-Probably some other crap I'm forgetting</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>sendhelpidfk - programming, music for menu and arcade<br/>crobatchaser23 (scratch account no longer exists) - original game</p>\n<p><strong>Music Used:<br/></strong>Vexento - Masked Heroes (Classic Loop)<br/>minecraftuniverse - Eclipse (Classic Game Over)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:09:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c1f1dc7f9e569e9d7968967508d82a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sendhelpidfk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
