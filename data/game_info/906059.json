Gather it all and bring it back to the Mother Ship. But be careful, you might have to blast some rogue hexagons along the way.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>Move/Speed - Arrow Keys or WASD<br/>Shoot - Space button<br/><br/><strong>Objective:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The objective is to collect as much wheat as possible from the planets. Once it's ready to harvest, just fly around a planet to collect, then head back to the Mother Ship (flying saucer) to deposit your harvest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beware of enemies, the red hexagons will kill you if you're not careful. Luckily your ship comes equipped with a blaster. Blast the hexagons and your cargo capacity will increase.<br/><br/><strong>Tips:</strong><br/>- Fly backwards in order to take out enemies more easily</p>\n<p>- Kill enemies to increase your cargo capacity</p>\n<p>- Sometimes you don't want to go at full speed</p>\n<p>- If you get lost, continue in one direction and you'll eventually be brought to the other side of the map. (I plan on adding some sort of compass pointing to the Mother Ship at some point)<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f0329d07efa135a56edb562ee9222524.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cody Mace"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
