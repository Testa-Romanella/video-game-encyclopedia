Invent your way through the woods, identify your friends and evade from the undead to make it to the root of all evil. Or, to the cleansing? <br/>The Redemption of the Phantom Village is a VR game made by the Killmobil team for the PROCJAM 2020, between December 4 to 14. Procedurally generated techniques for videogames development, was an idea stuck in our minds for long. Here, we developed procedural tools to generate the world. We extrapolated information from noise maps to create and tie together the islands, to fill the world with assets and lights and to bridge the lands on players' will.</p>\n<p>We loved it, we will keep experimenting.
