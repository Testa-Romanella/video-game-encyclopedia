Here it is. It features pixel art that I made myself and has you exploring a small world to collect items and talk to statues. The game runs at 8 fps by default but you can speed it up by changing the value of the speedMultiplier variable in the scripts.js file.\u00a0Enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T07:40:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03f/03f74c1ba2819241e0ff8019df5551c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DebugOrc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
