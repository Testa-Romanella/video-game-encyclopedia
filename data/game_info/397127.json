He grabs some milk and eggs and prepares to head home after a long day. As he exits the store, a hooligan shoulder checks him as he is running away from cops. As Gordio stumbles his milk and eggs go flying. None of the eggs survive, and his milk is spilt all over the street. He falls to his knees, holding back tears. He told himself he would never cry over spilt milk again. He whips his head to where the hooligan ran off to swearing revenge upon this little, beady-eyed man that dared to waste food. He leaps to his feet and sees the hooligan disappear down a manhole. Gordio runs and jumps into the hole, blind with rage, but miscalculates how far down it goes. As he falls the light fades from above and his vision fades to black. When he comes to, he finds himself locked away in a dungeon guarded by man-sized rats. As he explores the environment, he comes to realize that the rats are not man-sized: it is he who is a rat-sized man. He must drink milk to return to his normal size and defeat the hooligan.</p>\n<p>The game is wacky and fun, largely inspired by the anime JoJo's Bizarre Adventure! We hope you enjoy the result of our semester long effort!</p>\n<p>- Team Bjork:</p>\n<p>Colette Nadon - Background Artist</p>\n<p>Bofeng Chen - Main Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Justine Bendico - Everything Else</p>\n<p>Ian Seng Wok - Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Abay Rysbek - Character Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:42:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/067/06735d34ca5b72792aad3eef56aa42c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mintiani"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
