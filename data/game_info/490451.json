Some are more difficult than others. Obstacles are now present in the game - don't disappoint your leaders by getting cured!<br/>\r\n- Arcade-ish sound effects added.<br/>\r\n- Play area and window size have been made bigger, allowing for more possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMore arenas/stages will likely be added over time or in the future as extra additional content.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis was inspired by \"SnakeBite\", my first video game ever as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is intended to be a \"play as the villains\" type of thing.
