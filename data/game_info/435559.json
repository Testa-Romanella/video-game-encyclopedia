It consists of 53 short, numbered musical phrases, lasting from half a beat to 32 beats; each phrase may be repeated an arbitrary number of times. Each musician has control over which phrase they play: players are encouraged to play the phrases starting at different times, even if they are playing the same phrase.</p>\n<p>In C is often cited as the first minimalist composition.\r\n<br/>This is not a game, but a musical experience/experiment.\r\n<br/>The composition takes between 30-45 minuts.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>You are encouraged to sit and listen. The composition is in constant change and the position and direction you are taking inside the game is influencing your experience of the procedural generated soundscape.<br/>Sometimes it might not be to your liking, but give it a couple of minuts and maybe some new and interesting patterns and melodies will arise from the chaos.<br/></p>\n<p>Made by: <br/>Jeppe Emil Lindskov\r\n<br/>Mads Vesterager Riddersholm\r\n<br/>Ronny S.
