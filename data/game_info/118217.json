If you love shooting the ever living crap out of everyone and <br/>everything without remorse, we have the game for you! Blow the German <br/>Krauts into smithereens on the battlefield and raise the proud American <br/>flag with the Muricah or Annihilate the Alakbas and Kimchis, it has <br/>never been so fun and fulfilling. Ever, period.<br/>This isn't just a game, this is the most exhilarating, graphic and jaw <br/>dropping game where no one is best, and everyone is just a little less <br/>crap. Join the battlefield in one of two teams, 8 real players in total,<br/> 4 in each team. Maybe your friends can join in too, if they can look <br/>past the GORE.<br/>Pick a bone with the old World War buddies and recreate the Great War on<br/> the battlefield! But remember, President Trump will be on the great <br/>metal war machine and ready to take your attacks all day long! Sure you <br/>can hit the others on the battlefield, but Trump is your main target, <br/>destroying him means business!<br/>Remember to pick up some ammo on the way, so you have a chance against <br/>the President's mechanical doomsday contraption! There's rifles, <br/>landmines, and shotguns! It's most insensitive way to take the 80 year <br/>old revenge, and it is the most satisfying.<br/>If your idiot butt forgot to pick up that ammo on the way, and your <br/>weapon jams up because you forgot to clean it, press the boost button <br/>and spear the propagandists right in the chest, and take, them, down.<br/>Tanks spawn too sometimes, only when Trump breaths heavily on your neck <br/>really hard, that hardcore killing machine takes down hundreds, even <br/>thousands of the foot soldiers and it is ghoulish!<br/>Don't fall into the trap and join any team they throw you in, choose <br/>which team you want to join first, because, free will, and play your <br/>friends over local Wi-Fi or the internet, it's literally a blast, okay. <br/>The most exciting game to play with your friends! If they're too busy <br/>for your game, grab them by the.. Arm and drag them into the battle <br/>arena!<br/>Team death match just got a whole new meaning, have fun with this new <br/>team game, collateral damage is just another way to take down the real <br/>enemy. Get set, get loaded and remember, don't start World War 3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e38/e38855beb40eec561149c4bb63dd9cae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["worldwarparty"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
