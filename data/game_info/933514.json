Hack the world your character is in by placing\u00a0six-sided dice on a square grid, linking them by\u00a0their pips. Use your abilities to influence what die roll you're using, or how the board itself looks.</p>\n<p><em>(Due to several real life circumstances, I'm publishing the video game before the TTRPG is\u00a0finished. I\u00a0realize that a lot of context for the game is written in the PDF, so I apologize ahead of time for the inconveniences this might cause. I'll try to finish it and update this page\u00a0as soon as I\u00a0can. Thank you for your understanding.)</em><br/></p>\r\nThe Setting\r\n<p>Runehack:\u00a0The Asterist place in Runehack, the same world that's already explored in Runehack:\u00a0Fairy Heist and\u00a0Runehack:\u00a0University's Pillars, and multiple articles on my blog. In this game, each player's\u00a0character is a sentient mind scan nicknamed \"ghost\", simulated within the hologram-like city of Everling that hovers above the ocean's floor.\u00a0Asterists are citizens of Everling who are capable of hacking the city itself, as well as\u00a0its other citizens. Take a look at my blog\u00a0if you'd like to learn\u00a0more about Runehack.</p>\r\nInteractive Demo\r\n<p>This page also features an interactive demo of the hacking system utilized in the TTRPG. In it, you will find:</p>\n<ul><li>8 levels, in which you can get used to the core mechanics of the TTRPG, and see some example levels it could feature.</li><li>Solo Hack functionality, as described in the TTRPG.</li><li>An original dynamic soundtrack composed by me with no prior composing experience. It develops with each level,\u00a0and sometimes even on significant progress in a level.</li><li>A small surprise after finishing all eight levels.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Space</strong> to spin the die (puzzle mode), or to roll a die (solo hack mode).</li><li><strong>Left</strong> and\u00a0<strong>Right arrow</strong> keys to swap difficulty (solo hack mode).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T10:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62c/62c19fa6c32b5a2d53eca936d317ba44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Proph"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
