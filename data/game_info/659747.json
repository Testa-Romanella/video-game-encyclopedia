The cold climate hasn't done the place any favors either as the whole floor is covered in ice! Being the scoundrel that you are you figured that this place might house some treasure ripe for the taking. A little danger has never stopped the likes of you.</p>\r\nSummary\r\n<p>Puzzle your way through the rooms of an icy dungeon while using the mysterious power of the dungeon itself to rotate the layout of the room. When rotating only the goal and the player remain in place, be careful not to fall into any pits and make use of dry patches of ground whenever possible.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Action</strong><br/><strong>Keyboard</strong><br/><strong>Controller</strong>MoveArrow Keys<br/>D-PadRotate Left<br/>QL Bumper<br/>Rotate Right<br/>ER Bumper<br/>ResetRY/Triangle<br/>PauseEscStart<br/>Full Screen<br/>FSelect\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Programming: Marcello Haddeman</li><li>Game Design: Pedro Krieckaert</li></ul>\n<p>This game was made for the Kenney Jam 2021 using the Godot engine.</p>\r\nNotes\r\n<ul><li>Quit button on the browser version freezes the game.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T14:20:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb20ef66a8e390bd2f0c368af357011d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Rushkiller"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
