This is my first game that I programmed completely by myself. I taught myself how to program it all, and didn't use any tutorials to create the actual game mechanics. I\u00a0did it from scratch!\u00a0The music and enemies and weapon models aren't mine, but the how the game runs?\u00a0That's all me. So that includes the weapon animations, the enemy AI, the UI, etc. Anyways, it's nowhere near great, but it's something. I hope you get a little bit of fun out of it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56e/56e2863b54cc6379547579d1ab1dc887.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SydTheCoderKid"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
