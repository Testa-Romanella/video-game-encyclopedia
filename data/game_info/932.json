Thank you.<br/><br/>==========<br/><br/>Android Rundown review: 8.5/10<br/>&amp;quot;Wrapping up, I can\u2019t really think of significant flaws in Dungeon Nightmares. Maybe the graphics could be a bit better and the dungeon rooms could have more variety with more objects of interest, and the story could be richer, but really, it\u2019s fine the way it is. I want to say that it\u2019s a great \u201cscreamer\u201d, but I really think that it would be a bit insulting, because Dungeon Nightmares is a great horror game.&amp;quot;<br/>http://www.androidrundown.com/app-rundown/dungeon-nightmares-review/<br/><br/>==========<br/>148Apps review: 4/5<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Dungeon Nightmares is truly one of the most immersive and scariest experiences on iOS for some time.&amp;quot; <br/>http://www.148apps.com/reviews/dungeon-nightmares-review/<br/><br/>==========<br/><br/>AppDaily.ru review: 4/5<br/><br/>(translated)<br/>&amp;quot;So, if you are alien horror, if you do not check off their nerves on the strength, if you are not afraid Screamer and want to get a new dose of adrenaline - this game is for you.
