Begin by entering the Lobby and navigating the impossibly small arcade. The first room contains 3 arcade cabinets with variations on the coin dropper theme.</p>\n<p>Directly behind the machines is a vendor area, just like the arcade! Exchange prizes earned from playing for tickets, or cash in tickets and buy it all.</p>\n<p>Through the doorway lies the Trophy Room where prizes you\u2019ve earned or bought will slowly fill up display cases for you to enjoy. Check back often to see your progress.</p>\n<p>There is no end goal, no real-world riches to to be had, so enjoy this simple little game for what it is. Yes I know the start screen is atrocious.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df1/df10efb65d4db0742010da9b929f2b89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JayP140"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
