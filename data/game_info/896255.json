Nevertheless, we plowed forward and worked intensely in order to deliver our best vision of the game. By the end, we were appreciative of everyone's efforts and were glad we reached a point we felt we had a game that felt fun and made people communicate, try again, and laugh.</p>\n\n<p>Team 12:</p>\n<p><strong>Designers</strong><br/>Jonathan Berk\u00e1n<br/>Marcos Correa<br/>Simon H\u00e5kansson<br/>Ella Lopez<br/><br/><strong>Artists<br/></strong>Emil Brax<br/>Xander Jemide<br/>Ka Sonn Tang<br/><br/><strong>Programmers</strong><br/>Einar Hallik<br/>William Strand Paurell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T20:06:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e5/3e5adcc1b21fd0d7b5a83a0f06a48fb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
