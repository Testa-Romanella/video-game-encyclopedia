The boy had a stepsister that was his age but he accidentally killed her 10 years ago while he was portraying another person. The split personality drove Kyle to hurt others and himself. Seven years later, the boy's split personality has not gotten any better and he has managed to fabricate many other characters. In this chapter of his life, we get to learn how Kyle meets a girl that has similar traits as his sister did, and tries to protect her from any harm that might come her way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCore Features<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Compelling Story <br/>\r\n   (Continue the story, and find out what happens next in this continuation of Kyle's life)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Horrifying Situations<br/>\r\n  (Horrifying bosses and enemies that the player will encounter throughout the game and will test the player's abilities to survive)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Inventory and Objective System<br/>\r\n  (A system that shows current objectives as well as holds player inventory)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Immersive World <br/>\r\n  (Immersive sounds and great environments that set the mood and atmosphere)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Achievements   (Not in Demo)<br/>\r\n  (Different achievements that will be available for the players to unlock)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Dialog System / Cinematics<br/>\r\n  (This story is mostly told through cinematic videos and dialog, no bad voice actors here!)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T02:05:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99fb21af60a9a5e58fcdb54665a460c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yasmany Roman", "Miguel Roman"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sijawa Production"], "esrb_rating": null}
