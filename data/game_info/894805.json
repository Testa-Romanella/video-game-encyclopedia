It grew largely\u00a0out of an interest in experimenting with ways to render the 3D view for these sorts of dungeon crawlers; it turned out that perspective transforms in CSS worked well enough so that's what you're seeing here.</p>\n<p>You can navigate using the W, Q, and E keys -- W to move forward, Q and E to turn left and right.</p><p>You can reload to get a new dungeon to explore. The dungeons are generated with either Prim's algorithm or a recursive backtracking algorithm (picked at random), then some subset of dead ends are converted to loops (exactly how many dead ends are converted is also random).<br/></p>\n<p>The source code for this is available too, over on GitHub: https://github.com/spinfoam-games/CDungeon<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T09:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23f/23f3e64adc83a6761a2809cbe6fdf25b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spinfoam Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
