You'll need quick reflexes, clear vision, and a big appetite for fun in this old school arcade free space shooter.<br/><br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>This space games controls are so easy. Just use one finger to move your blade star fighter around the screen. Don't get hit by any of the bullets, and don't fly in to any of the invaders or asteroids. Your space gun shoots automatically. Shoot all the geometry invaders and try to live for as long as you in the infinity wars.<br/><br/>In the beginning you have 100 points of force field shield energy, each hit effects 10 points of damage. No force field and your dead (More force field shield updates coming soon).<br/><br/>Collect as many geometry star 's as you can to unlock extra guns for your blade star fighter. Guns can be unlocked in the shop scene. Just tap on the gun you would like to unlock when you have collected enough geometry star 's.<br/><br/><br/>Have fun pilot :)<br/>The Cobalt Play 8 Bit Team", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/237daff23808975ba3901f6e8ed2520f_CVWOo47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martin Finch"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Martin Finch"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
