Only Mack, a technician \n      from the recycling facility Plant 530, stands in their way as Earth\u2019s \n      last line of defense. Step into Mack\u2019s shoes in this guided first-person \n      shooter as he takes on the invading aliens with only his trusty recycle \n      cannon and a can-do attitude. Blast and vacuum (yes, vacuum) your way to \n      victory, by keeping in mind that every shot counts\u2014because your ammo \n      also doubles as your health, and every enemy you destroy leaves behind \n      Can Energy that you can vacuum up and use as ammo. Uncomplicated \n      controls (including optional Wii Zapper support) give everyone the \n      chance to save the earth, while advanced tactics like consecutive hit \n      combos and the tough Challenge mode give even the best players a run for \n      their money. Are you ready to step up and put a dent in their cans?\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:16", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
