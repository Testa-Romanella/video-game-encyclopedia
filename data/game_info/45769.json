Keep on giving answers that fit the description for more points. Work out the harder answers for bonus multipliers, and avoid the trapped answers that will lose you points and the right to answer if you input an expected falsehood.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour experience is fully customisable... if you want to. Get down to the nitty gritty and create your character to match your likeness perfectly... or just stick a name in and hop into the game! Dive straight into a multiplayer gameshow that will test your knowledge across the board... or choose a specific category like Red, White and Blue Flags of the World and do your best. Tick Tick Pass can do it all!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/542/5421a029931bb95aef26945a05ef21bb.jpg", "website": "http://chequered.ink/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chequered Ink"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chequered Ink"], "esrb_rating": null}
