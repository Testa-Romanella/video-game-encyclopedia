This is just as simple endless runner game. It starts out slow but progressively gets faster and faster. it has red spikes as the Instant kill obstacle and silver coins and gold coins for pickups.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game's a bit\u00a0rough around the edges but i think it turned out pretty ok. it was a fun process and I'm already working on my next game.
