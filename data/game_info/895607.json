I hope you'll like it and hope that all experience I get during this project will help me improve my next ones.<br/><br/>Idk what to say more, let me know how you like this game, what should I do better or what I did well.<br/><br/>GameON!</p>\r\nControls:\r\nKeyboard\r\n<ul><li><strong>WSAD</strong> - Movement</li><li><strong>Space</strong> - Jump</li><li><strong>E </strong>- Interact</li></ul>\r\nGamepad\u00a0(should work)\r\n<ul><li>Left Analog - Movement</li><li><strong>A</strong><em>(XBox)</em> /\u00a0 <strong>X</strong><em>(PS)\u00a0</em>- Jump</li><li><strong>Y</strong><em>(XBox)</em> / <strong>Tringle</strong><em>(PS)</em> - Interact</li></ul>\n<p>All assets are created by me.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to SaikingS for\u00a0substantive assistance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T15:22:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703ba0bd2bf79152ddca151d8be52f6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Figus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
