It's a lot uglier now than before (not that it was very good looking then either) but at least the text looks nice now.</p>\n<p>Oh, you could fuck around with the assets if you wanted to, there's a kind of scripting language thing, although right now it won't give you a pleasant error if you fuck up some of the syntax so you'd need to be careful.</p>\n<p>Now that I'm (almost) up to the same level as the the unity version in terms of functionality I want to work on actually making things potentially look good, so next DD will probably be mostly oriented around that (but maybe content things too?)</p>\n<p>There's probably some bugs I haven't seen, so feel free to email me or give me a (you) with reports of those, or just suggestions in general</p>\n<p>sfdstrandberg@gmail.com<br/>@sfdstrandberg</p><p>CONTROLS:<br/>Click cards to play or buy them.</p>\n<p>You can select different class (what cards you can buy) and adventures (what cards you encounter) from the menu.</p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY:<br/>1) RESOLVE A DUNGEON CARD. This is one of the three at the top<br/>2) PLAY ACTIONS. Playing action cards costs actions (visible in the top left of the screen.) You only have 1 to start with, but can get more from cards. XP cards don't get played.<br/>2) ENEMIES ATTACK.<br/>3) BUY CARDS. You can buy cards from the piles to the left. If you finish buying and any of the piles are empty, it'll be filled up from the source deck thing.<br/>4) CLEANUP - all your remaining cards get discard, and your actions, shields, and experience get reset.<br/>5) DRAW A NEW HAND</p>\n<p>WINNING:<br/>Kill the boss at the end of a dungeon.</p>\n<p>LOSING:<br/>Run out of HP</p>\n<p>SPECIAL RULES:<br/>Shields - when you have these, they get reduced instead of you taking damage. They reset at the end of a turn<br/>Delay - when an enemy has a delay token, they cannot attack this turn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:13:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09c/09c6fa39ae2d2fa2da77698a587ca371.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SSTRANDBERG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
