It\u00b4s not an RPG with a huge inventory or where the player has to sleep to recover his health or mana, actually there's no mana at all!. While the game follows a precise storyline, you are very welcomed to explore its world (castle, village) and content (books).<br/><br/>This game is a Part 1 of what will be a future complete game. It includes the first 3 scenes (the full game will have 9 scenes in total), and gives an introduction to the characters, the settings and the story.
