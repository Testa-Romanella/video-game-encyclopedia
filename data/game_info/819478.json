The player wins if Clint\u2019s HP reaches zero.<br/></p>\n<p>During their turn, the player chooses between one of two dice to attack. The damage of the attack depends on how many dots in the chosen di correspond in their position to the di chosen by Clint. For example, if the player chooses 4 and the opponent chooses 3, this will result in 1 damage.\r\n</p>\n<p>During Clint\u2019s turn, the player chooses between two different dice for their defence and the same mechanic applies. For instance, if the player chooses 4 as defence and the CPU chooses 3 as an attack, this will result in 1 damage (as the middle dot is not present in the 4 di).\r\n</p>\n<p>Tutorial</p>\n<p>The twist is that a higher di doesn't always guarantee a better choice.\r\n</p>\n<p>To select the di, simply click on it, and confirm your action by clicking on the button below.
