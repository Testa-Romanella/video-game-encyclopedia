Gentle floating of the colourful balloons calms me down and I don't have to think about the important things. My mind is empty, I am breathing deeply, the sky is completely blue. This is something that shouldn\u2019t be stressful.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This piece is a failed attempt to capture that moment. In the form of a game, passive balloons become objects that must be directed. Their travel now has a destination. If they fall too low, the game is over. Other objects should be avoided. Time passes and the sky changes. The stress is there again, that soft aimless feeling is now only found in the short breaks between solving tasks.</p>\n<p>Dear player, there are different ways to play this simple game. Hopefully pleasant. I will try to stay out of your way in this process.</p>\n<p><em>animation, coding, concept, visual design- Darko Masnec</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>music- Luka Smeti\u0161ko</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T04:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a99/a9918facf27ee31470473de6672664d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["darkomasnec"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
