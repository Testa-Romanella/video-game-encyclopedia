In the darkness of the void an hummm was heard. With patience you are born in this world, naked barely seeing, walls surrounds you! A door you can distinguish from the limit of your perception.</p>\n<p>Outside the wall of your birth place stands a garden filled with trees and a river, you cannot see really well yet. There\u2019s a bridge to cross the river, but it\u2019s garded by a vile creature, a scrumy green two legged creature. As soon as you approche the creature attacks you, you retaliate and crush the skull of that weakling, blood splatter everywhere, blood, crimson blood, on green grass.</p>\n<p>You continue your way to an other building and try to not step in the void arround you.</p>\n<p>Once inside you are greeted by a young boy.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a8Welcome, Hero, this world is for you and you are for this world.
