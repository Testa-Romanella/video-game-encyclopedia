VERY\u00a0increasingly difficult. Sorry.<br/></p>\n<p>Thrust head first\u00a0into the fantasy world of Archon, you must guide\u00a0Sergeant Pepper through the many challenges ahead. Can you overcome the\u00a0grim Forest of Doom, get across the shifting sands of the Khar\u00e9 Underbelly, over the frost bitten Kestrel Mountains, and deep below through the Grave of Sinners to finally reach the top of Xarmoc Spire and find your way home? Probably not, the game is way too hard. But it's worth a shot!</p>\n<p>To overcome these challenges, you'll need to master rocket jumping. But remember! Rockets cause no harm to the dangerous inhabitants of Archon, so your best bet will be to avoid them at all costs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created in Unreal Engine 4\u00a0over the course of a couple months by a 4 person team enrolled in VUW's MDDN221 Game Design 1 course in 2022. The initial concept was created by me, Ben,\u00a0for the first project of the course. From there the team was formed, and we spent the next couple months from 07/04/22 until 01/06/22 working on the game (in-between working on our others projects).</p>\n<p>The game is very unpolished and flawed in many aspects, particularly in some gameplay / level\u00a0design areas, which is to be expected when creating your first *proper* game (<em>Xarmoc Spire barely counts...</em>). However\u00a0I am still super proud of the work we managed do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The reason it is labeled \"Classic\" is because I plan to work further on the project on my own, polishing up areas that need it, added new features,\u00a0and just generally making the game a bit nicer to play. This version is the game as submitted, without any changes.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Tia Corpe</strong> - Art, Animation</p>\n<p><strong>Matias Ermenyi </strong>- Art, Animation, Level Design Concepts, Sound Effects</p>\n<p><strong>Anfri Hayward</strong> - Lead Programmer, Level Design, Sound Effects, Music</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin Pilbrow</strong> - Game Director,\u00a0Gameplay Design,\u00a0Level Design, Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T08:50:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a12e53e05260de7d34b746ee23fcce54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lemoss"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
