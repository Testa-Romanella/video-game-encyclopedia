The theme was less is more so we decided to make a game in which you have to loose balloons to start falling or gain balloons to slow done your fall and/or make yourself float up. The original idea was that you have to pop your balloons with arrows and if the arrow hit you died. Unfortunately due to time restrictions we weren't able to get the balloon mechanic work. This game was made by a team of 4.\u00a0 Yatharth - lead programmer - 14 years old. Adoring games - artist - 11 years old. Starminer99 - programmer - 14 years old. Kogi/kojl - Musician - 17 years old.
