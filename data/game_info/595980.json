I wanted to add enemies and a key system for the doors but i ran out of time. thanks for playing! I made everything except the fonts and music (songs i used were Ruiz_Pause_Underground and Ruiz_Gonaspace which are included by default in gb studio.)\r\n</p>\n<p>CONTROLS!\r\n</p>\n<p>Up - Up Arrow / W\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Down - Down Arrow / S\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Left - Left Arrow / A\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Right - Right Arrow / D\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>A - Alt / Z / J\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>B - Ctrl / K / X\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Start - Enter\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Select - Shift\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p><p>link to rate on the ld website</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T16:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/005/005cee14a5fc6a4683dbe35fcd49c072.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["programming_sock"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
