There is not much content. Only 2 levels, they are very basic and easy to complete. This was created to help me master the basics of Unity.\u00a0 Small prototype of a floor is lava game with platforms.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to reach to the top of the level and proceed to the next level. The lava will continue to rise as the game goes on, be sure to reach the top before it overwhelms you. Also there is a timer, once the timer hits zero, it is game over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD for movement. Space to jump. There is no escape button. To quit, jump into the lava and get the losing screen and the quit button should appear.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T04:13:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/7634423660143d6c5f5d2fbc373c4d36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Potstickersz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
