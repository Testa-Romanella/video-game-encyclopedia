Perle embodies our thoughts through our history. Become an immaculate being and travel in a unique exploration.</p>\n\n<p>Perle explores dreams by creating levels with a minimum of elements. The story takes the player through a unique adventure, focused on self-satisfaction and fulfillment. Its design features geometrical shapes that suggest a pure world, allowing the imagination to express itself.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Distraught, you embark on an odyssey into the unknown. An esoteric being appears, he knows a lot about you and offers to accompany you. Suspicious, you talk with him, at the end of your discussion, you accept his offer.</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>Take up the challenges in about 30 hand-made pastel-coloured paintings. A moving journey carried by a heartwarming story. Each movement is simple, accessible, to allow everyone to live a pleasant moment. The details are pure lightness. Ideal for a rewarding experience.</p>\n<p>Made with Unity, the 3D models are entirely created from the graphics engine, without any external tool, harmonizing the creative environment. These sculptural shapes make the game a relaxing and enveloping haven of peace, giving a floating feeling.</p>\n\n<p>Perle is embellished with a light, almost non-existent interface, in harmony with its world. Thus, the immersion is deeper, more emotional and reveals a video game in a simple visual setting. A system with a new style.</p>\n\r\nGame details :\u00a0https://www.azedune.com/perle", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:10:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c82/c8235851b250593c7a78c8817697553f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Azedune"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
