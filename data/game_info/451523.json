As in the canon comic stories and animated series, the attack takes place in Wayne&#39;s manor during the New Year&#39;s Eve Ceremony. The city is now fenced off by impenetrable frozen walls, with only two districts available. Batman will visit old locations modified by walls of ice and also a new one created for the DLC - GothCorp building. During the course of the game Batman will get access to the XE suit for extreme temperatures armed with thermal batarangs and thermal gloves. Along with old enemies seen in the original game, new enemies are introduced - henchmen armed with cryogenic guns who can freeze Batman and other foes.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2014-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-16T01:03:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8c/c8ce0fa203ada203b253a15774f7f7c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.65, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 16, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Warner Bros.
