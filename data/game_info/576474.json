Learn to fly the TG66, an instruction and rescue helicopter in the mountains! Test your skills in controlling this machine in the most adverse conditions that nature presents us with. Helicopter Simulator VR 2021 brings 6 different fuselage configurations, a super detailed mountain scenery, with power plants, cable cars, power lines, hospitals, airports and much more! You will be impressed!<br/><br/>Learn, hone and master all the instruments and controls of a real helicopter! Follow the tutorials to turn the aircraft on and off, learn to use ropes and flares and apply your knowledge in missions based on real situations!<br/><br/>We created a helicopter based on real life. The sequence of turning on and handling must be strictly followed, with the risk of the helicopter gets stuck. But that's ok! That's why there are flight simulators to train your skills and get better and more proficient.<br/><br/><strong>VR Cockpit and Extreme Realism</strong><br/>\u2022 All cockpit instruments work like they do in real life. Pay attention to your RPM and altitude at all times. You will find that flying a helicopter is much cooler and more challenging than you ever imagined.<br/>\u2022 Fly too high, close to the operational ceiling or if you fly too close to the mountain walls you will notice changes in the aircraft's behavior. We care a lot about physics and everything a real-life pilot faces when performing mountain rescues.<br/><br/><strong>Test and Hone Your Flight</strong><br/>\u2022 Weather \u2013 choose the weather conditions of your flight and challenge yourself even more by flying in storms and with little visibility.<br/>\u2022 Aerodynamic Control and Ambient Perception - Flying at high altitudes and sweeping over the mountains will separate good pilots from apprentices. Rescues will be needed in the mountains and these skills are imperative!<br/><br/><strong>Physics, the \"state-of-the-art\"</strong><br/>\u2022 All helicopter control surfaces interact and are impacted by physics throughout the flight, bringing unprecedented flight reality! And using your virtual reality headset you will be immersed in a truly incredible experience!<br/>\u2022 Weather, wind, altitude, speed and attitude of the helicopter will be felt. During missions, you will have to transport passengers, cargo and even trees using the external rope attached to your skis. Complete control of the helicopter will be very important!<br/><br/><br/>Helicopter Simulator VR 2021*: If you want to have the best virtual reality experience of your life, it's here!<br/><br/>MAIN FEATURES<br/>\u2022 Incredibly Detailed cockpit and models.<br/>\u2022 Interact with 100% of flight instruments<br/>\u2022 Miles and miles of snow mountains, lakes and wonderful landscapes.<br/>\u2022 6 different helicopter liveries.<br/>\u2022 12 advanced missions.<br/>\u2022 Free flight and hours of aircraft piloting and learning.<br/>\u2022 Living scenery, with cable cars, animals and characters, as VIPs and employees on an oil rig and power plant.<br/><br/><br/>Helicopter Simulator VR 2021 was developed by aviation enthusiasts who accepted the challenge of bringing the best VR experience to life!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T04:00:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/680/68050257d7b693af038961edddd23de4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Helicopter Simulator"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Helicopter Simulator"], "esrb_rating": null}
