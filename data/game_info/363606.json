It might be the field of inhabitants of a particular castle, or of the teeth on the crocodile that swallowed the world one day, or of the people loved by the Queen as of her last day on earth.\u00a0</em><em>All of these things are Fields. All Fields are all of these things.\"</em></p>\n<p>This is a solo RPG in which you create a Field, like one of the examples above. You will solve problems and\u00a0redefine the rules of the game and, eventually, create something beautiful.</p>\n<p>In other words, play this game to create, discover, and name a place that is your own-- the Field.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the #DREAMJAM. It's my MATHDREAM.</p><p>Currently there's only Chapter 1. I'd love to make Chapter 2 at some point.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T08:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e98/e98ab01e2bc83f73bbb7bf4f5ee6c76a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Natalie"], "genres": ["RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
