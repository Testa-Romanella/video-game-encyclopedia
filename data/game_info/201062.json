It mostly consisted of observing the children's classes and organizing the books that were donated. I\u00a0choose this as my experience because I\u00a0couldn't think of much else in my life that I\u00a0could gamify.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0thought that messing around with the many objects, trying to find bugs, was the most fun part about making this. Modeling was probably the least fun thing to do. In that same thought, the hardest thing to do was mostly art because it takes a lot of time. The easiest thing to do was most likely implementing sounds and text in conjunction with the main mechanic of placing books.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/560b3ddd760a77d921eb7da4c1e0bfbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SJtre"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
