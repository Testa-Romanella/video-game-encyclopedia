{"id": 574432, "slug": "ruins-of-ancient-mushrooms", "name": "Ruins of Ancient Mushrooms", "name_original": "Ruins of Ancient Mushrooms", "description": "<p>Submitted to the 7DRL as unfinished! <br/></p>\n<p>This was originally written for the Alakajam #11. However, all I managed to get done in AKJ11 was the maze algorithms. I drew some tiles, made a screenshot, and submitted it to unrated to AKJ11, even though the game didn't do anything.</p>\n<p>I saw the 7DRL and I saw that I could use existing code. So, I took my maze algorithms. I fixed it all up and made it so that it didn't crash. In a week I transformed it from screenshot capable to game capable.</p>\n<p>But, as of Sunday, the last day of the 7DRL, the monsters aren't yet implemented. I think it will take one day to implement monsters, then one more day to implement the boss monster at the bottom of the dungeon.</p>\n<p>I decided I wouldn't press myself to finish it, so I  submitted it as unfinished. However, I do plan on taking a couple more  days to finish it.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>I also see, as I am submitting it, that we aren't supposed to be continuing work on the same game. So perhaps I am cheating by submitting it to the 7DRL, since arguably I started before the time allotted. At the time I joined, I had thought using previous code and art would not be a problem. Now, at best, I can argue that there was no game implemented before, though the design and such are definitely a continuation. If a 7DRL admin object I will remove myself from the 7DRL list of games.<br/></p>\n<p>There is a bug in the maze algorithm that I have not yet found. The maze is a List of elements linking to each other; once in a great while your character will find himself in a wrong element or in a null element during his explorations. I am still hunting down that bug.<br/><br/>Arrows move the character around. \"&gt;\" and \"&lt;\" to go up and down stairs; on the overland map, the \"ruins\" are the down stairs.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T09:12:17", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Laaph"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
