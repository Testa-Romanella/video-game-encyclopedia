{"id": 300118, "slug": "m-drive", "name": "\u03bc-DRIVE", "name_original": "\u03bc-DRIVE", "description": "<p><strong>\u03bc-DRIVE</strong> is a PC rhythm game that draws heavy inspiration\u00a0from arcade games such as Sound Voltex and\u00a0ONGEKI.</p>\n<p>This is an <strong>early, pre-alpha release</strong>, destined to gauge interest and receive initial feedback from players. <strong>J</strong><strong>oin the Discord</strong>\u00a0to hang out with other players, download charts and talk to the developer!</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li><strong>An innovative control scheme</strong>, using the entire keyboard to replicate the feeling of\u00a0arcade controllers.<ul><li>Note that some keyboards limit how many keys can be pressed at once - these keyboards\u00a0might appear to drop inputs. For this reason, playing on an N-Key Rollover keyboard (most mechanical keyboards\u00a0should support this) is strongly recommended.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Support for rhythm game controllers,</strong>\u00a0specifically Sound Voltex / K-Shoot Mania controllers with a Keyboard mode.</li><li><strong>In-game chart editor </strong>- seamlessly transition between editing and playing your charts without installing any separate software.</li></ul>\r\nPlanned\r\n<ul><li><strong>Extended rhythm game controller support</strong> - IIDX, Pop'n Music, CHUNITHM, maybe even fight sticks?<ul><li><strong>RGB Support\u00a0</strong>for keyboards with an SDK</li></ul></li><li><strong>Story mode</strong> to provide an environment for players to learn and improve.</li><li><strong>Extensive tutorials</strong>, covering everything from basic \"how to play\" to advanced, controller-specific techniques.</li><li><strong>Character unlock and progression system</strong>, entirely unmonetized, to satisfy those of us with collection addiction ;)</li><li><strong>Online platform\u00a0</strong>for high scores, music sharing and potentially multiplayer.</li><li><strong>A player ranking system</strong> that respects competitive integrity. Scores using character-related bonuses will be scored on a separate leaderboard.</li></ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>It's a rhythm game - hit notes to score points. However,\u00a0\u03bc-DRIVE has a few additional mechanics on top of that.</p>\r\nGame Systems\r\n<ul><li>Your <strong>Life\u00a0</strong>determines whether you pass or fail a song. Currently, you immediately fail once it reaches\u00a00 - eventually, an option will be added to continue playing but having the play be considered a\u00a0\"Fail Clear\".</li><li>The\u00a0<strong>Sync Rate</strong> is equivalent to the score in other rhythm games. It goes up to 1,000,000 and depends on your timing accuracy.</li><li>The <strong>Battle\u00a0</strong><strong>System</strong> is where\u00a0\u03bc-DRIVE\u00a0differs from other rhythm games.<ul><li>During gameplay, enemy ships while fly by and shoot your ship. They cannot be avoided, and getting\u00a0hit reduces your\u00a0<strong>Life</strong>.</li><li>Certain note types, upon being hit, trigger a\u00a0<strong>BURST RELEASE</strong>. If a\u00a0<strong>BURST RELEASE</strong> occurs while an enemy ship is in front of you,\u00a0your ship will shoot it. If your\u00a0<strong>Charge</strong> is greater than their\u00a0<strong>Shield</strong>, it will be destroyed, preventing it from shooting you.</li></ul></li><li>At the end of the song, you receive a\u00a0<strong>Battle Grade</strong> depending on how many ships you destroyed and a\u00a0<strong>Skill Grade</strong> depending on your final\u00a0<strong>Sync Rate</strong>. You also receive a\u00a0<strong>Clear Type:</strong><ul><li><strong>COMPLETE</strong><strong>:</strong> You completed the track without failing.</li><li><strong>ALL CLEAR</strong>:\u00a0You did not let a single enemy escape.</li><li><strong>FULL COMBO:</strong> You did not miss a single note.</li><li><strong>FULL BURST:</strong> You hit every note with a rating of\u00a0<strong>BURST</strong> or better.</li><li><strong>CRITICAL FULL BURST:\u00a0</strong>You hit every note perfectly, with a rating of\u00a0<strong>BURST CRITICAL\u00a0</strong>or\u00a0<strong>BURST RELEASE.</strong></li><li><strong>FAILED</strong>: You failed before the end of the track.</li></ul></li></ul>\r\nNote Types\r\n<p>No matter which\u00a0input device you are using, it will be separated in three colored areas, depicted in the diagram at the end of this section.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strike notes</strong> are hit by pressing a key within the colored area corresponding to it. Depending on the timing, they may be scored as <strong>BURST CRITICAL</strong>, <strong>BURST </strong>or <strong>HIT</strong>, increasing your\u00a0<strong>Charge</strong> and adjusting your\u00a0<strong>Sync Rate</strong>.</li><li><strong>Release Strikes</strong> appear as larger Strike notes. They are hit by pressing 2 keys within the same color area at the same time. Successfully hitting it will trigger a <strong>BURST RELEASE.</strong></li><li><strong>Hold notes</strong> are the same as strike notes, except the key must stay held down until the hold ends.</li><li><strong>Dash notes</strong> must be hit by rapidly moving across them in the direction of the arrow. Hitting one also triggers a\u00a0<strong>BURST RELEASE</strong>.</li><li>Collecting yellow\u00a0<strong>e</strong><strong>nergy orbs</strong> increases your damage multiplier. Missing one does not count as a\u00a0<strong>MISS</strong>, and does not end your combo.</li><li>Getting hit by red\u00a0<strong>damage orbs</strong> reduces your\u00a0<strong>Life</strong>.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nEditor\r\n<p>To create a new chart, for now the easiest way is to copy an existing chart folder and replace the audio file and\u00a0album cover with yours. You can then delete every element in the editor, set the BPM and offset to your values and begin charting. Eventually, using an existing chart as a base\u00a0will not be necessary.</p>\n<p>For support, ask on Discord.</p>\r\nMiscellaneous\r\n<p>To prevent you from accidentally hitting system keys such as Alt-Tab or the Windows key, the game intercepts and blocks windows from receiving\u00a0all keyboard input during gameplay. This lets you use the whole keyboard as you wish.\u00a0If you wish to disable it for any reason,\u00a0pressing\u00a0F12 during gameplay toggles\u00a0Exclusive Input.</p>\n<p>You might have concerns about getting\u00a0stuck without keyboard input\u00a0if the game malfunctions at all. If an application exits or becomes completely unresponsive, Windows will automatically remove the block. \u00a0If it somehow fails to detect that the game has become unresponsive, Ctrl-Alt-Del cannot be blocked for technical reasons and can always be used to close the game.</p>\r\nAudio credits\r\n<p><strong>Memories</strong> by Loud Software:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ke93WupuwejfDPMY86Pqg</p>\n<p><strong>Necrofantasia Remix</strong> by Shred VII<br/></p>\r\nLicense stuff\r\n<ul><li>Newtonsoft.JSON licensed under the MIT License.</li><li>Smash:\u00a0Copyright (c) 2017, Alexandre Mutel</li><li>xxHash: Copyright (c) 2012-2014, Yann Collet</li><li>UnityRawInput (slightly modified by me)\u00a0licensed under the MIT License</li></ul>\n<p>Everything listed above requires me to include this disclaimer:</p>\n<p>\u00a0THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
