And it turns out this way the game is ideal for touch controls :) It is really good for passing time on the Tube (Subway) between stations.</p><p>This demo doesn't contain a full 3d map, but lots of other features are shown: hexagonal maps, piramids that make you shorter, paths, and skill settings, so you can get either relaxing or challangeing gameplay. I honestly hope some of you will like it ;)</p><p>Hope you like long snakey snakes ;)</p><p>Contact - csomakk@gmail.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aca/acaadff94aca02c23a284c363b844d85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["csomakk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
