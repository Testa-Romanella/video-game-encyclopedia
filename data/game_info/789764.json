Tesla is a control ability developed for a damage-dealing oriented character which provides them better sustain and area denial capabilities.\u00a0By activating Tesla, the player will cover themselves in a shield which partially absorbs damage received, and that damage can then be released in a magnetic explosion which slows enemies and leaves the ground electrified.</p>\n<p>\u00a0In this project, we strive to provide an ample level where this ability can be thoroughly tested.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---------------------------------\u00a0</p>\n<p>Platforms: Windows PC</p>\n<p>\u00a0----------------------------------</p>\n<p>\u00a0Credits</p>\n<p>Adam Murray- Producer Audio Production,\u00a0adammurray.2000@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Jaroslav Gasinec- Lead Gameplay developer, Co-Producer, System Administrator, Audio Programmer, tech support, 3D Model support, Technical Artist\u00a0\u00a0https://jarkog212.wixsite.com/portfolio</p>\n<p>Adam Hughes - Lead technical artist, Engine programmer, Tools programmer,\u00a0\u00a0https://ahughesformal.wixsite.com/ahughes/projects</p>\n<p>Malvine Haubenreisser - AI developer, Gameplay Programmer,\u00a0 malvinehaub@gmail.com \u00a0</p>\n<p>Pedro Rodrigues Correia Nande\u00a0- Lead Game designer, Level designer, UI Programmer, QA assurance,\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-nande/\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Hannah Ross - Art director UI artist, 3D artist, Texture Artist, Concept Artist, Graphic design,\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/hannahosso\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Callum Glen- 3D artist, Prop and Weapon Design,\u00a0callumglen1985@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Ewan Cassidy - Composer, SFX artist,\u00a0@EwanMakesGames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-21T00:06:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/710/71098d079e3fe72c704cb26b4f5c2087.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Venus"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
