You can do that by either exploring the tower or by fighting against skeletons.</p>\n<p>On each stage of the tower you have two rooms (one on the right, one on the left). You can access these rooms as often as you want. After the coin is collected, it despawns. After fighting against the skeleton (regardless of winning or losing), it will stay in the room.</p>\n<p>When facing a skeleton, there will show up a task you have to do (Press W/A/S or D). If you are able to push the button in\u00a0 a short amount of time, you will get points, otherwise you will lose a heart.</p>\n<p>Good luck and please comment your score (I am very curious) :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T05:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/068/0685949dffad26b7f57d4c7400dfc73b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TuggiPlays"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
