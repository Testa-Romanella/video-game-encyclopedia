{"id": 805377, "slug": "the-poossessor", "name": "The Poossessor", "name_original": "The Poossessor", "description": "<p>PLEASE READ HOW TO PLAY BEFORE PLAYING\u00a0:</p>\n<p>You are the Poossessor and you must\u00a0protect the Omniturd, while also using\u00a0it to protect you. There are two types of obstacles. The\u00a0first type (black poo pillar with green snot)\u00a0can only hurt the Omniturd (the turd sprite on the far left)\u00a0and has no\u00a0affect on The Poossessor.\u00a0 The second type (Brown poo pillar with green snot on its sides, can only hurt The Poossessor and has no\u00a0affect on the Omniturd).\u00a0Fire LMB projectiles\u00a0at the Omniturd to\u00a0 make it bounce up through the gap of\u00a0his obstacles, press Q to switch the projectile on LMB to a higher bounce projectile, and press Q again to\u00a0switch back (green projectile is for low jump, purple projectile is for high jump). Press RMB to fire the Omniturd\u00a0projectiles (white)\u00a0at the brown poo pillars that are not covered with green snot to destroy them in order to create a path for The Poossessor to get through safely (shooting the Omniturd projectile\u00a0at the brown poo pillars that HAVE the green snot on them does nothing, only the brown poo pillars WITHOUT the snot on them can be destroyed). The game if over if a) Omniturd makes physical contact with the black poo pillar obstacle, b)The Poossessor makes physical contact with the brown poo pillar obstacle, c) The Poossessor make physical contact with the brown poo pillars near the\u00a0screen bounds.\u00a0Two must act as one\u00a0in order to survive the 7 minute stage.</p>\n<p>NOTE: When you open the game page, don't click outside of the screen, otherwise there may be issues getting keyboard input to the game.</p><p>if the mouse cursor disappears (webgl's fault) press escape. Also, if the keyboard stops responding (also webgl's fault) just reload the game....
