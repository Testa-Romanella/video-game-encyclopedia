I am really excited about sharing this game as it is for my first Game Jam, actually, this is my first finished game as well. Galaxy Jam is very short and could be boring for some, but I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>\n<p>The theme of the Game Jam was \"Less is More\" and I represented that through the art of the game, which is very simple and minimalist, and also through the mechanics, as I focused on only one mechanic: avoiding obstacles by moving a spaceship.</p>\n<p>I look forward to receiving your feedback! :)</p>\n<p>Ps. Totally forgot about this, the controls are WAD :)</p><p><strong>UPDATE (This will apply once the Jam is over):\u00a0</strong><br/></p><p>I improved the collisions a little bit to make it a bit more challenging, also, if you get stuck in the ground after falling from the sky, just press Spacebar to reset the position :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ca/7ca8ce28ac034ad51e2f387e39859b13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["a_quantum_enigma"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
