The monsters of the game are creating chaos and spreading hate all over the way, that's why Cupid's getting mad (they are basically making his job harder).\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a limitation as well: '<em>Your score serves a purpose</em>'. However, being this our first project ever, we had little to no time at all to implement this the way we wanted.</p>\n<p>We tried our best to do all the thing we originally planned, but we had a hard time on doing certain things. We will continue to finish and polish the game though.</p>\n<p>Any feedback or comment will be gratefully receive.</p>\n<p>Note: ver 0.2 is a little more playable. (But not the original one\u00a0sent for the jam).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T16:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/644/644b398b7e44776d629bde1579fbe768.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sauttize", "MrBenj12"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
