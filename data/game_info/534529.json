Both this and the previous one,\u00a0Heal 'em up, are submissions to the Godot Wild Jam.</p>\n<p>It's not much by any means, but I think it turned out to be a fun little game. I certainly had fun making it!</p>\n<p>The rules are simple: catch eggs with your basket, which you control with your mouse. Don't catch two of the same kind! If you do very well, your time will get reduced next time.</p><p>Github:\u00a0https://github.com/pmarkee/Meggmorize</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T04:02:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c4/8c429199b123f6788929a9d8addd9170.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["pmarkee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
