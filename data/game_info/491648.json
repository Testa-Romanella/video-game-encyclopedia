Your task will be to build the most developed city. You build a house in the city so that the inhabitants can move in, and as the number of inhabitants increases, you unlock new buildings. In addition to building housing, you also need to provide your residents with the items they need and provide stores where they can buy them. The more inhabitants there are in the city, the more resources you have to produce. Raw materials you produce in factories, some use only money for production, others use other resources. The more factories you build in the city, the higher their maintenance costs and pollution will affect the production of plants on your farms.
