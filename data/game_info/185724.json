You can get<br/>Processing from https://processing.org. Older versions probably don't work but<br/>it won't hurt to try.</p><p>If it complains about missing images, try manually adding the image files from the .zip (the *.png files) to the processing sketch once it's open.<br/></p><p>GAMEPLAY<br/>=======<br/><br/>A two-button \"action\" \"platformer!\"<br/><br/>Use the 'a' and 'z' keys to give hints to the AI. If it gets stuck, change the<br/>AI mode with TAB. Collect the powerups to upgrade your abilities:</p><p> fins -- swim freely in water<br/> rope -- climb on vines<br/> torch -- see farther<br/> satchel -- harvest and plant vines (keep one vine at a time in your inventory)<br/> bucket -- draw and pour water (keep a bit at a time in your inventory)<br/> shovel -- dig and place dirt (keep one block at a time in your inventory)<br/> pick -- mine out stone<br/><br/> key -- unlock the door to the next level<br/><br/>Each level has two doors: a locked door leading further down and an unlocked<br/>door leading back upwards.</p><p>Keep in mind that the orb's thought-bubble tells you a bit about what the AI is<br/>thinking. Sometimes it's useful to tell the AI to reevaluate its current goal<br/>using the '!' item.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["solsword"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
