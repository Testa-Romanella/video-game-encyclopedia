The updates are frequent, but I can't imagine the final release and content as of now.</p>\n<p><em>As an (unwilling) prototype fighter pilot, you are trapped in an endless testing facility, bad for you. They don't know what you and the machine you pilot are capable of, bad for them. After your escape attempt the defense AI is ordered to destroy you, but  can not break your shields - yet it's silicon brain thinks it\u00a0deals damage as long as it can register a hit, forcing itself into a loop of trying over and over again... then break it by not taking a single hit! Wiping out waves after waves of never-ending drones while dodging the stream of\u00a0projectiles, you make the AI logic advance further and further, and the enemies more fierce, - with a hope it fails at some point, granting your escape.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Ever wondered what a classic side-scroller would look and feel like as a detailed simulator?
