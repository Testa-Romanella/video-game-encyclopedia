Learn to find a safe way under enemies' heavy fire. <br/><br/><strong>Tactics </strong><br/>Choose the most dangerous enemies and kill them first! Learn all of your opponent's tricks. Use short time to rest in order to prepare your weapons for battle. Try to stay in that area, where it will be easier for you to protect yourself. <br/><br/><strong>Evolution </strong><br/>Evolve into a more advanced mechanism. Your character is too weak to beat all the enemies without training. Gain points, level-up your character, give him new abilities.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a302fa4210ff77802d9c2209e50f427.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vessen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
