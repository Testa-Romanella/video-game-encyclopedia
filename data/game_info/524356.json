You live with your girlfriend Lydia who is also an addict. Along the way you will meet several other women and have the chance to romance, or ultimately corrupt them. There will be many important decisions to make on your journey that will lead you either down a path to redemption or debasement. Will you make the choice to keep living the only life you know, by whatever means necessary, or will you embrace a new way of life. This is entirely up to you...</p>\n<p>Although the game contains heavy subject matter there is plenty of humanity and humor as well. These are not street bum junkies. I wanted to shed light on what it's like to be addicted to drugs, and what it takes to maintain that or ultimately say enough is enough and choose to get clean. This game is very personal to me based on past experience. All of the characters are fictional, but the lifestyle is not. Since I am anonymous here I would like to take the time to say I've been sober for over 12 years, just so no one thinks I'm currently living this life, but I certainly did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Patreon - Buy Me a Coffee - Discord<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad769ea468f44f881818ac52319c164e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ZoeyRaven"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
