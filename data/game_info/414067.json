I'm literally not going to even bother a little bit on calling this a \"game\".</p>\n<p>This is a shitpost.</p>\n<p>What is a shitpost you may be asking? Well, basically it's a really really really really really bad made game. But it's made with poor quality ON PURPOSE, it's made to make you cry and reflect, to inflict you psychological pain. Once you have finished playing this game you will ask yourself some questions such as:</p>\n<p>\"Why have I played this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why does this even exist anyways?\"</p>\n<p>And much more questions.</p>\n<p>The worst thing of all is that it's not that painful as I'm saying.</p>\n<p>Remember, I have warned you, don't complain. You are fully responsible for playing this shitpost.</p>\n\n<p>Five Nights at Freddy's by Scott Cawthon.</p>\n<p>Menu Music: <br/></p>\n<p>Jumpscare: <br/></p>\n<p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy_NKN75Jhw&amp;t <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:29:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd7/dd793d3c6f07f3c8bf4997f13db14cc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dvelop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
