Please consider this a warning - you probably do not want to play this :)</p>\n<p>If you're absolutely determined... this is a small game in which you match riders with horses. If you get the right horse for a rider, they'll have a lovely time and be very happy, and you'll get points. If you get the wrong horse, the rider might be bored, or scared, or even fall off.</p>\n<p>Make it to 50 points and you win! You can skip riders at any time if you don't think you have a good horse for them, or restart if your randomly allotted horses are just no good (...we know you love them all equally, really, though...).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/188/188a2af28552b5bf63a345a3f187ff28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Roan"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
