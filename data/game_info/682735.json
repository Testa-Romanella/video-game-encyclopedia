There's a character fighting pitbulls and opposing champions fighters, along with guards and more. But as Co-Founder of Outhouse Media, Brian 'Outhouse' Owens, says, it's much more than a second-rate sports game.\n\nThe game is entirely violent. It's post-apocalyptic, and it even has a soundtrack that's utterly ferocious when blasting through your enemies' defenses.\n\nIt'll be released in the but August for the PSP, PS Vita, Playstation 3 and PC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:41:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/821/82138a7de668759d0dbdecea56fee16d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
