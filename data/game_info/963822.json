{"id": 963822, "slug": "cabezurrio-vs-robots", "name": "Cabezurrio vs Robots", "name_original": "Cabezurrio vs Robots", "description": "Platform game in which we control Cabezurrio, a soldier who must collect all the gems and destroy all the robots in its path in several different scenarios. We have a rifle with which to shoot the robots. It is necessary to shoot the robots several times to destroy them. The robots will shoot at us and try to stop us from achieving our goal. There are also missile launchers or explosive balls that will try to reach us. The game immerses us in endless explosions, and we must know how each robot behaves in order to eliminate them as efficiently as possible. We do not have a limit of shots, so we can create a hail of bullets.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has 3 stages (desert, night desert and jungle) and 5 difficulty levels, for a total of 15 stages. To pass to the next stage we must collect all the gems and destroy all the robots that can be destroyed (there is a type of robot that can not be destroyed). As the difficulty level increases we will have to get more gems and destroy more robots. In addition, other elements of the game will make passing the track more and more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe jungle scenario contains animals that we cannot eliminate, so our mission will be to avoid them and collect the gems, which are contained in chests that we must shoot to open them. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt the beginning we can set the number of initial lives (10, 20, 30 or 40), being another way to choose the difficulty level.<br/>\r\nThe movement of the character is controlled by keyboard. We must choose key to move left, move right, jump, shoot and pause the game. If we are playing by pressing the pause button a menu will appear with which we can continue playing, return to the main menu or exit the game. If we press the pause button again the game will continue.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-24T02:09:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/414f6831154a2afa79cc919c429d37a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alberto Cuevas Alvarez"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Alberto Cuevas Alvarez"], "esrb_rating": null}
