{"id": 854249, "slug": "battle-of-pearl-harbor", "name": "Battle of Pearl Harbor", "name_original": "Battle of Pearl Harbor", "description": "<p>My first ever game made in Unity. It is a defence game where a lone battleship in the water wards off the enemy planes attacking the harbour.\u00a0As of now, the core gameplay is functional. There are four waves of enemies to fight through and not a lot of ammo to completely fill your cannons. Conserve your cannonballs and bombs as the difficulty will only ramp up.</p>\n<p>Please note: There is no pause menu implemented into the game, neither is there a main menu. The game will however pause when the window isn't focused.\u00a0All recognisable sound effects belong to their respective owners.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T17:04:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cf/1cf29c2107c6f386863e50c3c71bc526.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donabrowns"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
