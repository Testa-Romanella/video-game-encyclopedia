{"id": 288242, "slug": "the-lightkeeper", "name": "The Lightkeeper", "name_original": "The Lightkeeper", "description": "<p><strong>The Lightkeeper</strong> is a small action-adventure game inspired by Metroid.</p>\n<p>As the new lightkeeper, you set out to investigate strange noises coming from the basement of your house. The story (told through item descriptions and environmental clues) has a Lovecraft vibe, as you discover the cosmic horrors that lies beneath the lighthouse.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is complete, with 2 to 3 hours of gameplay. You can explore six major areas, fight a dozen enemies (including four unique bosses), and discover many powerups and keys to gradually unlock the world map.</p>\n<p>However, it's still a bit rough around the edges. Many \"quality-of-life\" features are missing, and the sound design is a bit crude. I plan to continue working on the game in the following months. Right now, you can think of it as an \"early access release\".</p>\n<p>Still, I hope you will enjoy it. Let me know in the comments!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b300b0aa1e09135234af71a7b3949f08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atelier Dreamnoid"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
