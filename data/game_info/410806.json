I'm famous", "description": "Description\r\n<p>Two teams of robots race to gather their master computer parts and reassemble them. Each team try to reproduce the computer configuration pattern : the blue one is displayed on the top-left corner of the screen, the red one on the bottom-right corner.</p>\n<p>The first team that reproduces its pattern wins. Your are free to put the parts anywhere on the map. the only condition is to have a matching-pattern somewhere on the map.<br/></p>\n<p>Any robot can pick a part. At this point the part takes its carrier color. When your try to take an opponent-coloured part, you will have to wait for a while in front of it, until its color changed back to yours. That means it is easier and faster to take a white part than an enemy-coloured one. But it is not safe to let your opponent finish its pattern before you. It is up to your team to decide which strategy you will use.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was performed during the Global Game Jam 2020 event in Cergy - FRANCE.
