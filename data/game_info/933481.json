You are an explorer on a space journey flying to a faraway land. However, to power your spaceship, you must fill it with energy before it runs out. Aliens guard the rare mineral the spaceship needs and shoot bullets at you. Use WASD to move and click to shoot. You can carry 3 energy at a time, but make sure to deliver it before your timer runs out! You also have 3 lives, so don't touch any aliens or get shot. Every 5 energy you deliver, you will regain a life. Deliver your energy to the cargo area of the ship and power it for your travels!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T10:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/820/82088395b9f156c1f21ba84a4100dd2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MysticalPiano"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
