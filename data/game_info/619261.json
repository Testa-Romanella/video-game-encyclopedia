The theme was \"Bound Together.\"</p>\n<p>This is sort of a thematic mirror to Swivel on It!, my entry for last year's event. Instead of being a guy trying to survive the zombie apocalypse, you instead play as whatever strange necromantic force guides the zombies. The controls are pretty simple: just click and drag to float about, and the zombies will congregate behind you (unless they're busy eating people's faces).</p>\n<p>This game uses assets from the Kenney Top-down Shooter pack, and the sounds from <em>Swivel on It</em> (plus a few additional ones recorded very quickly). The music tracks are from Yadu Rajiv's Mini Loops.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to see how this was put together, you can download the project and open it in GDevelop 5. Downloadable versions of the game itself are provided but mostly untested. Linux works fine and Android has only minor issues with overlapping music tracks, but I can't be sure how solid the Windows/MacOS builds are.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:03:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/7245bc3d42c86eec99982af426515dbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Damon L.
