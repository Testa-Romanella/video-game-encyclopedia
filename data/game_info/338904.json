Updated\u00a0to Unity 2019.1.8f1 for the jam.<br/><br/>Original plan was to make a mashup between Worms and Scorched Earth, with online multiplayer. Way overscoped for a first game, but I learned a lot.\u00a0What I got done was 2-players (hot seat), 2 tanks per player, 1 bullet type, player/tank HP, terrain destruction, game over, some sound effects (no music).</p>\n<p>I don't think I'll be continuing this game as I\u00a0have others going now. But I hope you will enjoy it.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>- Move: Left and Right arrows<br/>- Aim: Up and Down arrows<br/>- Shoot: Space</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T04:47:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b5/5b5c2c3970a07a04dcc794ae58001a90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lilou_cormic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
