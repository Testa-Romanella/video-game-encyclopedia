Your only goal for this game is to jump. Yea. That's it! All you need to do is jump as high as you can (or you can just mash the space bar, but still.) Take a journey in this inspirational and life-changing experience for you to Explore, Jump, and get that world record for the highest a man as ever jumped. Are you up to the challenge of just sitting there, wasting your precious time pressing on a space bar for hundreds of times just to see the dwarf planet Pluto? Are you up to the challenge of making yourself disappointed because of this game where you literally press the spacebar over and over again for near to no reward? No? Then do it anyway!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>You play as a bean named Thomas. (i was too lazy to draw a human being so I made a bean instead.)\u00a0Your only dream in life is to get a world record for jumping the highest a man has ever jumped in human history. So, you made Blue Bull sponsor you for this challenge. You invest in some epic looking armor for you to wear, and with your engineering skills, you come up with a device that will make you jump thousands of times while you are in mid air, you also grab a computer mouse 'cause why not? With everything prepared and ready, you head down to the city central for you to take the challenge. You then start to jump.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>that's literally it.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T07:05:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e7bf12d6500ab2ff38a922f28546e86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheLuchenator"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
