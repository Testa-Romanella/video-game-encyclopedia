Their world crumbled. Now in this wasted world, life does as it always \u2014 it struggles to hang on. The rains come rarely anymore but rabbits learned to survive the harsh reality of the desert, long before humans ruined the world. As a desert rabbit, you\u2019ve learned to forage for scarce food mainly during dawn and dusk when the sun is muted, always keeping an ear out for hungry snakes, monitor lizards, kites, and dingos. The human survivors are an unpredictable danger as they still cling to their machines and their war, strewing chaos across the land. You once could have asked the ancestors for help \u2014 a trick rabbits learned from the bilby \u2014 but with the cataclysm came a strange terrifying Wind howling outside this world which tore apart the Dreaming.</p>\n<p><em>Apocalypse Warren is a playset for the tabletop roleplaying game The Warren.\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T05:43:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cad/cadc7c4be29a4c68b5eea11e803bbba4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Colinaut"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
