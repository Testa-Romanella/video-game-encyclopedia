You control a cute and small chamaleonic triangl... er... spaceship, yeah, that's it. Then there is this unending horde of rectangular and rhomboid enemy suicidal ships that have random colored shields. As a cute and small chamaleonic vessel, you can switch your color and... well, ok.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's it. There are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan and Magenta enemies, you switch color, fire the same color energy balls and destroy them. Yellow, Cyan and Magenta enemies need two hits, for example Yellow needs a Red ball hit and a Green ball (in any order).</p>\n<p>Sometimes there are rhomboid enemies. These enemies, when destroyed, grant your ship a powerup. If it was a single-colored rhomboid, your next shot will be of pure white energy, destroying everything on its path. If it was a dual-colored rhomboid, you still get the white energy shot, but when fired for a few seconds your ship and energy shots become dual-colored too (Red becomes Yellow, Green becomes Cyan and Blue becomes Magenta).</p>\n<p>And that's it... for now.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for giving a try to my VERY FIRST game.</p>\r\nSoftware used:\r\n<p>- KDE Neon 16.04 LTS<br/>- Godot Engine 3.0.2<br/>- Krita<br/>- Beepbox\u00a0 https://beepbox.co<br/>- Audacity</p>\r\nInstallation:\r\n<p>- Decompress the files (.zip / tar.gz)</p>\n<p>- Run RGBBlaster.exe (Windows), RGBLaster.x86_64 (GNU/Linux) or RGBlaster (MacOS)</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>- Left Arrow (Rotate 45 degrees anti-clockwise)<br/>- Right Arrow (Rotate 45 degrees clockwise)<br/>- Down Arrow (Quick 180 degrees turn)<br/>- Z (Change Color: Red -&gt; Blue -&gt; Green -&gt; Red.<br/>- X (Fire)<br/>- C (Change Color: Red -&gt; Green -&gt; Blue -&gt; Red.<br/>- Gamepad Supported.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4b/a4bc5ca999949ab16a72a0fa8c0f9b89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["McGnoll"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
