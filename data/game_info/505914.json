There might be a third mode coming if you people like the videogame; a party RPG, integrating the story of the Essence Reaper Ritual with the mechanics of this videogame. You decide!<br/><br/>FEATURES AND CONTENTS<br/>- Local multiplayer fantasy game, for 1-4 players, sharing same screen. <br/>- Steam Play Together. Invite your friends to play with you even if they dont own a copy. <br/>- An Arcade mode campaign, to play with your friends or solo. Hack and Slash. <br/>- A First Person mode, following the same campaign than that of the Arcade mode. <br/>- An Arena mode; gather your party, venture forth and face five waves of enemies, each wave of increasing difficulty. <br/>- 4 different characters, each one with their uniques skills and combat styles. <br/>- Subttile and menus in three different languages; English, French and Spanish. <br/>- Beta version will have one full playable level. As we move forward, up to 4 more leves will be added. <br/>- Each level is set up in a different atmosphere, with different enemies. <br/><br/>The idea of creating this videogame came in when spending time with our young family members (e.g. nephews and niece) playing a videogame. It should be easy to play, not too many buttons, yet plenty of fun. We are scripting from the very beginning everything to accommodate three languages; English, French and Spanish, so the videogame will be available en those three languages.<br/><br/>We just give you for now a video and a couple of screen capture of the first tests.<br/><br/>We are thinking on adding a script to be able to import your own pictures to the game, so instead of having the 4 portraits of each character, you may import yours. I bet my niece and nephews would love that.<br/><br/>Alpha version of the videogame, actual game play, is working well.<br/><br/>https://youtu.be/wJCqWFyNPww<br/><br/>Initial early version: integrating First Person Mode on split screen with main campaign, for up to 4 players;<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>GAME CONTROLLERS</strong><br/><br/>You may use;<br/><ul><li> Xbox One controllers <br/></li><li> Keyboard &amp; Mouse<br/></li><li> Mobile through local wifi.

I use Dialogue System from Pixel Crushers which allows easy integration, and for specific short texts as in the Main Menu, I have just hardcode it. Once you choose a language, Dialogue System keeps / save that info for the entire videgame, so upon load an scene, Dialogue System load all previous saved data including language chosen.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T03:37:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/531/53150dc070ff111a5be2a247adb98307.jpg", "website": "http://www.legendsofeternalia.com/?page_id=305&amp;lang=en", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alejandro Munilla"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alejandro Munilla"], "esrb_rating": null}
