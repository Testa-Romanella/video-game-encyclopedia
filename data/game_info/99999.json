The title was made for #gbjam 4. My initial idea was to make a small manic shoot 'em up that focusses on score attack and where you have to beat several endbosses in a row. I wasn't able to create more than one though.\r\n</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><ul>\n<li>Move: WASD / Xbox 360 Controller D-Pad or Analogue Stick</li>\n<li>Shoot: Space / A-Button</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Tips</strong></p><ul>\n<li>Hold the shoot button to move slowly, tap the button or release to move faster</li>\n<li>Graze bullets to increase your level and reach higher scores.</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tWhy no music?
