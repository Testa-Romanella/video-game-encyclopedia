This is no simple task; you will have to 'shapeshift' the tower to reach all the bonsai.

We cannot guarantee that you cannot get stuck if you do. If you do it anyway and do get stuck, you can press R to restart.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c9504e1f3455de799c34f6e812524b72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Lokkij"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
