Simply drag and drop the chosen herb to the slots and enjoy. You can click on the slots, or move back the items and blend a new tea!</p>\n<p>I know that there are some bugs still, will try to fix that later on, but did not really have time left for them. (Also, I am a very beginner :p )</p><p>(It might have resolution problems on mobile, thus I suggest playing on a PC/laptop)</p>\n<p>Anyways, hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T06:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/854a00cd0f420eccce5541154486fbaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hhelheim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
