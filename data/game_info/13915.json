After the mysterious events in the year 4089, the Overlord hasn't been heard from for the last millennium, and so the experimental robots have continued to wage war according to their program. Without the Overlord to repair the damage, Xax has fallen into a state of chaos and dereliction. However, a shadowy new power has risen... how will your presence turn its fate?<br/><br/>Shoot, sneak, build, talk, slash, buy, sell, fly, swing, hover, scavenge, teleport &amp; conquer your way through an endlessly generated planet.
