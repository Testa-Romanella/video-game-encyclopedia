The idea of this game is not to try to get the player to spend hours playing, but to try to be a game that you can play quickly and for a short time, to kill time while you wait for your friends to connect or while you wait to find a match. The game is pure luck, but don't let that from stopping you to try to beat your best score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0This game is still in development, it still lacks things like music, new animations, and polishing the UI, as you can see there are few things because the idea is to make a simple but fast game that does not take years to open and load.</p>\n\n\n<p>It's supposed to be a program on your PC so you can open it whenever you want, but I made this HTML version so you can test it first. However, when the game is done I will upload a free version for you to download, right now just enjoy the progress of the game while I work on the new updates.</p>\n<p>PD: Please feel free to use the comments section to give your ideas or to give feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T14:51:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0c/f0c8efa9a619bc87293eb3298752953b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mr.Bago"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
