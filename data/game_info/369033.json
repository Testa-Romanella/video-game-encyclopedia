Take control of a trio of righteous babes-huffy, headstrong Hikaru; spoiled, smarmy Umi; and bashful, brainy Fuu-as they embark on a fantastic quest that leads them from the tedium of a junior-high field trip to the terror of a journey into the unknown. Marvel as the girls awaken the magical powers lying dormant within themselves and use them to battle a motiay collection of foul creatures. Watch as the teenage threesome learn lessons about friendship, humility, and love. And enjoy the rewards of Action/RPG gameplay, spoken in-game dialogue, and nearly 20 minutes of hand-drawn animation as the newborn Magic Knights slowly uncover the shocking secret behind Cefiro&#39;s collapse into chaos... and blast their way toward destiny!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T15:05:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/761/7611bb06c59c3973eaff9978104d2f01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Working Designs"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
