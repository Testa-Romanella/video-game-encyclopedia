Its pretty simple, and I mainly created it so I could practice saving and loading data so I can better implement it in future games (Also the music is really bad)</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Its pretty simple, you just launch your blue ball at other balls to break them and get points, while avoiding the red spikey ones to not die. You can buy different abilities and try to get a new high score</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The only thing you need to play this game is a functional mouse, simply click and drag to throw the ball in the direction of your mouse. The farther from the ball your mouse is, the faster the ball will travel</p>\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<p>A potato could probably run this game, it isn't very graphically intense</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T10:13:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f3107e7eab765ba6b110e2084410cfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creeperbob16"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
