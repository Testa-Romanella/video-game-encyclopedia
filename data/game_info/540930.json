It's a racing game where you have to finish levels before the time ends. The game has a short story.</p>\n<p>It is still a demo, and I intend to finish the game in the future. The game should work on any low-end system. In the settings, you can change the quality and resolution.</p>\n<p>In the selection menu, you will see in the down left corner pretty basic instructions.</p>\n<p>When the game is fully completed and published, anyone that donated 1,50 or above will get the game automatically. Any donations from you guys will be helpful and every donation I get will be spent on finishing this game.</p>\n<p>I hope you like the game and I am looking forward to hearing your opinions on the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:40:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c29d84254b93306714c110390852f74f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bogisha"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
