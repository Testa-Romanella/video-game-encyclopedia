The player will embody a torn-apart doll waking up under the child\u2019s bed at sunset. The goal of the game is to get back all the lost appendages of the doll to recompose her body. In this purpose, the doll must find hidden credit cards to buy her parts at a toy shaped as a cash-register.\r\n\n\r\nYou are a little girl\u2019s doll, her big brother stole and torn apart. You have only an arm and a one-eyed head left, still attached to your torso. You wake up under the boy\u2019s bed wondering how you get here. With your only one eye left, you glance at a credit card toy beamed in the last rays of light. You crawl toward it and use it in the cash-register : the drawer opens containing your second eye. You take it back and can see perfectly now. You understand that you have to collect all your parts. How ? By using all the credit cards dispersed in the kiddle\u2019s bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINKA Charles - A5 - Producer &amp; Game Programmer\u00a0\r\nLACOMBLEZ Robin - A5 - Game Artist &amp; Game Programmer\r\nTHUILLIER Alan - A4 - Assistant Producer &amp;\u00a0Game Designer\r\nSALGUEIRA Damien - A3 - Game Designer &amp; Level Designer\u00a0\r\nALDEBERT Alexia - A3 - Assistant Producer &amp;\u00a0Game Designer &amp; Scenarist\r\nRIBEIRO Florian - A2 - Game Programmer\r\nRIBEIRO Adrien - A2 - Game Programmer\r\nRIBEIRO-ANSOULT K\u00e9vin - A2 - Game Designer &amp; Sound Designer\r\nOUDIN Marion - MBA - Assistant Producer &amp; Level Designer\r\n+ RAHAROLAHY Kevin - Sound Designer", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:01:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7c/d7c667855d67c84e592fc3c5bb76c21e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MissKyoko"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
