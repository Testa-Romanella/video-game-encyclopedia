In the spirit of Minecraft's Redstone system you have a few basic components you can use in this game. There is the LED, which is black when no electricity is applied and turns white when it is powered. You can arrange large amounts of LED's to emulate dot matrix displays that you can drive using logic circuitry you design using the transistor component (a simple and-gate). There is a switch and button that allow you to interact with the flow of current directly as the player. The intention of the game is to be purpose built to enable the creation of complex electronic devices like binary calculators or even computers (much like people create with Redstone).</p>\n<p><strong>DISCORD SERVER<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Here<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Looking For Developers<br/></strong></p>\n<p>If you believe in the concept of the game and would want to work together over the summer in Unity and C# to make this into something that would be worth trying to sell on Steam get in contact with me on the discord server. <br/>\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T08:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce0/ce0f29ab77edcee7b6213d413acdd3ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["M4RS_official"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
