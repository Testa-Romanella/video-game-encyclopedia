The idea is to ramp up massive combos and last as long as you can.</p>\n<p>Didn't get a lot of interest in it so I shelved it. It's not a life or death matter to pursue a combo, you can move through the game without it. So most folks never get invested in chaining for that sweet 40X. Not quite the case in Bump 1.</p>\n<p>Unlike the browser version, the desktop versions will save your best score and remind you of it on death.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f6/4f65b2346a711c92916f3b917a523bea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["st33d"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
