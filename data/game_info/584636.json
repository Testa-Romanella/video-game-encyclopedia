You are able to change various attributes about the primitive objects such as each color field individually and size. You are also able to toggle if a primitive object will automatically erase or not, in addition to clear the screen of all primitive objects. Updates were made to change other attributes of the primitive objects such as how much the primitive glows, the primitive's opacity, and how long before each primitive will destroy itself. A clock with a live readout of the time was also created, in addition to the functionality of switching between the time in the AM or the PM, and the lighting of the scene will reflect this change.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T05:12:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14e70fef9ca77f58cb564291b687d692.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bsingh0507"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
