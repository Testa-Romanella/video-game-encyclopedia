You have been tasked with the mission to enter the compound and\u00a0figure out what is going on, all without being seen.\r\nThis game was made for my Computer class in Highschool, It has no music because I was never able to get it working.\u00a0 It was made in GB Studio V1.2.1 Before any of the new game modes, meaning it was made using RPG elements. It was fun to have to figure out how to use simple RPG tools to make a stealth game and I think it turned out very well\r\n\r\nI want to\u00a0 create a DX version, but im not sure if that will actually happen, I also plan on remaking this game as a 3d stealth game similar to Metal Gear Solid 1.\u00a0\r\nThis game was made in about a month so if there is any weird art or story elements understand I was rushing to finish it.
