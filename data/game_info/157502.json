In the course of the four seasons, you'll find wild flowers burgeoning and blooming with secret fragrance, the stately trees put on their leaves and give a goodly shade, until wind and frost touch all with austerity, the water sinks low and the rocks at the bottom of the stream emerge. Climbing on mountain at morning and turning down at evening, the sceneries of the four seasons are various and the joy is also endless.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4d/e4d4b387f0a1b762ec87b466c21b14e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pocoapoco"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
