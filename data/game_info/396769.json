This was fully intended and expected, but an as-of-yet unknown error makes the HTML5 version unplayable for now.</li><li>Enemies were an intended part of gameplay, but they were cut at the last minute for time.</li><li>More levels were intended. The game was made heavily leaning on tilesets and autotiling making the game quick to build. I had wanted to make at least another two worlds, but that was unfeasible given the time limitations.</li><li>More puzzle mechanics beyond the locks-and-keys system, such as pushable blocks and portals were considered but also scrapped for both time and design conflicts.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>THEMES</strong></p><p>The theme for TriJam 47 was \"One Step to Death\"</p><p>The theme for Weekly Game Jam 125 was \"Dangerous Collection\"</p><p><strong>ASSETS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sound effects made using sfxr</li><li>Royalty free music from\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com</li><li>Art assets from\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91b/91b1b0442f878ce30785d5c8b178e90f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
