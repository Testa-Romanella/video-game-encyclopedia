The Klan-Men and Klan-Women will reveal themselves by taking their hoods on and off, but you should not get fooled by the hats of other people.\u00a0Use your mouse to poke the KKK off their ride before the short time runs out, or you will lose as you let hate aboard. The prototype mixes elements of aiming and timing with the flavor of classic hidden object games.</p>\n<p>The game is still on prototype level and might receive future updates, though it is playable now.</p>\n\n<p>BanTheKlan was created by <strong>David Mathews</strong> (Visual Development, Game Design, Sound) and <strong>Basil Sutter</strong> (Game Design, Programming, Sound) during five days of a <strong>Game Jam at Fantoche 2017</strong> in Baden, Switzerland.\u00a0</p>\n<br/>\n<p>David Mathews website: http://davidm.co</p>\n<p>Basil Sutter\u2019s website: http://basilsutter.tumblr.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/418/41841c15ded5f54f84437a602b6aec9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Basil Sutter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
