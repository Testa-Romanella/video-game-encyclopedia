You move to pick the ball, you shoot the ball to a wall to score. Walls will break after three scores.\u00a0If any goal gets destroyed, then it dissapears along with its related player.\u00a0 The game is supposed to end when there's only one player on the field.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\nMoveArrow Keys / WASDShootSpacebar / KSwitch camera (only if player is in the field)2Reset game1Quit gameEscape\r\nIf people like the game\r\n<p>If this game gets positive feedback I will start a proper development of it. The odds of this happening will increase if people support the game by donating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This are some of the features that could\u00a0be added to a possible full game:</p>\n<ul><li>Local Multiplayer.</li><li>8 characters battle royal.\u00a0</li><li>Victory screens.\u00a0</li><li>Showing results and scores.</li><li>The ability to steal the ball from the opponent.\u00a0</li><li>A different field.\u00a0 Different shape, no walls, anything.</li><li>A pause option.</li><li>Obstacles.</li><li>Strenght of shots.</li><li>Music and SFX.</li><li>Better AI.</li><li>Unique and charismatic characters.\u00a0</li><li>Colorblind support.</li><li><strong>Android version</strong>. Could happen.</li></ul>\r\nKnown issues\r\n<ul><li>Currently the game will not do anything when the battle royale has ended. If you are the winner, you can suicide after winning by auto-scoring your own wall. It's cathartic. Whoever won, you can play again by pressing 1.</li><li>The field's shape\u00a0could lead to the ball going to a corner. There can happen a softlock because the AI wouldn't try to take it out. This could be fixed by changing the shape of the field or by making the ball bouncier or other things.</li></ul>\r\nUpdates?\r\n<ul><li>Maybe there will be an optimization update since the code is a little bit all over the place. No issues, nothing hard to fix.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T02:43:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5b9f162fd3b30a0f99edab2d52ed50b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dinamic Creates"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
