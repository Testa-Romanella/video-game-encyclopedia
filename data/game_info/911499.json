You wake up in an abandoned cave, get a strange core, and then you will start your own adventure.<br/>\r\nMr. Black Rabbit is a robot, which means he cannot touch the water, but a mystery man gives the Black Rabbit the ability to avoid water through the core. However, the mystery man needs the Black Rabbit to deliver this core to his temporary residence.<br/>\r\nPlayers must avoid the rain while delivering the core to the destination, but the road will encounter a variety of dangerous situations and bad weather, such as heavy rain, hail, lightning, wind, snow \u2026<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is very simple. You only must use your four direction keys to control the character to jump, walk, slide, and fix. So, you can use your own inertia to overcome every situation.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T04:29:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f74/f7476c8f720b92d2599185208c1ea21b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u9ed1\u4e4b\u7fc5\u8180"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u9ed1\u4e4b\u7fc5\u8180"], "esrb_rating": null}
