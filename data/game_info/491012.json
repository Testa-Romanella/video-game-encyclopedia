Inside the complex where, every day, the entity questions world leaders about aspects of humanity - a potentially lethal process - an old scientist of unspecified gender is building a machine.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clinging to a few precious memories, with each passing day the scientist gathers components and toils on their obscure project, as the clock ticks relentlessly towards a horrifying climax.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I dream of you and ice cream is a point-and-click adventure game with a very simple interface and an emphasis on puzzle solving. For every two puzzles solved, players are rewarded with a partial solution which can be used in another puzzle.<br/><br/>There are no spoken lines or written dialogue in the game: Everything is communicated through speech bubbles, symbols and emotions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-16T15:23:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e38/e38658d245676a5f6d2ac64f48b4e6b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Emilios Manolidis", "Manolidis Aimilios Nikolaos"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Emilios Manolidis", "ManolidisAimilios"], "esrb_rating": null}
