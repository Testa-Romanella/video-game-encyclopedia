The rooms, the enemies, and the items you get are all randomly chosen each time you play, which makes each run a unique experience.<h3>&gt;&gt; A Gun That Shoots Meat</h3>As the name of the game suggests, the player is armed with guns that shoot meat. There are 4 guns to choose from, ranging from a pistol that shoots chicken nuggets to a sniper rifle that shoots sausages. However, the ammo serves a different purpose; because the ammo is meat, you can also eat it to recover health. To succeed, you must use your ammo wisely for both damage and healing.<h3>&gt;&gt; Rally The Troops</h3>Not only are there multiple guns to choose from, but multiple playable characters as well. There are 4 Military Extraction Troopers to choose from, ranging from the Assault Trooper, who can dash quickly to avoid bullets, to the Demolitionist, who can lay down proximity mines. Combine different troopers with different guns to get a new experience on every run.<h3>&gt;&gt; GMO Gone Wrong</h3>As the result of an experiment gone wrong, giant, sentient, radioactive vegetables have taken over The Facility. Your job as a Military Extraction Trooper is to venture into the research facility and wipe out the menace inside. You will fight enemies like broccoli, pea-pods, brussel sprouts and tomatoes, all armed with varying types of guns and weaponry.<h3>&gt;&gt; Upgrade Your Arsenal</h3>Of course, your Meatgun will not be the only weapon you have. Inside the Facility, you will find an item in each room, each one an experimental weapon designed by the Facility's scientists. There are over 30 unique items with differing effects, from hot sauce that burns your enemies to takeout boxes that increase your ammo capacity. Many items' effects combine together in surprising ways. You can even get multiple stacks of each item for a more powerful effect.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T03:08:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae1/ae116e6492ae5b99542e0e8f1ec6bd47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["candyhen127"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["candyhen127"], "esrb_rating": null}
