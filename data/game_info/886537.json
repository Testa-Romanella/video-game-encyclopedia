Your friend, the Guild Master of the Adventurer Guild, has asked you to take care of the Guild for 20 days. Seems easy enough, were it not for an unexpected incident. Can you take care of the problem before your friend returns?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some words from me</strong></p>\n<p>After working for more than a year on this game on my own, I feel like, I finally need some real feedback on the game. So I made a demo. It's my first game and I'm still not sure if I'm cut our for game development, so I like to hear what people might think of the game after playing the demo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I feel like that the demo still has a lot of rough edges(I tried my best to squash out any bugs in the demo I\u00a0could find)\u00a0but I still hope you can have fun with it.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0will keep on polishing the demo if there are any bugs left in it.(\u00a0Who am I kidding. Of course there will be T-T).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T05:38:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/642/64225bc183f54bfc2560999c5f75309e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GreenGuy202"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
