Each weapon has their own unique moveset, statistics and rarity, with rarer weapons spawning less frequently but often being more effective against your enemies.</p>\n<p>A three minute round-time will encourage quick, chaotic and violent action, such as that frequently seen fighting games and arena fighters (Smash Bros and Stick Fight: The Game for example). Alongside the combat, map hazards and terrain, spectators will be able to change the conditions on the map through a voting system. This will allow for terrain modifications, weapon spawns, changes to physics and other things to alter the experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T06:27:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/661/66108442e85b336ce9f39ad3e697e513.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SAEByron2019-2T"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
