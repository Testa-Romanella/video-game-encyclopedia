Obstacles set on fire suffer from afterburn and take additional damage over time, allowing the pyromaniac to excel at hit-and-run tactics. <br/><br/><strong>Mr. Arsonist says:</strong><br/>\"As you walk, a fuse trails behind you, burning, setting fire to pools of gasoline from tanks you've tipped over as you went to the exit, laughing as you go. Unfortunately, the fuse burns rather quickly, and having it catch up to you, or brushing up against one of the flaming walls, or being engulfed in the fireballs resulting from the flames reaching the gas tanks, is extremely unhealthy to say the least.\"<br/><br/>Starting off in the bank building, you move on to the other locations, all the way through the city, occasionally meeting interesting puzzles on the way. <br/>Master pyromaniacs get to play the secret missions. Great fun!<br/><br/>NOTICE: Playing requires good perception, strategic planning and recognizing schemes.<br/>Various levels that require not only creative thinking, but also good reflexes and strict interaction with objects are the core elements of gameplay. <br/><br/>P. S. The realistic physics engine is included!<br/>********************************************************************************<br/>Now we wish to find a community and to share builds (with new levels and mechanics) to collect the feedback and wishes for next improvements.<br/><br/>Thanks!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad6/ad6323d4a78373b24a9d2c7952e1cd58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EvilCoGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["EvilCoGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
