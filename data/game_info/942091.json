YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN</em></p>\n<p>Mudborne is a laid-back nature sim game about breeding &amp; collecting frogs!\u00a0Visited in your dreams by a mysterious deity, you begin a journey to help rediscover Her lost children.</p>\n<ul><li>Finally reach your life goals and become an actual frog!</li><li>TINY LITTLE FROGS YOU CAN CATCH AND CHASE<br/>\n</li><li>Find and collect different mushrooms to help buff (or debuff) your frogs</li><li>Play god and manipulate your frogs genetics to create new species</li><li>One of the frogs has a tiny hat!!! GOTY contender????</li></ul>\n<p>Mudborne spawned as a small week-long gamejam, #FletchFest, organised by FletchMakes! The result is the game you can play here,\u00a0with music by\u00a0Mothense. :D<br/></p>\n<p>I've always joked about making \"APICO but frog\", but it's never been much more than that - with the gamejam theme of \"pond\" however it seemed like a good opportunity to make it a reality!</p>\n<p>With Mudborne I wanted to play more with the idea of direct manipulation &amp; min/max-ing of genetics to find new species (rather than just slapping bees together), as well as some more interesting nature mechanics - while still bringing the same menu management &amp; crafting minigame vibes you all know and love (along with all the learning I've had making APICO!)</p>\n<p>I've got lots of ideas for this concept and would love to turn this into a more fleshed out demo and maybe even a full game if people are interested, so if you are maybe give it a lil wishlist??</p>\n<p>If you want to follow along with the project you can catch me on Twitter, or hit up the TNgineers Discord</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T13:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/916/916c91acfd915ae49b6d694e1680e6ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TNgineers"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
