That sounds made up.</strong></p>\n<p>It is! In it's simplest terms, it's just a bundle of games (common thing) packaged with a zine (also common thing) about the aforementioned games.\u00a0And they're all packaged together in a convenient little zipped folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Now back to where we started.</strong></p>\n<p>Each month will feature games by 10 different developers.\u00a0 Each issue I hope to bring together games that explore the breadth of what our art form has to offer in hopes of one day reaching people who would otherwise not give games a second thought.</p>\n<p>Games as whole are a relatively young medium, but far more importantly one dominated by stories of extreme success. There is little attention given to the independent and 'small press' of games outside of the those year's mega-hits. One of the big problems is the people who would cover these games almost exclusively, are just as small (if not smaller) than the people making them. This lack of coverage leads to 5+ years projects that, to the public, launch surprisingly.</p>\n<p>The entire culture leads to impossible expectations of what a small team (or single person) can create and the overall devaluation of 'smaller' games. It is my goal with this anthology to change that culture to better appreciate these games and the developers who make them.</p>\n<p>Because 10 games is a lot of game (and data) the anthology has split into two separate zip files. Don't forget to download them both.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Saccharine Playground (WIN) -\u00a0Adrien Dittrick\u00a0and June Flower<br/>EMBRACE (WIN/MAC/Linux) -\u00a0R\u00e9my Devaux<br/>Flux (WIN/MAC) - Mars Ashton<br/>Match me if you can\u00a0(WIN/MAC/Android) -\u00a0\u00a0Florence No\u00e9,\u00a0Karine Houbrix,\u00a0\u00a0Mathilde Herard,\u00a0Tristan Itier,\u00a0Edward, Pierre Corbinais<br/>Therapy for Orchestra Movement III (WIN) -\u00a0lucasograssi<br/>I Have Low Stats But My Class Is \"Leader\", So I Recruited Everyone I Know To Fight The Dark Lord (WIN/MAC) -\u00a0Damien Crawford<br/>let your egg people grow into large trees (WIN/MAC), two of swords (WIN/MAC) - willow<br/>CONURBANATION (WIN) - Caique Assis<br/>The List (WIN/WINE) - Nikki Bee\u00a0<br/>TV Night (WIN/MAC/Linux) -\u00a0Cynthia Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00ednez, David Rodr\u00edguez Madri\u00f1\u00e1n, Perfecto Antonio Carballo Oliveira, Lara Calo Alonso</p>\n<p>Cover - Ana Critchfield</p>\n<p>Also, and this part is very important to me and should truly be taken as given, each developer (and the cover artist) are paid for their submissions and developers are paid royalties on all future sales.</p>\n<p>Interested in the Indiepocalypse being delivered straight to you every month?
