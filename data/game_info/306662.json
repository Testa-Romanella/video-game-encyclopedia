You play as a little demon named after the purple glowing Terraria ore, who's been tasked to hold the hordes of heaven all by himself!<br/></p>\n<p>Burn those annoying shining beings with your powerful fireballs that you can shoot with the \"Space Bar\"! Avoid all those lightning bolts by moving with the \"a\" and \"d\" keys; and jump with \"w\" so you don't die to the angels that have landed!<br/></p>\n<p>\"But wait!\" I hear you say, \"what do I do if an angel gets to the ground and start shooting the hell out of me?\" Well, worry not! The answer is simple! Just walk up to their possition and shoot them; they will regret landing in the first place!</p>\n<p>Instructions: Move sideways with \"a\" and \"d\". Jump with \"w\", shoot with \"Space Bar\" and pause the game with \"p\".</p><p>OpenGL 3.3 or higher is required.<br/></p>\n<p>Instrucciones: Mu\u00e9vete a los lados con \"a\" y \"d\".
