It followed the game jam's theme of \"An end is a new beginning\". Therefore, in\u00a0<em>pollen</em> you shoot pollen out of full-grown dandelions, to create new plants. Dandelions show their beauty and afterwards they transform to create new beginnings.</p>\n\n\n<p>To play Pollen, load the game in your browser. There are 2 modes; normal and hard. Both play the same; to win in normal you need to collect all flower colors. In hard you need to have all flower colors in your field.</p>\n<p>To create colors; plant your flower close to a\u00a0<em>starflower</em>\u00a0and watch the colors merge. White flowers reset the color of your flower; so you can get all primary colors as well!</p>\n\n\n<p>This game was made by Ballonplantsoen. All sprites and scripts are made by themselves. Music is made by\u00a0Wampino\u00a0and is literally called\u00a0<em>Magical forest thingy</em>. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T15:46:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ac/2aca42eab8eaa44ba497dc9f3d179da0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ballon Plantsoen"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
