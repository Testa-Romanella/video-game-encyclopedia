The demo is expected to be patched with fixes and content, so players who use the itch.io app can automatically download updates when they go live.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Schrodinger's Catgirl</strong> is a point-and-click sci-fi mystery visual novel from the studio that brought you Retrace: Memories of Death. Follow the adventures of the investigation duo, Lemi and Leon, when they stumble upon the assault of a young woman in an abandoned mansion. The team decides to investigate the incident themselves before the police get to the scene, but the more they look, the more the truth changes\u2026<br/><br/><strong>IS THE GIRL IN THE MANOR ALIVE OR DEAD?</strong><br/></p>\r\nINVESTIGATE\r\n<p>Schrodinger's Catgirl takes inspiration from other adventure and point and click games, such as the Ace Attorney series and Until Dawn. Explore different rooms and floors in the manor with Lemi and Leon, finding more clues and evidence to build your case. Who really attacked that girl, and why was the manor abandoned in the first place?<br/>A very complex web of variables determines the truth behind the attack, depending on what evidence you discover. In the event you don't like how the outcome looks, there may be someone in the shadows willing to wipe them away ...<br/></p>\r\nEXPLORE\r\n<p>There's more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to solve a mystery. Use Lemi's camera to switch between the manor's past and present and find new angles on the truth, or even discover areas inaccessible in the present day. But be careful - danger lurks in the depth of the manor, and the more time distorts, the more likely that Lemi and Leon will find their lives in peril.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T22:34:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6ee66f2d3c86d534656b6fcd9adef2af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spider Lily Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
