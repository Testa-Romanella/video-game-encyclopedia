I plan to continue work on the project and release steady updates adding sound, additional levels, and a combat system overhaul. I have programmed the game from scratch so these updates will come slowly. This is just a very early proof of concept, thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d86fbeeac414094517e41bdf534c9f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["APotatoButSideways"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
