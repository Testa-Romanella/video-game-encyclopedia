Each room presents the player with a choice, and based on that choice the player may gain or lose a variable called \"karma.\" After three rooms, the game checks how much karma the player has, and depending the number gives a different ending. The reason I\u00a0chose this structure is because it illustrates that the player's choices hold weight; something that ought to be apparent from the tombstone that may be found in the second room depending on a previous choice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T09:50:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f86/f86a6fda3fb2576ebdd170f7e064040c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mendeza6"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
