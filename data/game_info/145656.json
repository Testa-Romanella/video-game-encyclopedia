Hackathon in which I made this game in 24 hours. During this time, I made Jumpguy, a platformer using raycasts from each corner of the player's sprite, which ended up controlling a lot like Super Meat Boy, one of my all-time favorites.</p>\n<p>Since the jam is now over, and I already presented my game to the participants, I decided to give out copies of the game. Attached are downloads for a build for Windows 64 bit, and Mac 86x.\u00a0</p>\n<p>X-Box controller support is available, but tutorials for it are not in-game, although there are only two buttons to figure out (hint: it's A to jump, Y to reset, left stick to move).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/519/519855129e7aff852728d44f4980758c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Okay Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
