Or maybe not.  <br/><br/><br/>The map at the beginning of Mango Mischief, showing off the early areas of the game<br/><br/><strong>Mango Mischief</strong> attempts to straddle the line between paying homage to the tried-and-true tropes of JRPGs, while also parodying the memes of role-playing games with plot twists and comedy. <br/><br/>Self-referential humor and fourth wall breaks augment the narrative and interactions in  this game, without detracting from the core gameplay: <br/><br/>- Open exploration of a huge, diverse world, full of quests and monsters and loot <br/>- Flexibility in leveling up desired classes and gaining new abilities along the way <br/>- The freedom to optimize character builds and complete dungeons in any order <br/>- Tons of weapons, armor, accessories, and items that allow for a variety of playstyles <br/>- A turn-based battle system involving elemental strengths and weaknesses, an assortment of buffs, debuffs, and status ailments, and monsters that scale with your progress, to keep battles fresh, interesting, and challenging<br/>- Just enough random encounters to annoy players who prefer visible encounters, and just enough visible encounters to annoy players who prefer random encounters<br/>- At least a few interesting NPCs who aren't merely mindless drones created for the sole purpose of furthering the plot of your special story <br/><br/>Please enjoy <strong>Mango Mischief</strong>, the passion project of a solo indie game developer!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T04:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ce/3ce9fe46cda6411d66c516f9dc514f60.jpg", "website": "https://www.mangomischief.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acute Mango"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Acute Mango"], "esrb_rating": null}
