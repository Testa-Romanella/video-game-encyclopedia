The Gallery contains over 20 years of visual content by one surreal, expressionist psychedelic Canadian artist, making his last stand before AI Art wipes us all off the map; inspired by everything from the peak era of 80s and 90s comic book art, independent classical animation, and rock n roll to the Renaissance men, Cave Paintings and psychedelia; laid out in a stimulating environment, designed to relax your senses and massage your brain. The goal was to create a virtual art gallery, to circumvent the costs and taxes of a physical gallery, and the censorship of social media; which can run on most any PC, and to also produce a video game that is fun to move around inside of and experience as the player. The secondary goal with A Fool's Art Gallery is to fund the development of future titles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are a flying magical mask who s*!*s stars; be sure to look for secret doors to reveal hidden content as you explore the gallery at large, which contains an insane amount of content to consume. With future updates the contents of the content will be constantly expanded upon. One ticket, for a life time of access. No paid DLCs, no subscriptions. Galleries include 3 self published books, a handful of short story comics, hundreds of paintings, hundreds of pen and ink drawings, hundreds of digital drawings; carvings, masks, boats, alters dedicated to my cat The Amazing Mister Number Eight, and hand animated NPCs, all acting as a map of the psychomagical journey that is a human life. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith new art update roll outs, some NPCs and assets from future game releases by Reflection Frequency will make appearances and be added to A Fool's Art Gallery, keeping the roster fresh and ever expanding, creating a semi cohesive Universe of titles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd finally; being crafted with our Lord and Saviour, the GZDOOM Engine; A Fool's Art Gallery is wide open to modification and custom level designs. with the GZDOOM Engine, you can access the core files, extract the art images themselves, and print them off to your heart's content.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n-4 levels packed to the brim with hundreds of works of art.<br/>\r\n-Cats.<br/>\r\n-100% original content.<br/>\r\n-Secret rooms and areas.<br/>\r\n-Items to find.<br/>\r\n-Content previews of future game releases.<br/>\r\n-Weird paintings.<br/>\r\n-Strange drawings.<br/>\r\n-Possibly a cult?<br/>\r\n-Hand drawn animation.<br/>\r\n-Some items to pick up and find that don't actually do anything yet.<br/>\r\n-It's pretty giant.<br/>\r\n-Free future updates, forever, or until I die, whichever comes first.<br/>\r\n-Not nearly as many game breaking glitches and bugs as most AAA titles.
