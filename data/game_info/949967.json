Team iNtuition values the notion of educating people on complex topics in intuitive ways through technology. (Also, I enjoy magic but feel most games do it a disservice by treating it like another type of gun, at best).<br/><br/></li><li> As part of Team iNtution, I am lead developer, tech artist &amp; founder. I do tasks ranging from 3D Modeling, rigging, animating, texture editing, design, story and narrative. I do a bit of audio and music, but mostly focus on the major features requisite of a vertical-slice styled prototype \u2013 animated models, environment, VFX and programming.<br/><br/></li><li>Your support will aid in polishing &amp; continuing to develop this project, increasing social outreach, creating community and building an audience whose feedback will directly help improve this video game. Lastly, it will tell our future team that there are others who believe in and support this work, validating continued efforts on the journey so far.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T06:34:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/309/309a53bd71c25303819a7ce980bd61c0.jpg", "website": "https://goteamintuition.com/qredux.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 350, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team iNtuition"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team iNtuition"], "esrb_rating": null}
