The screen two above the start screen is glitched so you can never leave it, and certain things that I intended to exist do not. I hope you can enjoy this for what it is. I do not expect to win. I made a game. I'm happy with that. Enjoy it for what it is, but please don't condemn it for what it isn't. I tried my hardest.\u00a0<br/>PS: Making a metroidvania probably wasn't smart.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T11:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9b/e9b56938150e689ce0e640e0b354f471.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Crazypenguin Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
