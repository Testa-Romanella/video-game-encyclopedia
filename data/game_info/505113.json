He's a pro snowboarder, so you should be able to learn a trick or two from him. Along the way, you'll meet a bunch of poorly designed characters who happen to look like stick figures.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your goal of the game is to collect 7 sets of boots, since Gifter's out of stock when you enter the academy. Along the way, Gifter may also want to play a round of \"tag\" with you. So grab a board and have a great time!</p>\n<p><em>Because this academy is absolutely fun.</em><br/></p>\r\nCURRENT STATE OF MOD\r\n<p>This page contains the PRE-RELEASE version of the mod. That means I haven't added or tweaked everything yet. Any existing changes or additions are, of course, subject to change. The official mod should take up to a month to complete.</p>\r\nExclusive pre-release package!\r\n<p>If you get a pre-release version of the game, the folder will include an exclusive 3D character called \"Creepy Mick\" that I did! The sprite isn't within any of my mods, and he also won't be in the final build's folder for the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>ENJOY THE MOD!</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T02:58:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/379/379ce3bdc8fd4920c4dbab8064d89711.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harold"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
