The environment is inspired by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, which was the pinnacle of architectural achievement during the medieval era of India.<br />\nThis inspired us and thus the art style naturally went down a route of hand painting each and every texture, which can be reflected in every pixel of the game. All thanks to our environment artist, since she comes with a Fine Art background and special expertise that suits the game.<br />\n\u200b</p>\n<p>Unique Character Artstyle<br />\nReflecting Southeast Asia in an Indian game</p>\n<p>Our character art style reflects inspiration from Southeast Asia, the art team went to Bali, Indonesia to study more about the mythology and the background of the island. The art team were heavily influenced by the demonic statues and sculptures that were later infused within the characters of the game.<br />\n\u200b<br />\nA Story Of Siblings<br />\nA sister on a rescue mission, against all odds</p>\n<p>Raji: An Ancient Epic takes you through an intense and emotional story of Raji, who is determined to find her brother and bring peace to the human realm.

The levels will also feature secret locations where one might wonder, what would they stumble upon..friend or foe, treasure or trap?</p>\n<p>Each of the handcrafted levels will ask the player to surpass challenges one after another. Various \u201cMandala\u201d puzzles play an important role in environment storytelling, these were designed to give the player a breather in-between the challenging combat.
