I had made one before as a gift, but I really only did the art and very minor tweaks, while someone else did the visual scripting for me (I didn't know what I was doing back then LOL). So, I'm counting this as my official first (public) game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you like it! It's nowhere near perfect and I have a lot to work on, but I'm still very proud that I made a finished product ^_^</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Instagram:\u00a0@mental.bloxx<br/>Ko-Fi:\u00a0mental.bloxx<br/></p>\n<p>**Cover image by Jeshiro Greens.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T12:08:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea5/ea574691060096fa7b78d2d307ff46dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mental.bloxx"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
