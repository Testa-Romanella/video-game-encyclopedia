These levels are VERY easy on problem solving, but can be otherwise complicated from the start. After mechanics are introduced, more and more complicated solutions will be required to advance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The UI system still needs a lot of work. One key issue is the map blocking UI elements due to an outdated setup where I based the UI on camera instead of the overlay.</p>\n<p>A new 3D player model is in the works, and will be integrated into a later build.</p>\n<p>Please direct all feedback to the discord, twitter, and anywhere else you think I'll see it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!
