Blocks at the top of the screen will fall down and increasingly gain strength. While you can level up and gain a stronger ball, you have another resource with time travel which is gained through clearing blocks. When time traveling, the map will reset to the stated time but you will also run into your past self, if you are hit by your other self's ball you will get a game over also but if they get hit by your ball they will be defeated.</p>\n<p>Movement - Arrow Keys (Right and Left)</p>\n<p>Time Travel (When Reality Bending Bar is full) - Spacebar</p>\n<p>Selecting a time - Backspace</p>\n\n<p>(Audio and music is present but requires you to click the page for it to run, if the music isn't playing you may have to reload the page)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T06:24:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/244/24490b7b20ba5712f0fe12a0b1f01e12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Finality Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
