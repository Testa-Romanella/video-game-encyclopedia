I actually had a lot finished but wasn't really happy about the result and canceled it. Later on I started from scratch with the same idea but with a new art style and better system. The game has 3 stages for now but a lot more are coming soon!<br/></p><p>The game is about a boy who lives in a peaceful medieval town. He lives in a magical world filled with might and magic. Everyone lives at peace together until a mysterious wizard appears. The wizard corrupts everyone in the land and turns them evil. Their eyes turn white like snow and the land turns to darkness. But for some reason the boy didn't get affected by the spell. The faith of his land is in his hands. He must gather all the 8 bits of the long ago shattered legendary bitsword to slay the wizard and turn everyone back to normal.<br/></p><p>The game works with a xbox360 controller and keyboard. For keyboard X to attack and C to dash, and for controller X to attack and RB to dash.<br/> </p>  Please note that the game cuts off after passing the spike gate.<br/> <p>Project updates can be find on my dev page: https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/the-8-bits-hacknslash-adventure-game.1987/#post-17750</p> If for any reason you would like to seek contact with me, send me an email to: hedgefoggames@outlook.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d69/d69595eecfdec2c51d801329238ee891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tobias Brugel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
