Urtuk is the name of main character. His story begins when he escaped from the Senatorium, a place where medical experiments take place on common people.<br/><br/>Urtuk has suffered a mortal disease, a mutation in the Senatorium. With every day, his health condition worsenes.. Now he searches for a cure in the world. It's only a matter of time, when his mutation evolves to a level, when he finally dies.<br/><br/>The world is set into dark, grimy theme. There are no classic fantasy beings like elfs, dwarfs or dragons, nor powerful magic, although there are some light magical features involved.<br/><br/>Many centuries ago, there were powerful Giants roaming the world. They lived peacefully with humans until a war between Man and Giant began.<br/><br/>Now the Giants are extinct. Some years ago, few librarians studied the bones and remains of ancient Giants. They did experiments and found out, they can extract a mystical fluid from their remains - Life Essense. With this, they could add many beneficial elements into human body. Not yet known, what exact impact this fluid on a human has, the experiments continue.. Very often, instead of improving the health condition of the targe, an opposite effect would take place, inflicting a mutation or lethal disease. This was the case of Urtuk.<br/><br/>If you like a more direct communication with us, please join our Discord  server.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-26T21:23:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22ebde63a1d1f1f505292f908d0e8d2e.jpg", "website": "http://www.urtuk.com", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 106, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 499, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["madsheepstudios", "David Kaleta"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["David Kaleta"], "esrb_rating": null}
