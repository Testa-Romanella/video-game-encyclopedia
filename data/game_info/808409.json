Find the enemy fleet.\u00a0 Stay hidden.\u00a0 Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T17:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbf/fbf2cdca15dbc15dd0b2bda9c083b15c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["africacrossgames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
