What was a monument to the gods is now a twisted place of ruin and despair, ruled by the tyrannical Usurper. He and his spawn ravage and plunder whatever they can reach, emboldened by the Tower's powers.<br/><br/>So many have tried to conquer the Tower. Brave warriors on their heroic quests; robbers, on a hunt for treasures and artifacts; even foreign kings with their armies... Most of them had perished and others now serve the Usurper instead, of their own free will or otherwise.<br/><br/>Yet, we believe... We still believe that someone, one day, will be able to set our souls free.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Grave Tower</strong> is a \"rogue-lite\" tactical RPG. Choose your adventurer, climb the tower and fight off monsters while building your team. <br/><br/><ul><li> Recruit defeated enemies or sacrifice them for their abilities. <br/></li><li> Replayability. No single run is the same. Encounters with enemies, random events and recruiting opportunities are different each time.<br/></li><li> Deep tactical combat. Fights in the Tower are tough and brutal.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T02:12:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50e/50e2af9cd0b9e7f92c27b8f6de8d26cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sergei C."], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Sergei C."], "esrb_rating": null}
