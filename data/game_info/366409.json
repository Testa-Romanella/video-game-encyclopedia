After the plant is maximize, it will automatically generate a new fruit/vegetable depending on its kind. And then, it will be replaced by a new plant when all of the remaining slots are filled.</p>\n<p>During night time, you also need to type and every correct type will summon a sword depending on its combo count. The higher the combo, the higher damage to the monster. The monster will steal your harvest in all different plants in every attack. So better kill that monster to prevent it from stealing.</p>\n<p>After 5 days straight harvest-battle scenes, in case you finished the game (I hope so), you'll be hailed for being the great Farm Type Hero!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T04:27:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee8/ee854533f2294670d8ab6c0f24e8f283.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["lpancho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
