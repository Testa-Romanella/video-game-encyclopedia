It has a <strong>custom spell building system</strong> that allows players create unique attacks. The game has a high focus on gameplay customizability and has a high skill ceiling.<h3>Custom Spells</h3><br/>Central to Nurose is the unique spell building system. Spells are built by visually programming glyphs in a staff. There are 30+ glyphs ranging from simple movement glyphs to complex conditional glyphs. You don't need to level up to earn new glyphs or staffs. Each glyph is available from the start so everyone is on a even playing field. <br/><br/>The possibilities of this are endless. Some spells that you could make include:<br/><ul><li> Mines that explodes when the enemy is near.<br/></li><li> A shield made up of projectiles in a semi circle.<br/></li><li> Anti-missile attack that will look for enemy projectiles and destroy them.<br/></li><li> Spell that makes decoy clones and moves them in specific directions. </li></ul><br/>What sets the great players apart are their skill in spell building and mastering their builds. When you have made a build, enter online matchmaking and fight others with your spells.<h3>Online matchmaking</h3><br/>In online matchmaking you will fight others in a 1v1 best of 5 game. Each player has several staffs available. The game is made in a custom engine with rollback netcode for optimal online experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T15:46:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/766/766b2d5c743d0cdca936d5d1e297aff5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["orongto"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Orongto"], "esrb_rating": null}
