Develop and deploy exploits to hack devices in order to unlock even more \u201cdata\u201d.  What else is the Cyber good for? A good laugh, actually. <br/><br/>You may get deleted from the Cyber if you\u2019re not careful, but why so serious about it? Lighten up a bit, and enjoy a bit of comedy along the way. This isn\u2019t a downtrodden future full of sad panda themes. But it certainly is a bit kinky, putting it mildly. <br/><br/>Acquire over 350 CG images (mostly of deviant acts you won't be able to describe publicly) - at a relatively rapid rate without any grinding, leveling systems or similar barriers to your adventure. Use clues from magazines, emails and other digital files to find passwords for computers that are storing the devious and delightful \"data\".<br/><br/>You can play the game with just your mouse (or similar HID), allowing for the ultimate casual coomer experience.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>All characters are 18 years or older.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T02:40:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d6831b20d099aab78a12cb5e584ed140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 518, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LarsMidnatt"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Witching Hour Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
