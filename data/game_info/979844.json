{"id": 979844, "slug": "asteroidtd", "name": "AsteroidTD", "name_original": "AsteroidTD", "description": "AsteroidTD is a game in a redesigned tower defense style. Now there is no fixed field or one path, the whole endless space is at your disposal to build it up with your buildings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are only 4 types of buildings available to you (to capture an asteroid, to protect it, to mine gold, and to conduct research), but their strategic use expands significantly when the research tree comes into play with 161 sub-items and 18 types of asteroids that affect the buildings created on them. Strengthen your defense or boost your economy, expand your influence as far as possible, or create a compact but impregnable fortress - the decisions are yours alone.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will fight against various enemies attacking from all sides. Unlike many games of the genre, you will not defend a static base, but a small spaceship flying independently on the battlefield, building new buildings or providing support. And here you can lose your towers, first of all the enemies will pay attention to them, and then to the builder spinning nearby, so do not forget to equip asteroids with a decent number of turrets.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can chase records and competing with friends, or you can just relax to the calm ambient background music. Everyone will find something of their own. Create your own colony in this cold space.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T10:10:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c74/c746625aa341fbfb83424de6cdaa656e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oleg Kobzarev"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Oleg Kobzarev"], "esrb_rating": null}
