{"id": 93186, "slug": "starship-command-2", "name": "Starship Command 2", "name_original": "Starship Command 2", "description": "<p>\n<em>Starship Command 2</em> is a much-expanded (and currently in alpha) sequel to <em>Starship Command,</em> a persistent-world, massively single-player, real-time tactical starship simulator wrapped in an AI-driven 4X game. Starting with a lowly shuttle, you will trade and battle your way to victory, amassing a gigantic fleet customized to your liking!\r\n</p>\n<strong>What Is Meant by <em>Massively Single-Player?</em></strong>\n<p>\n<em>Massively Single-Player</em> means when you start <em>Starship Command 2</em> the first time, it will generate a galaxy with thousands of sectors, each with their own planets and economies. Then populate the galaxy with AI-controlled empires that will attempt to conquer every sector. The galaxy persists through every captain you play as. And you can swap between multiple captains and play both sides of a conflict.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe empires will create wars and alliances with other empires, and even break out in civil wars.\r\n</p>\n<strong>But What Do I Do?</strong>\n<p>\r\n\tTake command of a starship! (or a fleet of starships). Build a fortune by trading commodities, completing missions, collecting taxes from sectors and battle the other empires for glory!\r\n</p>\n<strong>Features:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Hundreds of empires (hand-crafted and computer generated) to play.</li>\n<li>Thousands of sectors to colonize, trade with or attack.</li>\n<li>Automated captain's log generation will note actions taken by you and later save the entire log to a file.</li>\n<li>Persistent galaxy that stays through all captains you play as.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>What is Currently Working:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Galaxy generation - All galaxies are based on moddable JSON files.</li>\n<li>Moddability - In fact, all files are either JSON or PNG, making the game mod-friendly!</li>\n<li>Empire AI - All empires will act &amp; react to other empires, creating a dynamic galaxy that can span thousands of years.</li>\n<li>Economy - Trading commodities between sectors and colonizing sectors.</li>\n<li>Captain's Log - Working, but still needs polishing as more features are added to <em>Starship Command 2.</em></li><li>Randomly-created ship hulls and components</li><li>Massive real-time, tactical, space battles - Possibly hundreds of ships battling, while balancing power usage, shield sections, weapon and shield frequencies, etc.</li><li>Ship-boarding and capture - Beam aboard enemy ships and capture or sabotage while the battle rages on around you.</li><li>Job boards - Standard jobs, such as take me here, bring this here.</li><li>Space Monsters - A large apocalyptic cigar? A disembodied translucent-colored hand? A giant space amoeba? Space squids? Who knows!</li><li>\n</li></ul>\n<strong>What is Planned:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>More Job boards and scenarios - Scenarios such as moral dilemmas, logic problems, nemesis-battles, space-monsters, empire super-weapons, etc.</li>\n<li>Planet exploration - Beam down to a planet and explore the terrain, people and animals.</li></ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74c31ce1d8dc4271a3de9aab003a767f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["evgLabs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
