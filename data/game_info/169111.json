It's a small game, but it took six months of my life and many late nights. Maybe throw me some money for it?</p><p>transmissions is a series of scenes from the Abiverse, little snippets of my life related to video games or video game spaces. My thesis paper deals with bridging the gap between my lived experience as a player of video games and my academic research in the area of video games, identity, and embodiment. Games are pretty uniquely placed to tell people's stories, and tools like Twine enable just about anyone to tell their story in a gamified format. Because of the concept of embodiment (the player identifies with the protagonist of a game), games are often better equipped to tell these stories. To demonstrate my point (and to discuss my own life in a highly autobiographical thesis project), I created transmissions to showcase this embodying quality of games.</p><p>My due date has passed, and I am aware that there is a slight glitch in the game - the hub will double the number of times you've been there. I am searching for the time to fix this, and will post an update when I've tweaked it. My apologies!</p><p>It's pretty short - it should only take you about 40 minutes to play. I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68e/68ee1114372825e269179fc09f0422b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abi J"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
