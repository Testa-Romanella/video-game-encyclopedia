It has 3 levels and a boss. The real challenge is to see how many bullets you spend the game with and in what time. Developed years ago for a fair with my friend Arturo, it has now returned, intact so that the experience of the past is not lost.</p>\n<p>Controls: Move with the arrows and shoot with the spacebar.
