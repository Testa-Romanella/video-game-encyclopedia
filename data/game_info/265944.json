The silver\u00a0pellets are intended to be use to destroy the mines and double your points on the ice blocks.\u00a0 Enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2f/b2f34e39a4a32014d1191210eb2870e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ponsuax"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
