On Judgement Day the Dead begun their hunt against mankind. <br/><br/>It is the year 1954, the world has become a pile of crumbles, where the few survivors try resist the hunger of the Dead. Few nations, held by cruel dictatorships, are left intact. <br/><br/>The darkest future that mankind could imagine turned into the most monstrous reality. This is the world of Sine Requie. <br/>What was once a country named Italy, today is the Sanctum Imperium, a firm theocracy ruled by Pope Leo XIV. <br/><br/>The Roman Church took absolute power, turning these lands into an anachronistic place, where armoured Templars and horse-mounted Inquisitors parade the streets side-by-side with cars. <br/><br/>Here the population lives left behind, immersed in obscurantism, hidden within the walls of their fortified towns. In the hope of surviving the grasp of the Dead, societies manically persecute the heretics, who are considered the emissaries of the Devil, sent among us to defeat the Justs in the day of the Apocalypse.Game Features<ul><li> A story full of plot twists<br/>Lead an inquisitorial team in their hunt against an heretical cult, racing against the clock. Your choices will change the story and the lives of those you will meet.  <br/>Each chapter boasts more than seven different endings: how will you use the power you hold? Will you be able to stop the mysterious demonic ritual threatening the Imperium's order?
