Collect and gather elements form compounds and molecules and battle your way through a dystopian future.   </p>\n<p>In this game you will learn some chemistry concepts and develop/deepen your knowledge of the periodic table. Perfect for light-hearted study and/or just hack and slash your way to victory. <br/></p>\n\r\nWhat will you learn?\r\n\r\n<p>This game also has a fully functioning quiz battle system that tests the types of the periodic table, the elements abbreviations, and a bonus quiz for testing the abbreviations that do not contain the letters of the element. There is also a quiz machine on the top floor of the mall.\r\n</p>\n<p>This will consolidate your learning.  </p>\n<p>Additionally, you can synthesise compounds using elements in their correct molecular structure.  </p>\n<p>There are also abilities based on chemistry concepts and questing missions on Haber Bosch and Madam Curie.  </p>\n<p>For example, you can form citric acid to heal and hydrofluoric acid to attack metal types. And you can synthesise adrenalin using the established molecular structure. </p>\n<p>In this game you will learn some chemistry concepts and develop/deepen your knowledge of the periodic table. Perfect for light-hearted study and/or just hack and slash your way to victory. </p>\r\nFuture Plans\r\n<p>\u00a0  </p>\n<p>To increase the current 100 common compounds to 200 common compounds and create more gathering and synthesis quests pertaining to that.   </p>\n<p>To create an atomic number quiz for a machine not a quiz battle as it would be too difficult.  </p>\n<p>To develop bonus quests: using chemistry concepts. </p>\r\nGame Duration and Thanks\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks and I hope you enjoy this game the play time is infinite although completion time is around several hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43fcab411be5792f549cdd32a5b2c2c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JBo"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
