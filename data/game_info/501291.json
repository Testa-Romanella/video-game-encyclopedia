You and your friends attempt to rearrange a room before time runs out by occasionally looking at a polaroid of the room's initial setup for guidance. This was a really, really fun prototype to make, and my focus this week was to make an experience that was hectic and collaborative.\u00a0By collaborative, what I\u00a0mean is that any number of people can <em>\"play\"</em> - join in the communication of <em>\"rotate the clock more!\"</em>\u00a0- and the more people who actually play - utilize Zoom's remote control - the more hectic and fun the game is for everyone!</p>\n<strong>Space</strong>Start the game / View polaroid<strong>Left-Click</strong>Move objects around room / Select Tooltip option<strong>Right-Click</strong>Open an object's Tooltip<strong>X</strong>Close Tooltip<strong>M</strong>Mute<strong>R</strong>Restart game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c8/8c8ef22901907fb9cee5303a38a7761b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
