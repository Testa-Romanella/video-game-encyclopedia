Very early work, but shows some complex-ish systems. This will all created and setup within 1 week, so extremely buggy and very rough/non-polished. Metroidvania style.<br/></p>\n<p>3 levels, including a boss level. <br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Controls:</em><br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement<br/>L.Shift - Dash<br/>Space - Jump<br/>ESC - Pause/Menu<br/>J - Shoot<br/>K - Missile<br/>L - Shoot Grapple Hook<br/>M - Charge Energy</p>\n<p>Hold W to shoot diagonally up or D to shoot diagonally down. Double jump is very buggy. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Things I would improve if I worked on this project again:<br/>- Fix double jump<br/>- create more respawn points for the spiked areas<br/>- Resize character to fit the size of the game a bit better<br/>- add audio effect for death<br/>- Overhaul the boss fight to telegraph attacks <br/>- Create a better UI system<br/>- Create a small story and cutscene system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think about it!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T09:39:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d2/1d2387289e19337393907d14b34bd11a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aetius"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
