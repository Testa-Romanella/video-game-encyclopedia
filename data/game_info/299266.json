The focus was \"sense experience\" and the theme was \"sugar\".</p>\n<p>In this game the player follows the journey of an Irish immigrant arriving in Greenock, Scotland, in 1865, trying to find his luck working in a sugar refinery. There he must learn the refining process, activating machines in the correct order each day. However, he is losing his sight rapidly, and must transfer his reliance on sight to a reliance on sound, all by listening to the Melody of Machines.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Celina Brylczak-Sztanka\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Harry Dub</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Luc Deligne</strong></p>\n<p>Sounds from\u00a0https://freesound.org/</p>\n<p>Game made with GameMaker;Studio v1.4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:51:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/184/184ab9bdc75e075ed2108cdbf733a23a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LucDeligne"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
