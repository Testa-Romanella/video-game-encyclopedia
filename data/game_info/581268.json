Enemy units become visible in proximity of one square around friendly units or within a striking move. Only the first unit under direct threat is shown. This adds a great amount of unpredictability and a scouting aspect to the game. Makes it exceptionally tactical.  <br/><br/>The goal of the game is not to checkmate the king, but to capture it. Failing to move the king out of check or moving him into check are legal moves.
