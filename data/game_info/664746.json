It has been ravaged by a succession of natural disasters, wiping out part of the population and making the Earth very hostile to others. You are two US Army soldiers on a surveillance patrol of a former military base, that has been buried under sand and where monsters have been spotted. During your rounds, an unfortunate event occurred: you fell into a cavity. Because of this fall, you find yourself separated from each other and thus must survive as long as possible ...\u00a0Will you be able to meet the challenge ?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme :</strong> \"There are two kinds of people : Those with loaded guns and those who dig.

So, to avoid running out of ammo, players can<strong> switch roles </strong>in two different ways : either by picking up the appropriate<strong> bonus</strong> in the arena or by <strong>shooting on their teammate</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is up to you to properly manage your ammunition and switch roles at the right time because the game ends when the digger is eaten by a monster.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Bonus</strong> (only\u00a0collectable to the digger)</p>\n<p>Bullets : Increase the bullets in your own inventory</p>\n<p>Switch : Players change their role.</p>\n<p>Speed up : The digger runs faster</p>\n<p>Double ammo : The bullets collected are doubled</p>\n<p>Dig up : Digger digs faster</p>\n<p>Big bullets: The size of the bullets fired is increased</p>\n\r\nControls :\u00a0PS4 or Xbox controller\r\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Designed by\u00a0:\u00a0Th\u00e9o POTTIER\u00a0- Marcus DO REGO\u00a0 - Xavier\u00a0DECOURT</p>\n<p>Developped by :\u00a0Mathieu PREVOT -\u00a0Lucas \u00a0GUICHARD -\u00a0Charlelie\u00a0GARRIGUES</p>\n<p>Graphics by :\u00a0Elora LOIGEROT -\u00a0Ines\u00a0OUHMANI</p>\n<p>Produced by :\u00a0IAQUINTA James\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:48:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a94/a941709c5808bdae71caba0c49de1b83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Theo Pottier"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
