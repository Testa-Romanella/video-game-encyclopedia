It still gives you several hours of fun and even more so if you like beating up your friends!<br/><br/>Discover the worlds of Yggdrasil as you and your teammates help the Gods in this co-op Action RPG where you use your powerful abilities to lay waste to the enemies of Valhalla. Level up and build your character with our advanced skill tree and powerful weapons.<h3>Co-op</h3><br/>Don't worry if you can't handle the boss alone. Just bring a friend or two along to keep the boss occupied while you stab him in the back. But make sure not to accidentally stab your friends while your at it!<h3>Dying</h3><br/>Death is not the end. Each try will get you and your team closer to your goal. You probably want to change tactics if you keep on dying though. Also, watch out for that friendly fire!<h3>Looting</h3><br/>Look for the loot to find a host of powerful weapons, and useful armor to protect you in battle. Or maybe collect as much valuable items you can carry to sell for traits and gear back at the shop.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T01:58:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff3769a1cd98796da1e578f58ca0787a.jpg", "website": "https://valhalla-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team S\u00e4mst"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Team S\u00e4mst"], "esrb_rating": null}
