However, in the depths of a forgotten isle the earth harbours a secret weapon\u2026 the mythical world tree Yggdrasil, which has the ability to convey its spirit to repopulate the earth\u2019s surface!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play as a forest spirit to plant forests of different type, limited only by the currency of sunlight (generated by the trees you have standing) -- but beware, as each season passes your trees will need to weather the corresponding elements.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS\u00a0\u00a0\ud83d\udc01</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf33 \u00a0PLANT A TREE\u00a0 - 1234 or click tree button, click destination\u00a0<br/>\u2728 CAST A SPELL\u00a0 - click planted tree (deselect tree first)<br/>\ud83d\udc97 HEAL YGGDRASIL -\u00a0click world tree\r\n<br/>\ud83c\udf0f\u00a0PAN MAP - right click +\u00a0drag</p>\n\n<p>HOW TO PLAY\u00a0\ud83d\udc4c</p>\n<p>This ruinous world is ruled by four deadly seasons -\u00a0the Burns, the Rains, the Frosts and the Famine \u2013 and a fifth Fair season that passes without event. Weather the four seasons and their elemental disasters (fast-spreading fire, escalating flood, killing frost and slow-damaging drought) by planting trees!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The more trees you plant, the more sunlight you will be able to use. But there\u2019s a catch: you also need sunlight to cast tree-specific spells to remove the effects of each disaster, and to heal the world tree if it comes under siege.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nurture saplings for a year and they\u2019ll mature into fully grown trees with higher defence, rewards and spell effect area. Each tree type counters a specific disaster, so be strategic in your planting choices!\u00a0</p>\n<p>TO WIN\u00a0\ud83d\udc51</p>\n<p>Fill the world with fully grown trees!
