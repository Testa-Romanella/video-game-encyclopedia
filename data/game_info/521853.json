Use z to apply your matrix, x to change indices, and the up/down arrow keys to adjust the value for that index. This is inspired by 3blue1brown's linear algebra videos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Transformation matrixes that shrink a graph onto a line or the origin point can get strange on the visualizer. Adjusting the numbers and hitting z should reset everything. This was made for practice, so if there's anything else that glitches let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:08:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/320a952f8036023d99f90195b3e73685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["paulanu"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
