Unfortunately we didn't have time to implement the additional units and maps planned and begun and this \"tutorial\" level is all there is for now! Additionally there's a known issue where the pinecone bomb projectiles don't display.  Might be fun to revisit one day! Thanks for playing! <br/></p>\n<p><em>Includes music by J.
