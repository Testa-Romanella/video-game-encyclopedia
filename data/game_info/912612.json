It was the first full game I\u00a0ever created and I am still very proud of it despite some obvious shortcomings.<br/>It is a 2D platforming game with a combat element, that is scored based on the time taken to complete the two levels. There are three types of enemies and three types of attack the player can use that each correspond to either rock, paper or scissors. Similar to the game rock, paper, scissors, the player must use the effective attack on each enemy to deal damage, while using the opposite attack will damage the player. <br/>I believe\u00a0this provides a unique experience as there is a high risk to attacking carelessly, meaning the player has to be thoughtful and precise about when and how to attack. Additionally, the varied enemy attack patterns and large number of enemies makes it quite hectic to make these decisions in the moment, especially when trying to improve your time, adding a layer of difficulty.<br/>I had various ideas on how to expand the game but for the sake of the university module, I\u00a0had to limit my scope. I may come back to this project in the future and add more content while providing the extra polish the game needs, though I\u00a0would likely port the game to a different framework if I\u00a0did so.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Player Character/Enemy Art &amp;\u00a0Animation:<br/>Linda\u00a0Vet<br/>https://twitter.com/lindavetzhu<br/></p>\n<p>Level Art:<br/><em>\"Forest Tileset (SMB3)\"\u00a0</em>by DogeMayo<br/>Custom / Edited - Mario Customs - Forest Tileset (SMB3) - The Spriters Resource (spriters-resource.com)<br/><em>\"Mi ni Ikuzo!
