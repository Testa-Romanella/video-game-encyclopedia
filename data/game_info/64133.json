{"id": 64133, "slug": "six", "name": "Six", "name_original": "Six", "description": "1. The title has absolutely nothing to do with the game play, but is the sixth development of a game idea I wrote months ago. There have been five developments of this concept and 6 is where it all comes together.<br/><br/>2. A walking/running/climbing simulator. Out run the evil that hunts a dark and creepy dungeon. No doors, the only way out is up. Climb walls and ledges to reach new rooms in the game.<br/><br/>3. New update now includes an object placement system. Take full control of your escape by dynamically creating paths up the wall during gameplay.<br/><br/>4. Instant death. No extra lives, healing or procedural damage. There are no guarantees with this one.<br/><br/>5. A casual game. 6 is not a BIG GAME! <br/><br/>6. An Idle game. To be honest, 6 is not something you play when you are in the mood for some serious gaming. Better played with a controller (XBOX 360 CONTROLLER), throw your feet up and while away the time until you're tired of being idle and ready for some serious gaming.<br/><br/>7. A 3d platformer. Take full control of the camera view for a better experience by simply moving the mouse or joystick. You decide what mode you play during gameplay, either top down or side scrolling, the camera constraints have been removed.<br/><br/>8. An adventure game. A <strong>SMALL</strong> adventure game.<br/><br/>9. Indie? YEP!<br/><br/>10. Dark and Moody? Yes. And \u201cchill\u201d paced.<br/><br/>11. Horror? it depends on the player to be honest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why should you buy/play 6?<br/><br/>1. A great price tag.  If you're the type of gamer who would play anything at least once, then you should buy this and play at least once!<br/>2. You're a collector. Looking for a little something different for your library and collection? <br/>4. You love small, indie or idle games<br/>5. You're just in the mood for something totally different.<br/><br/>I hope this has been a very honest product description. Feel free to contact me for whatever. <br/>Thanks.<br/>Robert.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/83124a5874b2771e683f8e0c23effccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 502, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert Mensah"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Robert Mensah"], "esrb_rating": null}
