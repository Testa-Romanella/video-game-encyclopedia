The player must gather resources to build defenses so that they can survive. Waves of enemies will be attracted to the player\u2019s activities, creating exciting combat to break up the slower paced resource management. The player can fight the enemies directly or rely on defenses they set up, although defenses can be damaged and must be maintained.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:48:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2ad9f17aeb436e0bf14a0465db5bc0bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["rakthalekk", "jackdeath5", "NormallyNormal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
