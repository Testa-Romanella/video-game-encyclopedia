{"id": 410182, "slug": "elemo", "name": "Elemo", "name_original": "Elemo", "description": "<p>Elemo is a 2D puzzle platformer where the player controls a character named \u201cElemo\u201d and use the element (Fire, Water, or Electric) you\u2019re given to overcome obstacles. Here\u2019s the catch: you cannot jump in this game. However, with the elements, you can find ways to traverse through the level. For example, if you\u2019re Fire Elemo, you can breathe fire on unlit campfires and use them to launch yourself to higher areas. I wanted to challenge myself by limiting a core element of a typical platformer and creating unique level design around said limitation. The levels are designed to be easy to play.</p>\n<p>The goal is to collect the City Coin at the end of each level. Once you complete all 9 levels, the game records your time and posts your best time. The best time is not saved once you quit the game application.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:26:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff3405c914cacc0132f344e9c374c034.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamluigi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
