Whether you're a hardcore Minesweeper enthusiast or just someone who wants to spend their five-minute break on something fun, this is the game for you.<br/><br/>As you clear more and more lines, the difficulty increases making it harder and harder to play. Try to beat your friends and reach the highest difficulty level!<br/><br/>Apart from the obviuos fun gameplay, this game also features a trendy look and plenty of fun achievements. With everything combined, Sweep'n'Sweep will keep you busy for tens of hours!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff51316f44a72384919feef621e8a282.jpg", "website": "http://sweepbros.com/?ref=store", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SweepBros"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SweepBros"], "esrb_rating": null}
