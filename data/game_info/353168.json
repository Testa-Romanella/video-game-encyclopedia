So I apologize in advanced if this page is\u00a0incomplete or atrocious to look at.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong><strong>:</strong> PowerRush is a game were you the player is an owner of a Power Plant Tycoon. As the population grows, its your job to supply enough power for everyone to use. The player starts with 3000 cash with that cash able to be used on various things. The player can either spend their cash on power plants or factories. Power plants produce energy which generate cash. In which case factories, which are currently not added into the game yet,\u00a0are used to speed up the process of building power plants and other factories. If your power supply goes to at least -5000, you loose the game. If however your power supply goes to at least 200000, you win the game. There is a max of 50 buildings in which you cannot delete any buildings placed down. So choose wisely on what your building.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>W/A/S/D:</strong> Moving Camera Around</p>\n<p><strong>Holding Right Click/Z/X:</strong> Rotating Camera</p>\n<p><strong>Q/E:</strong> Move Camera Up and Down</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credit:</strong> (Not real names)</p>\n<p>Developer: IndependentFire</p>\n<p>Logo: LogoMakr (Website)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Minimum Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>To be done</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommended Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>To be done</p>\n\n<p><strong>Communication:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If you liked the project, feel free to join my discord were we frequently post updates and announcements on current and upcoming games.\u00a0Discord</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T11:29:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecf55542849705e3ff76e9d57410d973.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndependentFire"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
