{"id": 360723, "slug": "the-lonely-monster", "name": "The Lonely Monster", "name_original": "The Lonely Monster", "description": "<p>The Lonely Monster is a keyboard fighter where your mission is to find the one weakness of the monster and defeat him!</p><p>First use LSHIFT + WASD to select the class of actions you wish to use. You can pick between Elemental, Magic, Potion and Weapon actions. Then use WASD to pick a specific action to execute. Every class of actions also has a defensive action that replenishes your health!</p><p>Find the attack that the monster is most hurt by and finish him!</p><p>NB! Since I ran out of time, the weakness mechanic does not really behave as it has to and the game is not well balanced. Most of the times it's pretty easy to win using whatever attack you choose. Ideally most actions would only do a minor amount of damage and you'd need to find the right one before you die yourself!</p><p>I had a lot fun making this game to the theme of \"Only One\"\u00a0for the GMKT 2019 game jam. I hope you have at least a bit of fun playing it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/038/038f63ace512f9af7fb67f395c786e7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mrtnldm"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
