Each player takes turns dropping pieces into the grid, trying to get four in a row of their color (cyan, magenta, or yellow)... but you only have access to red, green, and blue pieces and must mix them to achieve your goal.</p>\n<p>Pieces will settle as far into the grid as they can without being redundant--that is, a red piece dropped onto a green piece will mix with it to form a yellow piece, but drop another red or green on top of that yellow piece and it will stay on top.</p>\n<ul><li>Red and green mix to yellow</li><li>Green and blue mix to\u00a0cyan</li><li>Blue and red mix to\u00a0 magenta</li><li>All three colors mix to white</li></ul>\n<p>This is my entry for Pixel Weekend Jam #2.
