I originally released this game in 1994.</p>\n<p>Global Thermonuclear Warfare is a turn-based game of nuclear war, with gameplay elements of classic games Duck Shoot and\u00a0Tanks. Choose a unit, a nuclear silo or submarine, and set the angle and range. Players take turns to destroy the other side. This was my 13th Amiga game. I remade this game twice for PC, as Thermonuclear Domination (1999) (which is\u00a0also here on itch), and a 3D version called Radioactive, which was released in 2001 and updated continually, finally being remastered and released\u00a0on Steam in 2019.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T08:57:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/390b96ee88989fea96f6f60c047a16dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
