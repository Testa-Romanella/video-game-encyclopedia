I've meant it to be an experiences. but here are some information.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The game is in its <strong>alpha testing.</strong> So expect <em>minor bugs.</em>\u00a0</li><li>There is a <strong>telephone </strong>in the game its kinda <strong>important </strong>to pay attention to it. But its totally up to you.</li><li>At this stage of development the game has<strong> three endings</strong> including an endless mode. Easiest way to get to the endless mode is ignoring all the phone calls.</li><li>It is supposed to be frustrating. So please don't throw your Phone away.</li></ul>\n<p>Other than that. If you tried it, tell me if u like it or not. I'll be putting out the story, how i came up with it in a few days.</p>\n<p>Also i want to make it <strong>open source</strong> so people can look at my code and roast me. And also i think I've done decent amount of beginner level programming and will be commenting and documenting it.\u00a0 So its free for all</p>\n<p>Check it out</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Joesujin/Black_and_white<br/></p>\n<p><em>cheers</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:34:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef6/ef6c3cb387fb7dbef5bd294ef82d13b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Joe Sujin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
