{"id": 527333, "slug": "twentyfour", "name": "TwentyFour", "name_original": "TwentyFour", "description": "<p>Twenty-Four is a resource management game made in under 24 hours (hence the lovely art and riveting gameplay). Rocks and forests are the source of all your resources. Collect these resources by placing a mine or mill (mine for stone, mill for forest) nearby mines or forests. A block is considered nearby if it is touching the block either directly or diagonally (except for roads). For mills and mines to start collecting resources a house needs to be nearby. For resources to be collected roads need to be connected from mines or mills to either a storage or the King. Roads are only considered connected if they are directly above, below, left or right of another road, mill/mine or storage/king. Resources, once collected can be sold to purchase more land\u00a0 which can then be utilised. Land will randomly spawn in stone and forests for more resources. Selected an empty tile to place new land.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WSAD - Move camera<br/>Left Mouse Button - Select tile<br/>Right Mouse Button - Rotate Camera<br/>Mouse scroll - Zoom camera</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T10:37:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a1970b0ac0a06cb903dd4c622f24c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Zeppelin Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
