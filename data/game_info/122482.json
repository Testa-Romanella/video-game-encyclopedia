Thanks for all the support guys :) </p><p>You can still follow us on the greenlight page, we are planning to post a release date soon: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=721289929</p><p>NOTE:<br/>1) The game is only compatible with keyboard controls. We are working towards adding joystick controls soon .<br/>2) We are also working towards a Linux build.</p><p>Deadly rotating blades. Bottomless ditches of death. And a demented woman with an unfortunate affinity for bad puns at the most inappropriate times gunning for your death. As if that wasn't bad enough, your soul has been trapped in a doll courtesy of the aforementioned psycho-lunatic lady.<br/></p><p>Thankfully, you are otherwise granted the ability to transfer your soul into the bodies of other puppets around you. Survival in the game demands meticulous planning and perfectly timed executions. Carefully take note of your surroundings, and you might even outsmart the puppet master and get your body back. It's a game of control or be controlled.</p><p>The Puppet Master is distributed under the AMS Game Development Association, a student run game development club located in the University of British Columbia. Every year, members of AGDA get together and make new games, mixing in our collective talent and creative efforts to make fun, engaging games that are hard to put down. Our goal is to work towards expanding our knowledge of the tools, techniques, and processes used in video game development.</p><p>You can also listen to the soundtrack on bandcamp: https://ams-gda.bandcamp.com/album/the-puppet-mast...</p><p>Connect with us on:</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/AMS_GDA</p><p>Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/AMS-GDA/</p><p>Got questions?
