Use a controller to activate objects, traverse passages, and explore a dark and surreal world.<br/>The project was created to evoke the dreamlike quality in experimental cinema and sound art, and development lasted nearly two years with a team of two.  The pace is contemplative and the narrative is poetic, so take your time and keep an open mind. <br/><br/>Warning: The Final Image is not a conventional game and was created as a interactive audio/visual artwork for VR<br/><br/>Features:<br/>\u2022\tUnique interactive visual experience<br/>\u2022\tDark atmosphere and crawling pace<br/>\u2022\tRich original soundscape<br/>\u2022\tHigh-res stereoscopic-3D image spaces<br/> <br/>Credits:<br/>Martin Jarmick: Author / Artist / Developer<br/>Andrew Theisen: Co-Developer<br/>Terence and Angela Kelley: Voice Talent / Actors<br/>Adam Hogan: Camera / Imaging Associate<br/>Yun Mi Her, Sarah Maglaras: Assistance", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-29T10:04:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/835e767ce7e46a9363a0fd77e0819768.jpg", "website": "https://www.martinjarmick.com/the-final-image", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M.
