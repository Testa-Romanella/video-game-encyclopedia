This is actually my first time using the program; it's extremely short and has three endings! <br/><br/>It's probably going to lag quite a bit, Ren'Py is lacking in its' animation capabilities. This version will only work on Windows, but if you'd like it for Mac or Linux, just let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a53516d4c814b3db4dc1ceb9fbb9a25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pandora Alcorn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
