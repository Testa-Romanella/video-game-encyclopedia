You may experience bugs.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to Wall Bouncer! In this simple but really fun game, you can jump as a funny cube-shaped monster, bouncing in the walls! But be careful: lots of spikes can appear at these walls!</p>\n\n<p>There are different modes and difficulties, with more of them planned. You can play at an easy difficulty, or you can avoid deadly bombs while you try not to get hit by the spikes! Are you ready to join the adventure?</p>\n\n<p>Stay tuned, as I'll make a Discord server for this game and our future ones!</p>\n\n<p>The game's music was\u00a0made by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T18:34:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df7dd8aa966961b556b80055aed4b303.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MACKYGAMES"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
