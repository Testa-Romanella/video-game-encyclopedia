It adds a  baddie that can kill you and can be killed; if you hold jump while you  kill it, you'll get extra bounce height. This is key to beating the game  as it allows you to reach the platform with the key that unlocks the goal. <br/><br/></p><br/><br/>\n<p>Credits:<br/>https://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/chiptune-thing-no-3-victory<br/>https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-characters<br/>https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T18:20:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6e/b6ea5a3dd6fa7dab234833e71c9809fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["basilrogers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
