Moving platforms are already frustrating but if you add wonky physics and random movement it's just horrible.\u00a0On Sunday I\r\ndecided to start all over again. After a rough start my workflow was\r\nmuch better. I just spent an absurd amount of time trying to get a\r\nscore system working.</p>\n<p>If I had one or two additional days I\u00a0would work on</p>\n<ul><li>additional sprites, backgrounds and environment elements</li><li>tutorial</li><li>more visual feedback about what's going on (hitting something /getting hit)</li><li>combo system!!!</li><li>additional sounds</li><li>different points for catching\r\n\tdifferent sprites\r\n\t</li><li>seamless scene transition</li><li>playing for lowest score</li><li>alternate/ better losing / winning conditions.\r\n\tRight now you lose when you make 5 mistakes = touching big\r\n\tsprites when you're small or touching small sprites when you're big</li></ul>\n<p>Enjoy!</p><p><em>Some rules for the game if you don't want to figure them out yourself:</em></p><p>You have to hit the small shapes when you're small and hit the big\u00a0shapes when you're big (press left mousebutton to turn big)\u00a0to get a point.</p>\n<p>Every time you get a point because you hit something, they change their shape so you have to get away fast or change your own shape.</p>\n<p>If you hit a big shape while being small or a small shape\u00a0 while being big, you lose a point. In the latter case the shape will also disappear.</p>\n<p>You lose if you lost 5 points (hit 5 wrong shapes). I'm sure this isn't the best possible design for a losing condition. I think some of the most fun I had while\u00a0testing was rushing into a huge wave of shapes which right now is not really possible without losing.</p><p>I wanted the game to be really weird and I like it that you have to figure the rules out yourself but they're probably more unclear than necessary. I'll work a little bit more on it to provide better audiovisual feedback!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T06:53:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67deb0a6a5b1b9378204399cd332757a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yonn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
