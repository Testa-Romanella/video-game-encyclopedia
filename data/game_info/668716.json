Being M.U.G.E.N 1.1, the game REQUIRES OpenGL and quite some bit of RAM. Best recreation of the original Storm Generation in the M.U.G.E.N 1.1 engine EVER! It's finally time to publish! After a long time absent, i thought i would give the finishing touches to the game everyone was waiting for!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T07:34:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95ecf4844454b74aaad719cd3a111d4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FanGamesStudio"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
