(There is also mouse-only movement setting in options!)</p><p>Left mouse click for select.</p><p>ALT-ENTER or check options for FULL SCREEN!</p><p>Let me know what you think; much love, Lemth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f04/f04af2272a7885611ed798c3be7c026f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lemth"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
