I pushed things too close to the deadline, though, and the script is currently not very well written. This project is mainly a tech demo for my \r\n\tSGLscript add-on, to show its potential for making visual novels with elaborate animations difficult to accomplish in other engines--particularly in regards to 3D backgrounds.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMade for the \r\n\tDec 2016/Jan 2017 Godot Game Jam. The \"two buttons\" theme inspired the questions only having yes or no answers.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGame can be played by clicking with the mouse, or using the arrow keys and enter to select options.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOnly tested on Windows 7 64-bit. Not sure if other binaries are packaged correctly. If you have trouble, please try running the game from source in the Godot editor.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tProject under MIT license, like Godot.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGithub: https://github.com/matson48/yesno-game<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16e/16e0e61e12c69b4051eb83d6e52e26b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["matson48"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
