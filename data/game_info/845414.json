You flip the page, and you\u2019ll find that some say it is too late \u2013 and who can blame them? It seems that as much as we want to change, we find ourselves making the same decisions.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game puts the player through the qualms and difficulties of moving from energy which is harmful to the environment, to green, sustainable and renewable energy. The world heard our plea to transition to green energy, so we would prevent a catastrophic chain reaction in our ecosystems, but nobody really told us what this would mean, how it is achievable, and how the common person would be affected by these changes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The scenario presented in our game is a post-failure one. Where humanity is required to heal what once they had unconditionally.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>A scenario where humanity best couldn\u2019t prevent the evitable, thus making it inevitable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A scenario which some would describe as \u201creal events\u201d which have not yet passed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Always repeating, finding ourselves at the start of our journey, indefinitely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>OUROBOROS\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cue our little human.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We see our avatar from an isometric perspective. The player finds themselves in a desolate area. They have been sent here to heal the ecosystem using green tech, cleaning the river and planting forest seeds.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is split into exact days, with the first 3 showing the player what tasks they have to do. After finishing the tutorial, the player needs to run maintenance on these devices until they can no longer do so, and are replaced by another.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ethos of this game is humanity\u2019s continuous struggle to become a better civilisation, and this experience reveals the difficulty of healing a location which is deemed uninhabitable.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>A lifetime of sustained, continuous efforts to fix something that shouldn\u2019t have been broken in the first place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These trials are shaped in the form of puzzle games that the player needs to complete to be able to progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, after all this gloom and doom, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. The player can see how the ecosystem is starting to recover and is healing beautifully as they progress through the days. On the last day, the player should see a lush and green area being left behind, with young trees growing, where there used to be a dead forest.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T14:21:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbb7f73cc20eacf5698bdeeed85dd14a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Zbordek", "DreamNxtGen", "Alexander02", "Ross009", "peachymallow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
