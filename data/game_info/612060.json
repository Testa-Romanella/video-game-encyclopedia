To learn about the monsters, you have a few mercenaries to fight them - you can't tell them what to do, but you can tell them where to go (they trust that you know what you're doing, let's not break that illusion just yet).<br/></p>\n<p>Learning about monsters is useful not just for your future readers, but also for yourself! Every time you add something to the Bestiary, it's reflected in the game, allowing you to both experiment with information and write a guide on how to defeat the monsters for yourself.</p>\n<p>The game is controlled entirely with mouse and keyboard (mouse for interacting, keyboard for typing).</p>\n<p>The game is a solo development, made as part of my Master Thesis project in Visual Game and Media Design at the Royal Danish Academy, 2021. I designed and programmed the game.</p>\n<p>The current version of the game represents the version created for the exam. I have plans to expand greatly upon the game in the future, as well as properly explore the design space.</p>\n<p>All visuals were created by Laura Blicher (LinkedIn, Itch), all sound effects were produced by myself in\u00a0BFXR or downloaded from\u00a0FreeSound. The game was developed in Unity, and programmed in Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>Music is:</p>\n<p>Clash Defiant by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3510-clash-defiant</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Which I\u00a0edited slightly to enable looping.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T06:13:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c505f21a1bb3b7d5a321cb4c60102d64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonas Halver"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
