Some cannons fit better for a certain situation than others. Monsters come in endless waves that keep getting harder; Monsters get harder to defeat and more\u00a0monsters come as time goes on.\u00a0How far can you survive?</p>\n\n<p><strong>This game is an entry for the ludum-dare-46 game jam.</strong> The theme is \"Keep it alive\" and this game follows that theme.
