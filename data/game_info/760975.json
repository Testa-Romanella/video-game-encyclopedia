(Super Nintendo Entertainment System)", "name_original": "Super Gran Track 10: Super Mario Kart Style! (Super Nintendo Entertainment System)", "description": "<p>This game is called Gran Track 10. This is a single player game. Use the arrow keys to control the car/kart. UP arrow is accelerate, DOWN arrow is stop/reverse, LEFT arrow is move car/kart to the left, and RIGHT arrow is move the car/kart to the right, within a 60 second timer. After the timer reaches zero, the game is over.\u00a0I was deeply inspired to use a circuit track from the original Super Mario Kart game that was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. (SNES) In addition, I also added a power-up, which is a checkered strip, in which it marks the player's Laps. When the player passes the line, additional time is added to the timer. Have fun playing this retro-styled Super Mario Kart game!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T06:56:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1befa2b8a5ed601131176762401cb48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eden Losycer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
