So you can only see the negative space around the object, not the object itself. \u00a0<br/><br/>Manipulating the grid's rotation and position in relation to the camera provides the stuttering, scratched film effect. \u00a0It is not a filter, but rather the lines being drawn in slightly different directions and angles. \u00a0<br/><br/>I made a simple museum map with mostly downloaded models as museum exhibits. There is no plot or gameplay at this time, just walking around and trying to recognize objects. \u00a0<br/><br/>The look and feel of the graphics gives a distinct horror vibe though, so that's where the name came from. \u00a0If I choose to develop this further, perhaps I will add some actual horror elements.</p>\n<p>The game is made in 3D Gamestudio, A8 engine.\u00a0 I do plan to add some sound effects and perhaps music to this project before I call it complete. \u00a0I want to create a creepy atmosphere, so it lives up to its name.<br/></p>\n<p>The low resolution was applied as a filter, keeping everything 64 x 64 as required by the rules of LowRezJam.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T02:59:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27c/27cb929ab0af6442936323b342a1dc74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Schmidt Workshops"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
