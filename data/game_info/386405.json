He heard a bell on the front door. The traveling salesperson was there. It told him that it can solve his problem with one simple green potion. Even though it looked a little suspicious taken in hand it was only a shadow figure, grandpa naively drank the potion and became extremely small. Shadow figure told him it will return him to normal size after he collects 7 (for now) gems and delivers them to it in the graveyard. Old grandpa flung to the kitchen table, couldn't do anything. Throughout his journey, he fought insects like ants and spiders.</p>\n<p>This short adventure game is a combination of 3D exploration and 2.5D platformer where the player needs to collect coins over the whole level after which he needs to find a unique gem that allows him to transfer to the next level.
