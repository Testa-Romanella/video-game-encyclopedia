For every code you guess you get money, which you can spend on revealing digits of the code.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no secret to be found, so keep on guessing codes and do not look for a secret. Don't waste your time.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions on how to play the game as it can get confusing at times:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>To select a difficulty, click the button \"DIF\", select a difficulty via the keypad and click the green button.</li><li>To reveal digits, click on \"UPG\" and click the green button, if you have enough money a digit will be revealed. You can see the cost by standing by after clicking \"UPG\", the text changes.</li><li>To view your statistics, click \"STAT\". Stand by after clicking \"STAT\" for the text to change.</li><li>If you <em>accidentally</em> click \"EXIT\", do not click the green button (as it will close the game, duh), instead click the red button or select a difficulty, and you can keep playing the game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Leaving a comment would be greatly appreciated!</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T09:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e005b5eb4237ba94f93bbb81f0aa315.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["AtomicTaco"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
