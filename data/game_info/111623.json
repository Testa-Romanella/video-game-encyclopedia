{"id": 111623, "slug": "eleminer", "name": "Eleminer", "name_original": "Eleminer", "description": "<p>\r\n\tYou are an Eleminer, one of a select, fearless, and questionably-motivated few who pilot mining vessels through the turbulent depths of element-rich asteroid fields.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBrave the asteroids of Riga IV and collect resources left behind by mining drones. Use quick reflexes and a disruptor beam to protect your ship, and traktorpaks to save your cargo from flying rock.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tInspired by classics like Asteroids, Galaga, and Snake, Eleminer returns to the classic roots of arcade gaming, but with a twist: the further you progress through the game, the more vulnerable you become. Each pod you collect extends your tail further into the asteroid field; pair careful maneuvering\r\n\t with tactical greed to make it through eight zones of increasing chaos.\r\n</p><em>Important note about installation on Mac:</em><p>Due to OSX's Gatekeeper, you'll have to right-click the installed application the first time to run it, and click 'Open' on the dialog asking if you're sure you want to open. More info here; I plan to properly sign future versions of Eleminer (see <strong>Gold?</strong> below).<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Featuring:<ul>\n<li>Hot spaceship-on-asteroid action</li>\n<li>Classic arcade gameplay</li>\n<li>That deep, deep space feeling</li>\n<li>Morphing level bounds</li>\n<li>Original soundtrack and vector art</li>\n<li>Global scoreboards</li>\n</ul><br/>\r\nTechnical thingies:<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Best played with any gamepad (e.g. Xbox 360)</li>\n<li>...works with keyboard, too</li>\n<li>Mac OSX / Windows</li>\n<li>Preferred screen resolution of 1920x1080</li>\n<li>...but you can play it on smaller/larger screens too</li>\n</ul><br/>\r\nBeta!<p>\r\n\tEleminer is currently in Beta, which means there are more improvements to come.
