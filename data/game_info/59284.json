{"id": 59284, "slug": "steambot-chronicles", "name": "Steambot Chronicles", "name_original": "Steambot Chronicles", "description": "Steambot Chronicles is set in a \"steampunk\" styled world in which robots (\"trotmobiles\") replace automobiles as the primary mode of transport. The protagonist, an amnesiac boy named Vanilla Bean, is found by the girl Coriander on a sea shore. His first task is to get one of those trotmobiles. From there, the game opens up with many options. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou navigate your trotmobile through the game world, sometimes encountering enemies on the way (mostly of robotic kind). The combat is done in real time. You'll also visit many cities and talk to various characters. There are branching dialogues which allow you to treat people differently. Though there is a central plot in the game, there are many subplots and game modes. For example, you can turn your trotmobile into a bus and drive people around. Other modes include a dating sim, a music/rhythm game, a stock-market game, and numerous other play modes.", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2005-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-14T19:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/713/7131cb03fc245a643714458615e5a988.jpg", "website": "https://www.atlus.com/sc/driver.html", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Irem"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "505 Games", "Atlus", "IREM"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
