The towers are lit by Caretakers, which are invisible except in the darkness created by your laser, at which point they appear as large red cubes.</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>'WASD' - Move</p><p>'Shift' - Sprint</p><p>'Space' - Jump/Double Jump</p><p>'Right Mouse-Button' - Aim</p><p>'Left Mouse-Button' - Fire</p>\n<p><em>Note: the game needs sounds, tutorials, pause menu's and a bit of tweaking.
