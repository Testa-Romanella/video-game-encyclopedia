{"id": 545511, "slug": "red-is-blue", "name": "Red Is Blue", "name_original": "Red Is Blue", "description": "<p>This game was created for\u00a0The C64 'Cassette 50' Charity Competition\u00a0and will not be released until the competition is over. You can still play it in a browser.</p>\n<p>This competition is about creating a brand new compilation tape - with any proceeds to be donated to Special Effect Charity - featuring games by C64 developers of all levels of experience, focusing on great gameplay in a mini-game format while still retaining the look or feel of a Cassette 50 game, an infamous\u00a0collection of games published by Cascade in 1983 and an early example of 'shovelware'.</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The aim of <em>Red Is Blue</em>\u00a0is to answer as quickly as possible if a word displayed on the screen corresponds to its colour. For example, if a player sees \"red\" written in black, this is incorrect so they have to choose a \"false\" answer by moving a joystick in the left direction. If a player sees \"pink\" written in pink, this is a correct answer so they have to choose a \"true\" answer by moving a joystick in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Up to 4 players can play simultaneously. There are 20 words displayed per game, each one worth max. 100 points if answered correctly. If the answer is incorrect, the player doesn't earn\u00a0any points. The maximum amount of 100 points goes down to zero within each millisecond, so players have to hurry before the next word will appear on the screen.</p>\n<p>In the case of playing\u00a0alone, the challenge still remains: to get the best result possible.</p><p>At the end of each game, the highest score is\u00a0displayed.</p>\n<p>Game supports CGA Joystick adapter which allows playing with\u00a02 additional joysticks.<br/></p>\n<p>Game supports PAL/NTSC/DREAN machines.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Character</strong>Control method<strong>Selecting</strong><p><strong>FALSE</strong></p><strong>Selecting</strong><p><strong>TRUE</strong></p><strong>Starting</strong><p><strong>a new game</strong></p>RobotJoystick Port 1Left*Right*Fire buttonDuckJoystick Port 2LeftRightFire buttonMushroomJoystick Port A<br/>(CGA Adapter)<br/>or keyboardLeft or \"Q\"Right or \"E\"Fire button or SpaceFrogJoystick Port B<br/>(CGA Adapter)<br/>or keyboardLeft or \"U\"Right or \"O\"Fire button or Space\r\n<p>* when playing in a web browser, use Tab for FALSE and 2 for TRUE</p>\n\r\nProject game requirements\r\n<ul><li>Code must fit under $1000 memory location</li><li>Program cannot write to memory locations above $1000 except $D000 - $DFFF area</li></ul>\n\r\n\r\nFrom author\r\n<p>Have good fun\u00a0also with other games from\u00a0The C64 'Cassette 50' Charity Competition.</p>\n<p>Thanks to\u00a0https://lvllvl.com/c64/\u00a0for great JS emulator embedding!</p>\n<p>Check out\u00a0www.commocore.com\u00a0for more\u00a0games and open source projects!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T05:08:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/751/75173faa38164c8d6b3f97993a713cbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Commocore"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
