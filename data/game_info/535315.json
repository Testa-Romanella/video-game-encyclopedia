It makes use of techniques such as binaural beats, subtle strobing, form constants, and includes a body scan meditation, a dream induction, and a soundtrack developed by a healer with experience leading traditionally inspired ceremonies. The experiences in Visitations allow users to turn inwards and explore their own stories and mental states. The spaces are open vessels waiting to be filled by the conscious intentions of the users. Ancient shamans intuitively understood the power of the mind, and that their performances would conjure\u00a0 the body\u2019s innate ability to heal. Modern medicine accomplishes a similar effect with lab coats and pills. Visitations employs technology to similar ends.</p>\n<p>Development</p>\n<p>Visitations has been designed from the ground up for use with stand-alone VR headsets like the Go, Quest and even phone based VR which greatly improves accessibility and ease of use. The scenes run in real-time and are procedurally generated. They never loop and are always different allowing them to be an effective object of meditation.</p>\n<p>Art is Therapy</p>\n<p>Ancient shamans intuitively understood the power of the mind, and that their performances would conjure\u00a0 the body\u2019s innate ability to heal.
