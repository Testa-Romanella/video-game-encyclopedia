We have a fixed build and will publish when able due to the nature of the jam. Thanks for understanding and thank you for playing Remedy***</p>\n<p>You are an anti-virus program inside a Quantum Computer where data processing is represented by the Quantum Processing Landscapes. The system is under attack and it is your job to protect it. Use various weapon modes, platforms, and more to fight through incoming viruses. Use the Neural Node Network to lockdown parts of the system by activating the nodes. Keep an eye on your memory though as your program can only handle so much in one area. This means enemies, placing platforms, and even firing your mighty RAMREX virus shredder will take up memory, and you might not want to run low on that or bad things will happen. As well nodes and doors can only be accessed with all memory cleared so you\u2019ll have to clear the area of enemies before accessing the node. Time is of the essence, get out there and defeat those viruses.</p>\n<p>Remember Priority 1: Protect the System\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>If controls are stuck, pause and unpause the game, also, check your memory space, might be the issue.</p>\n<p>There are a total of 6 nodes, 1 in each \"arena\" which is defined as where the enemies spawn from portals (except the very first one). Look high and low for them and make sure you active them before moving on. The Last Node is the Center node in the junction room but requires the other rooms nodes be activated first before ending the game.</p>\n<p>Gameplay Instructions:</p>\n<p>WASD, Mouse</p>\n<p>Space \u2013 Jump</p>\n<p>LMB \u2013 Shoot</p>\n<p>RMB \u2013 Place Platform</p>\n<p>Q,E or 1,2,3 \u2013 Weapon Select and Toggle</p>\n<p>R \u2013 Clear Weapon Memory Cache</p>\n<p>X \u2013 Clear Platform Memory Cache</p>\n<p>Z \u2013 Platform Debug</p>\n<p>T \u2013 Toggle Timer</p>\n<p>LALT \u2013 Platform Flip</p>\n<p>LShift \u2013 Dash</p>\n<p>C \u2013 Momentum Stop</p>\n<p>***P.S.
