It's still kind of buggy and the game itself is really short, but I\u00a0hope to add to this idea in the future.</p>\n<p>The story is also kind of dark and meant to highlight how when we, the players, play as the hero we are essentially unstoppable.</p>\n\r\n-Credits-\r\nArt:<br/>By RunninBlood\r\nMusic:\u00a0\r\nBy ArchOfDream\r\nSound:<br/>Some By Mark DiAngelo", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:07:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d1/6d19c9a2acdea95c03a4c03ec708edfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlueLumin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
