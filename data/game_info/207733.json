Every time you get hit, you get one spirit attack, and you lose it when you use it (like ammunition). You lose them as soon as you touch a checkpoint and heal.</p>\n<p>-This is not 100% clear, but you bleed from the back. You have to fill the chalices; so sometimes, you'll have to turn around in mid-air to make sure to bleed in the right direction.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As per usual, I did the programming. I helped refine the level design a bit.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/398/39803a3766a29a49d2fb3cc3a8ec2613.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rafiki"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
