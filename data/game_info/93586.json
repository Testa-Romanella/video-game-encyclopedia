{"id": 93586, "slug": "frostfire-itch", "name": "Frostfire (itch)", "name_original": "Frostfire (itch)", "description": "<p>Frostfire is an abstract match-3 puzzle game combining both new and familiar mechanics to create deeper gameplay.</p>\n<p>To reach a higher score you need to match three or more similar chips (of the same element, fire or frost, and the same level), merging them into a single chip of the next level. You can move a chip by tapping it and then tapping its destination, provided that there is an unblocked path between these two locations. There are six levels of chips; the higher the level of matched chips, the more points you get. Merging three or more chips of the highest level (of any element) produces the final unremovable chip - Frostfire.</p>\n<p>Each new game is played on a randomly generated hexagonal board, making the game less repeatable and sometimes more difficult.</p>\n<p>Music by Robert Dooley.</p><p><em>Made with Haxe + OpenFL</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b7829b393b3a1a8d1c66ccb60661cfc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["watabou"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
