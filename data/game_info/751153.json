Losers of a Rigged Game! <br/></p>\n<p>Due  to working so much I ended up with carpal tunnel. I've been trying to  heal from that. I got a whole new ergonomic setup. I can do some low  intensity stuff now! Until I heal.\r\n</p>\n<p>This  is an improvement, combat wise, over the first and second ones. None of  this is mean to be the best possible design. This is my third  \"experiment\" testing out different narrative and design techniques and  ideas. That being said, the combat is an improvement over the last two  while the narrative, while different, is about the same level. \r\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>==========================================================================================\r\n</p>\n<p>It's  all over the news. Terrorists have taken over a broadcasting station.  They have access to television, radio and more. They are broadcasting  terrorist propaganda to everyone in the city! In the whole country!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You  don't actually care about that. What you do care about is that the  terrorist leading them all has a massive bounty on his head. A bounty  that you plan to collect. However, in order to do that, you have to make  it to the top of the tower that the broadcasts are coming from.\r\n</p>\n<p>Five  floors stand in the way of another sweet paycheck. You'll face rebels  of different kinds as you ascend to the ultimate mark. Catch your  enemies for extra change and their skills! Every time you defeat an  enemy you increase one of your stats!\r\n</p>\n<p>Use a large selection of skills and choose your playstyle. How do you want to take these terrorists on?\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>As  usual there are mini-bosses along the way. They are tougher but they  have better rewards. Their bounties aren't worth as much as their  leader's but the cash should keep you going.\r\n</p>\n<p>So  can you do it? Can you climb to the top and take down the biggest baddy  of them all? It's all that stands between you and a nice sweet  vacation.\r\n</p>\n<p>========================================================================================== <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T06:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/968/96879d342166108bb216786eac51e3d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SpicyNoodleStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
