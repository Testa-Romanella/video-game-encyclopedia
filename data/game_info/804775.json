The amount of tiles you have is limited and once you've used up all your tiles, the game ends. <br/>If you form geometric fields of the same tile type, for example, a 2 by 2 of forest tiles, you score points and gain new tiles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Complete challenges to unlock new content!<br/>Find all the different tile types. A lot of them have their own special rules!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Create cool worlds, like islands, swamps or mountain ranges.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Construct a special building tiles, like windmills, a town hall or a rocket! Each building has its own special ability. For example, the windmill turns surrounding grasslands into wheat field tiles each turn. Wheat field tiles yield a lot of points, but less new tiles when combined.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Beware of portals. They spawn evil creatures that corrupt your tiles!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Use special powerups to solve seemingly unsolvable situations.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-23T11:33:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d51/d510000cca7da9425e59e8fed8e8dbbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sokpop Collective"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sokpop Collective"], "esrb_rating": null}
