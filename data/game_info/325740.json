This remake is made for people who want to\u00a0experience the text game on their own.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use keyboard to give commands. If you give the wrong command the program\u00a0will close, forcing you to start it again.</p>\r\nSocial\u00a0Media\r\n<p>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAhAWQpZ62mAAWJSuUpfew?</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/wcDJ5CF</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game by PpTheBest</p>\n<p>Tools used:</p>\n<ul><li>Notepad++</li><li>Photoshop (For Icon)</li></ul>\r\nFAQ\r\nIs this an exact copy of the original game?\r\n<p>Sorry to say, but no. I made the levels using the information I found on internet, and it turns out this game can be finished in a\u00a0 minute, if you know the commands. It is a really short game, but is worth a try.</p>\r\nWill there be a mobile version?\r\n<p>Maybe. If this game gets a large audience, then I think I can make a mobile version.</p>\r\nNotice\r\n<p>If you have something you'd like to tell me, feel free to mail me: pratyushpriyadarshiofficial@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/dee8c5c6f500a4d31d58808e02e8bc24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PpTheBestOfficial"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
