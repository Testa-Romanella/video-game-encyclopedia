In his journey, Kramer will probe the planet itself and overcome challenging obstacles, while trying to conserve his limited life energy to power himself and his friends.<br/>Kramer will gather and share energy with his fellow robots, helping them escape dire situations and predicaments. He will have to jump and explore every platform in every corner of the 20 levels to find all of his friends. Energy is running low on Aurora, so Kramer will have to collect batteries or use generators to recharge, as every action drains his power. Various power-ups collected along the way, such as jetpacks, energy spheres and temperature regulators, can help him on this journey.<br/>Shiny is about saving lives, so it contains no blood or violence.<br/><br/>1 player<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
