Scoundrel can scan for treasure by tapping the space bar.\u00a0<br/><br/>Scoundrel can go underground by holding spacebar, which makes Scoundrel travel faster, able to collect the treasure below and changes the perspective to a top-down view.\u00a0<br/><br/>Release spacebar to pop back above ground, changing the perspective back to angled view and killing any vulnerable robots that may happen to be directly above you. The same input is used for multiple functions, which are all linked to revealing the treasure, increased speed movement to get treasure and bypass obstacles above ground, go back above ground which can also destroy any robots directly above you.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I realized that the edges of the level are cut off. Depending on your screen resolution and the one you choose when starting the game, you should be able to see most of the treasure and portals to the next level. I will try to fix this soon, along with other bugs I've encountered.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-party resources</strong>\u00a0<br/>Unity 2017</p>\n<p>Inkscape</p>\n<p>Propellerhead's Reason</p>\n<p><strong>Contributors</strong><br/>Edgar Castro @eonnomad - Code, Design, Art<br/></p>\n<p>Edgar Castro Sr @Mazin_Ed - Music (and soon to be sfx)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ff/5ff718a3019cb047f8fe019cb1152b20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["EonNomad"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
