Also, it's on a new engine that I found, so I have a good feeling that not very many people have talked about what engine the mod's on. Anyway, it's basically Phantasm, but I remixed the instrumental to make it sound just GORGEOUS. I also added Som cool effects and stuff. Anyway, I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T09:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83f/83fb3bba97836fcbd9ac2fe6bd1144c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hayden0707 on YouTube"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
