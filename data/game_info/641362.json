Read succinct summaries of what the blobs on the other end are\u00a0blabbering about, and connect them to your fellow bloberators to get them where they need to be. The bloblords demand it.<br/></p>\r\nBlobplay\r\n<p><strong>Drag your cable to a node using the mouse</strong>, and once you're happy relatively satisfied with your decision, <strong>connect the call across the company by clicking the Connect button</strong>. However, everyblob has a bad day, and <strong>some blobs struggle to call the right number</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Time is blobcash</em>, and\u00a0<strong>you can hang-up to save (y)ours</strong><strong> by pressing the End Call button</strong>.\u00a0<strong>Blobs can be impatient, and letting them\u00a0hang-up first is bad for blobtics</strong>. So <strong>whatever you do, do it quickly</strong>, and <em>we don't pay blobs to fix\u00a0other blobs' mistakes!</em></p>\n<p><strong>If our bloberators can correctly connect (or end) ten calls before making three mistakes</strong>, the company might invest a bit more in its blob welfare. <em>M</em><em>aybe you'll even earn a nice stamp\u00a0</em>\u263a.</p>\n<p>Oh, and we pride ourblobs in allowing bloberators the legally-required levels of workplace comfort. So,<strong> you can open the menu with the Escape key, and\u00a0piddle with settings using the mouse</strong>.\u00a0<em>Enjoy!</em></p>\n\r\nNOTE: THE GAME FEATURES RAPIDLY ALTERNATING DITHERED SPRITES AND BRIGHT COLOURS,\u00a0SO MAY NOT BE SAFE FOR THOSE PRONE TO PHOTOSENSITIVE SEIZURES\r\n\r\nBlobout\r\n<p>Thanks a bunch for checking-out the game. It's not\u00a0<em>super</em> fun, but I hope it's at least kind of weird and interesting. I started it as part of the 2021 GMTK Game Jam (with the theme \"Joined Together\"), but ended-up spending far more time on it over the following weeks than I'd intended.</p>\n<p>It's still quite buggy, but I'll do what I can to fix it up once I've finished up some other things. I hope it at least gets across my love of\u00a0<em>dithering</em>. Anyway, have a good one, and take care.</p>\n<p>-<em>Dean</em></p>\r\nBlobial Thanks\r\n<p>Things haven't been amazing, so thanks to the family and friends who've been supporting me for the past however long. Thanks to Matt, in particular, for having some pretty fruitful game design discussions. Also, many thanks to Adam Procter for providing the Mac and Linux builds of the game (on top of other support behind the scenes).</p>\n<p>Oh, and thanks to eurothug4000 for that palette suggestion. Go and watch her videos if you want chilled, personal videos about games, their design and their aesthetics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T08:11:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ed/0edc0d28b6bd5306a7f7ac8ec789a99b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Crowence"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
