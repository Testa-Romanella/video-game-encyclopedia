The first mentions of it can be found as early as the 13th century. Yet, it will arrive much later in Mexico, around 1779. And at that time, gambling was mainly the prerogative of the aristocracy.<br/><br/>During the War of Independence (war against the Spanish from 1810 to 1821) Lottery was one of the favourite pastimes of the soldiers. Popularized among them, the Loteria became even more popular when they returned to their families at the end of the war.<br/><br/>Then, in the late 1800s and early 20th century, it was the travelling carnivals that contributed to the growth of the game, as it was part of the diversions and activities offered during their tour through the remotest regions of Mexico.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c18/c188fcd330dcaa3f68029350ab2dd75a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sergey Riabinin"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Sergey Riabinin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
