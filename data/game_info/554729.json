To accept is to control.\u201d (Megan Chance)<h3> </h3><br/>Haunted Nightmares is a top down game that puts you into nightmares in which you are hunted by \u201e<strong>Shadows</strong>\u201c.<br/><br/><strong>These nightmares are your personal labyrinth. You have to know them to escape them and wake up in a \"Fresh Bed\" - if you can find it ...<br/>But to find this bed (in this labyrinth with locked doors, hidden keys and all the shadows behind you ...) is not enough:<br/>You can only wake up there, if you find the \"Three Orbs of Beautiful Memories\", hidden in these nightmares.</strong><br/><br/>If a \"shadow\" spots you, it will hunt you - it will not give up !<br/>And no matter how many chase you, you have to find a way out of your nightmare.<br/>Once discovered - no way to hide \u2026 So you have to run\u2026<br/><br/><strong>And you will be discovered - as it always is in nightmares.</strong><br/><br/>The question is how well do you know your nightmares - your personal nightly labyrinth.<br/><br/>If you get to know your dreams, you will find a place to awaken peacefully.<br/>Despite all the doors, hidden keys, wrong ways and sticky soil.<br/><br/><strong>Maybe it won't always be easy.
