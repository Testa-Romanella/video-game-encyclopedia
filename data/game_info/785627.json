One day, the player falls from the clouds all the way down to the ground. Away from their friends and alone on Earth, the raindrop becomes extremely sad. All the raindrop wants to do is reunite with their fellow raindrops back in the clouds. As the raindrop begins to cry, a bunch of insects nearby notice and begin to comfort the raindrop. Committed to helping this innocent new friend, the bugs agree to help launch the raindrop back into the sky as high as possible. With the help of a strong beetle that can throw the raindrop and ladybugs that can act as bounce pads, the player will have to maneuver through the sky to reach the clouds and reunite with their friends.</p>\n\n<p>\"Music:\u00a0<strong>www.bensound.com\u00a0</strong>- Funny Song\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T19:28:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a4/4a4ab751b91bd3fcc837f7ccbe8c8360.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kanaz312"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
