You play as a plague doctor desperate to save your city and people from the plague. Nothing works, so in desperation you resort to doing a dark ritual.</p>\n<p>Legends say that some entity lives in the sewers. Well, you know that it is true. It's not your first time meeting them. Only the entity can complete the ritual and help you save everyone from the plague.</p>\n<p>Your main objective is to sacrifice enough rats for the ritual to be completed. You can use items to make your job easier and to catch those pesky rats running around in the sewers.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you also got the plague before the ritual. So now you have to be extra fast because the clock is ticking.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\"Rats... Alive...\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Also I don't have much time to test but I didn't find any major bugs. I hope you won't too!</p>\n<p>W/A/S/D - Movement</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p>\n<p>LMB - Use items</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Run</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T06:33:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6a/b6a546bf67b0c0abbde3cbbccb12076f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LiftyForever"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
