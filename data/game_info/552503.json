The cube has barely enough to eat but he's more than happy to share what he has with his pet. Complete the highlighted tasks to make progress. Have fun.<br/><br/>Sometimes having less to eat is better than having more to eat. Life is about sacrifices we make.</p>\n<p>I pushed my limits with this game. It's not much but it's honest work. Everything you see or hear in the game is made by me from scratch within the last week for Blackthornprod Game Jam 3 and the theme was Less is More. Sorry about the music and sound effects though.\u00a0(I kinda butchered nothing else matters there because I hadn't played it for like a year or so, sorry about that)\u00a0I had to rush them as I was running out of time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:19:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a98/a98e4734ef5a085636567bef846dbc9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["100radsBar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
