With Second Life Notifier, you can track who's getting online and offline without having to login Second Life. Second Life Notifier doesn't merely display a list of online friends. By extracting the information from the Second Life website, it can maintain its own list of who's online, providing the ability to alert you when one of your friend gets online or offline. Plus, with the optional inworld server that you can buy for only L$500, you can monitor your land, find who is in range, broadcast messages, send messages, eject undesirable people and much more.<br/><br/>NOTE: the server is needed to send messages to your friends in Second Life. However, the server is only guaranteed to work on land you purchased directly from Linden Lab. If you purchase land from 3rd parties, it may or it may not work. If you are renting land, it may or may not work. It depends on the permissions given to you by your landlord. Since this is a no-transfer object, no refund will be given. Keep in mind that messages you send to your friends will appear in their main chat window, NOT in the IM window.<br/><br/>NOTE: if you're having a problem, please contact us instead of leaving a bad review. Leaving a bad review will take you NOWHERE and doesn't help anyone. support@nemesys-soft.com.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76e/76e350e3117ae3a36b7eba084db26b6a_X6hkma1.jpg", "website": "http://www.nemesys-soft.com/iOS/SecondLifeNotifier_EN.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nemesys Software"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Nemesys Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
