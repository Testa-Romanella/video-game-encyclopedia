It was installed as a projection, several metres across, on a raised wall at <em>Wide Open</em> in 2020. This was the opening group exhibition for KEPK, an art-space located in Meanjin/Brisbane. Artists included Melina Celik, Niccol\u00f2 Masini, Fausto Vergara, Morgan Roberts &amp; many more. <br/></p>\n<p>Video documentation of the exhibition can be found here: https://vimeo.com/456810355?embedded=true&amp;source=vimeo_logo&amp;owner=116459965<br/></p>\n<p><em>enable</em> was exhibited when COVID-19 guidelines for social distancing were first eased. The artwork\u2019s main feature is two pointer fingers that fumble into and flee from one other. The force at which the two figures are drawn together is interpolated via audio spectrum data collected from the chatter and foot-traffic of the audience, anxiously interacting, via an external microphone. <br/></p>\n<p>In this version, you can experiment to your own discretion! First make sure your computers has an internal or external. Why not try clapping to begin with? Or play your own music. Unless you want a horrible audio feedback, mute your computer before opening the application. To exit, alt-tab.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T13:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b1/0b10a5cad964182844a6034f3d204a1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CLUNKK"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
