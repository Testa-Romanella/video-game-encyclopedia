Your only way of escape is by navigating the very dangerous halls, filled with deadly spikes and perilous jumps. Your candle head is however too big for you to be able to jump, but you are able to throw it. Do not stay away from light for too long though... something lurks in the shadows...</p>\n<p><strong>Buttons(Keyboard or Gamepad):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - WASD/D-Pad\r\n</li><li>Jump - Space/A\r\n</li><li>Throw Candle - K/X\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Font Used:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>m5x7 by Daniel Linssen\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sound samples:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>soundbible.com\r\n</li><li>freesound.org\r\n</li><li>\"Video Dungeon Boss\" and \"Cartoon Pizzicato\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com).
