{"id": 917830, "slug": "only-sex-in-the-brothel", "name": "Only Sex in the Brothel", "name_original": "Only Sex in the Brothel", "description": "<p>LemonPepper owns the most sought-after brothel in Europe. The house is frequented by hundreds of customers a week. Mainly because each night of sexual pleasure is supported by an extremely powerful erotic drug that is served to those who can afford it.<br />\nThis Elixir enhances sexual pleasure, transforming the user into a sexual super athlete.<br />\nLemonPepper controls everything and everyone with tenacity. In addition to commanding, she fucks with the most demanding customers and is willing to pay big money to get into her pussy.<br />\nThe pimp has an enviable team of escorts, including highly efficient sex robots. Everyone wants to participate and be part of the unbelievable brothel of Occult Pleasures. Including the most dangerous figures in the world.<br />\nHowever, LemonPepper hides something incredibly bizarre.<br />\nFirst, I need to say how popular she and her brothel are. Rich and less fortunate clients love to hang out in the sexual paradise she created. The rich want to fuck the beautiful escorts that are part of the delicious pornographic menu. Other clients (much more eccentric) prefer to fuck their robot escorts (almost perfect gynoids, if it weren&#39;t for the metallic feature of their skins).<br />\nLemonPepper has a laboratory hidden in the basement of his mansion. Why does she have a lab? What does she really do with what&#39;s left of her customers?<br />\nI&#39;ll tell you!<br />\nLemon Pepper has a hidden surprise. She uses her clients&#39; mojo to perform cosmetic procedures on the genitalia of any of her clients who can afford the treatment. The surgery takes place in the basements of the brothel.<br />\nIt&#39;s not illegal, there&#39;s an obscure group that wants to eliminate her work.<br />\nHer biggest threat is the Ultra Shame League, which uses violence to destroy the most famous and sought-after brothel in the city.<br />\nSo, LemonPepper accumulates two great functions:<br />\nServe your clientele with the best that explicit sex can offer.<br />\nAct like a superheroine, dismantling the Militia of Shame that acts indiscriminately in the city.<br />\nThe irony of it all is that there is probably an infiltrator from the Liga Ultra Pudor frequenting and enjoying LemonPepper&#39;s whorehouse.<br />\nUltra Shame League is against the pleasure of any kind. However, sexual pleasure is their favorite target. They are dangerous and fanatical for their ultra-anti-sex ideology.<br />\nAt night, LemonPepper runs his brothel. But by day, she&#39;s a vigilante seeking justice and sexual freedom for herself, her prostitutes, and her clients (of course).<br />\nHowever, what is bad can get much worse...<br />\nThe UltraShame League instituted a new anti-sex law. Such a law restricts sexual freedom for all adults in small and wealthy towns. However, such a decision only allowed the emergence of several sex cartels that fight each other for control of the city. Two stand out: LemonPepper and CreamPieHole!<br />\nLemonPepper now has a major pornographic rival to deal with.<br />\nLemon Pepper&#39;s entire effort is now directed towards surviving in this dark quest for survival and absolute pleasure.<br />\nIt is a third-person game. The player needs to interact with the characters.<br />\nThe commands are in the AWSD and SPACE keys. There is information for both the PC keyboard and the Controller.<br />\nThe player will always know when to interact with (keyboard E on the keyboard or A on the controller).<br />\nExplore the entire environment in search of clues or messages. Players can use a keyboard or controller. However, there are levels where only a mouse and keyboard will be used.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T11:29:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a3f/a3f6fffe3bafb84bf2bc2b7ba3fe8ace.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 460, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AcidPepper Development"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["AcidPepper Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
