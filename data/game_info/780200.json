He gets slightly lost and wanders into a forest where he finds a portal\u2026 Which Ghost kid obviously enters since he is a young child with no concept of consequences! It teleports him to a darker dimension of his hometown where it's always nighttime and cold. He meets other kids \u201cdressed up\u201d as monsters. (they aren't kids tho, they are actual monsters but since they both look the same they don't really care or notice anything) Ghost kid needs to find his way home again before his Moms get too worried.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T09:27:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcf/bcffac74951f669b527aafad4533b839.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kimskit"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
