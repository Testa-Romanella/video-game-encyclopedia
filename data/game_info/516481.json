{"id": 516481, "slug": "the-mad-wizard", "name": "The Mad Wizard", "name_original": "The Mad Wizard", "description": "<p>This is a port of The Mad Wizard, an NES game by indie game developer Rob Bryant, originally released in 2014. The original NES ROM is available free from the developer on his website\u00a0https://slydogstudios.org/\u00a0under \"The Candelabra Epic.\" It is a metroidvania style adventure and if you know where everything is, has a substantial 1.5 hrs of gameplay in it. (longer if you don't know where things are!)</p>\n<p>The evil summoner Amondus from The Order of the Talon has taken over Prim, Hekl's once happy homeland. And nothing drives a wizard more crazy than having their territory trampled on! Can you help Hekl defeat the enemies that Amondus has populated throughout the landscape? To do so, you will need to master the art of levitation, find magic spells that will assist you in reaching new areas, and upgrade your weapons. All of these will be necessary in order to give Hekl the power he needs to restore peace to Prim. Do you have what it takes? If you dare, venture into this, the first installment of the Candelabra series!</p>\r\nTHE FIRST CHRONICLE\r\n<p>In the vast province of Prim lies a great forest known as The Primwoods. It is here that the powerful wizard alliance \"The Order of the Talon\" has made their expedition. Among them was Hekl, also known as \"The Mad Crow\" who was dismissed from the group due to his experiments with arcane scrolls and alchemy. It seems he has lost his mind attempting to master the art of flight and was expelled for his most ambitious nature.</p>\r\nTHE SILENT OWL INCURSION\r\n<p>However, there may be more to the reason...<br/>It seems Hekl knew something of the Order of the Talon that the archleader Amondus \"the Silent Owl\" did not approve of.<br/>Amondus swiftly invaded Hekl's homeland, constructed a great floating palace in the sky, and used his powers of summoning to control a legion of evil.</p>\r\nRETRIBUTION OF A MADMAN\r\n<p>Amondus' intentions are unclear, but he has ordered his many goblin minions to steal Hekl's precious magic items and hide them throughout the land to deter Hekl's effort.</p>\n<p>Hekl's only hope is to build up his magical powers, rid the area of all evil foes, and locate the legendary trident that is known as the TRI-CASTER to give him the means of reaching the Floating Palace to defeat Amondus and restore peace at once.</p>\r\nGET STARTED ON YOUR QUEST!\r\n<p>THE MAD WIZARD is a screen-by-screen, side-view, platform adventure game in which you guide the wizard \"Hekl\" throughout an open-ended fantasy world.
