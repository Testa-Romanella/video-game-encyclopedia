{"id": 485313, "slug": "chromagraph", "name": "Chromagraph", "name_original": "Chromagraph", "description": "<p>A game about graph theory and inductive logic.</p>\n<p>See the author's notes for this game here.<br/></p>\n<p>See the source code for this game here.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a minimalist puzzle game that explores a variety of graph coloring problems. The goal of each puzzle is to color the given graph according to a particular set of rules. The game is meant to be accessible to everyone and does not require any mathematical background.<br/></p>\n<p>A graph (also known as a network) is a mathematical object used to represent pairwise relationships. We encounter graphs constantly in our everyday lives, and they can be used to represent an endless variety of physical and abstract structures ranging from social connections to infrastructure networks to biological pathways to data structures to symmetric systems of sets, just to name a few.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is divided into several sections, each of which follows a different set of rules regarding which elements can be colored and what criteria must be met in order to solve the puzzle. Part of the challenge lies in figuring out what, exactly, the rules are in each of these sections, which will require observation and experimentation.</p>\n<p>THIS IS A FREE GAME. I encourage you to download it, play with it, and modify the source code as much as you like free of charge. If, however, you really, really want to pay for it and it is within your means to do so, I would not say no to your financial support.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: This project is still in development. There is an upcoming content update which will include a proper ending and additional activities after completing the main game.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T02:56:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0f/a0f9fde61ad23181e0f71b042f759a09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Adam Rumpf"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
