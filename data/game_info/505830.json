Usually one hit on the weak spot of your opponent is enough to defeat him, but be careful - they will be able to defeat you just as easily with one hit.<h3>Unique experience:</h3>You find yourself only armed with your bow in a mysterious world in which you have to face unique boss opponents. You will die a lot as you learn how to defeat your enemies, but once you know how, you will be able to finish each of them in only a few seconds.<h3>Replayablity:</h3>As soon as you have finished the game, you can start it again and try to minimize your deaths and defeat your bosses even faster!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T02:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8d/a8d86930daebdc5253ecfca3caec0376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 374, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicolas Peichel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nicolas Peichel"], "esrb_rating": null}
