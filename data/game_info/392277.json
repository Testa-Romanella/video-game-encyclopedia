We tried to make Chernobyl Zone look as realistic as possible by using maps, photos and videos, so that houses, key locations and roads are in the same place as in reality.<br />\nYou are going to work as a standard bus driver before the explosion. Your goal is to deliver staff to the Power Plant, lift tourists to their destination points, and so on. Also, you\u2019ll have to deal with difficulties such as breakdowns.<br />\nEverything changes when disaster strikes. You\u2019ll see the destroyed 4th power unit, Red Forest and other famous places of Exclusion Zone. Help liquidators to address the impact of the catastrophe, take part in evacuation and do your best not to get large dose of radiation.Southern China, our daysWelcome to sunny jungles and narrow roads on serpentines! But don\u2019t lose your attention because weather might be cruel here. You are going to experience tsunami and floods, earthquake with rockfall, and even a deadly tornado! It\u2019s really hard to drive as there are lots of sharp corners, cliffs and impassable roads.Maximal Scenarios varietyThere are three types of scenarios:<br />\n1. Standard scenarios about driving people to their destination.<br />\n2. Scenarios with breakdowns. You\u2019ll have to deal with different problems such as faulty steering, and this is while trying to take sharp turns. But sometimes terrain can even help you, for example when you have to turn off the engine while driving off cliffs to save some fuel.<br />\n3. Disasters, from explosion on Chernobyl Power Plant to wildfires, earthquakes and tornadoes. You\u2019ll always have to keep an eye on tornado in order not to end up going straight into it. It\u2019s even more difficult when you\u2019re driving on extremely bad road where you can easily puncture a tire by driving over bump at high speed. After the Chernobyl Power Plant disaster, help liquidators to find the most radiation poisoned spots in Red Forest. But never forget that large radiation dose can be deadly for you.<br />\nThese and many other interesting situations will be available to be played!Earn experience, unlock new scenarios, buses and upgradesYou will get experience, which levels you up, for competing each scenario.
