Your objective is simple: make your way through 30 levels as fast as you can, racing against the clock to earn Gold, Silver, and Bronze rewards.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll you have to do is guide the ball left or right, timing your movements perfectly to get to that ledge, or onto that moving platform, or past those spikes, or land large gaps. Just watch you don't lose your 3 lives or you'll need to start the level again!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's a relaxing game that may test your patience as you have to wait for the ball to bounce high enough to make your next move.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGet ready to hit 'Restart', it's your friend!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T03:14:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/acc9ac3ab9df45c25c5345ee80b9c11f.jpg", "website": "https://www.bouncetrials.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProperSerious"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Properserious"], "esrb_rating": null}
