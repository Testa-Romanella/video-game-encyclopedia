Destroy all of the active bases, then destroy the enemy's greatest weapon at the planet's core!</p>\n<p>This is our last chance! The enemy grows stronger every 10 seconds! Take your Manta Fighter and destroy that weapon!</p>\n<p>Bases are becoming operational. You need to destroy all active bases quickly (those are the red ones)! Every 10 seconds they are activating bases and deploying fighters.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\nUp arrowmove forward\r\nWrotate down\r\nSrotate up\r\nArotate left\r\nDrotate right\r\nSpacebarshoot\r\n\r\n<p>Upgrades (available every 10s)</p>\r\n\r\n1Get more bullets\r\n2Upgrade speed\r\n3Heal", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T18:45:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d0/7d0a44055ff7f08266251d497ae18410.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pincushionx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
