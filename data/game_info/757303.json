Try desktop version if you want better graphics &amp; performance.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Movement:</p>\n<p>WASD : Movement</p>\n<p>Space: Speed Boost</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Mouse Wheel: Zoom in-out</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>Destroy all space objects by kiting rockets. If you make Earth people angry, they will shoot rockets at you. To make them angry, you should move fast around world (40+ km/h), they will only shoot it when you are close to it (Distance meter must be red). Arrow above you will point to closest planet.</p>\n\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>Destroying Earth early means no more rockets will spawn.</p>\n<p>Other planets will start floating around randomly when you destroy Sun.</p>\n<p>(pro tip: order should be other planets, Sun, and then Earth)</p>\n\n\n<p>Don't worry about using km as distance unit.
