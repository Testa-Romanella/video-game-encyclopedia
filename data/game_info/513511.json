Naavaris completed the destruction of Drunia by killing its last guardian, the Arch-Mage, Gonduin, the last of the 7 guardians. \u00a0Before dying, with his last breath, Gonduin, placed a curse on Naavaris, that will slowly drain his life and his skill and warned Naavaris that the curse will only reverse if he undoes everything he has done to Drunia. In order to survive and get rid of the curse, Naavaris, who set out to destroy Drunia, is now its savior.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T03:54:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/030/030d4c9cbdbc0f203cea91fea2779901.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RevenantOcelot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
