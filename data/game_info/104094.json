(for educational reasons of course). And build arenas for them to fight in.</p>\n\r\nHow does the AI work?\r\n<p>Every time they die they remember why they died, and every time they get a kill they remember what got them that kill. so through trial and error and maturing they go from wall shooting idiots to 360 no scoping MLG pro's</p>\n\r\nWhat's the gameplay like?\r\n<p>Gameplay consist of creating arenas and having the little guys fighting to the death. it takes a little while for them to learn but u can speed up time to let them train faster. This is a good game for when your doing work and you want to come back to see something entertaining when you are done or if u just have no idea what u want to do and you just wanna zone out to watching AI mindlessly kill each other. more of a calm relaxing game then an action game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a2/6a2a8a8199a0f5ca54deccac97af5781.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RexTGun"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
