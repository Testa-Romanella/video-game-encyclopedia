Every hundred years, their gilded home of Istoria would drift into view from the heavens above. Blessed rains and seeds would shower our world, granting it new life.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"No such blessings were given this time. Instead of feasts, we were given famine. Our fields now lie barren under a rain of crystalline dust. Have we committed some heretical crime to deserve this?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Or has something far worse befallen the Gods?\"</em></p>\n<p>Journey across\u00a0<strong>Istoria</strong> as you take on the tales of Asentzio, Miren and Irunai. Cross through seven chapters, vanquishing fiends and finding the truth at Istoria's peak.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><em>To all of you...</em></p>\n<p>First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who's tried Istoria in its current state for the few minutes of their time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wish it could have been more, but to be honest, there simply was no time.</p>\n<p>A challenge when accepting to participate in something like this one is that you plan a project based on your expectations.</p>\n<p>I did not expect to suddenly lose all of my remaining time, a week and a half before deadline. As much as I wish I could have been free to spend that final week implementing everything I'd planned in the document I simply didn't have the time or energy do so as we\u00a0 got to the end of this week.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank my Musician and Artist who did an amazing job getting the assets done for Istoria and to them I want to promise that their time will not have been in vain.</p>\n<p>Istoria may be a speck of what it should have been but I won't let these hours go to waste. Once my time returns to me in the winter holidays, I'll make sure to finish the game and give you what I wanted to in the first place: A true game, not this shell of a<br/>demo.</p>\n<p>I'd like to thank everyone on the Discord for the moments we shared. I'm really devastated that it had to come to this after all my efforts.</p>\n<p>Good luck everyone in the contest, hope to see you all around the forums soon!</p>\n<p>Istoria will be beautiful one day.</p>\n<p>Timespiraled</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>LEAD DESIGNER: Matt Limoges<br/>LEAD ARTIST: Ian Wilkins<br/>LOGO ARTIST: Maria Aparicio<br/>LEAD COMPOSER: Colin Gardener</p>\n<p>SCRIPTS:<br/>Yanfly<br/>Shaz<br/>Craze<br/>Fomar0153<br/>Neon Black<br/>dsiver144<br/>Galv<br/>Hime<br/>AdiktuzMiko<br/>Yami</p>\n<p>ART ASSETS:\u00a0<br/>Maker Systems - RPG Maker Source (Windows)<br/>Paper Texture Created by Aopsan - Freepik.com<br/>Maria A. - Graphic Artist<br/>Avery</p>\n<p>Enterbrain/Kadokawa</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ba/5ba4b0c4954978fc95900c309d6e8e10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timespiraled"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
