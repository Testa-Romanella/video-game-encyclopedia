Get close (but not too close!) to your enemy and attack in time with the beat. Solve puzzles, find keys, beat up blobs and generally faff about.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been an idea I\u2019ve wanted to try for a while. Some of it works\u2026 It\u2019s a little buggy, and there\u2019s no auto/input lag calibration (might add it later) so it\u2019s probably unplayable on some machines, but hopefully it works for the most part!</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls;\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow keys: Move about</p>\n<p>Z: Attack/next dialog</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fc/1fc42eed57f8c0cbdcbe6f9321b77466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["DragonXVI"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
