But I want to make it a full-fledged game, with story, levels and addicting gameplay. KOBRUN for sure turned out bad<strong>\u00a0</strong>because I literally speedrunned the development. And I got an idea to make a good sequel.</p>\n<p><em>This is the early prototype. In it I worked out the movement and physics of the character, to make the game feel more alive. Currently there's no enemies, but there are four easter eggs, try to find them! Some of them were made by my friends.</em></p><p><em>All sound effects were taken from zapsplat.com</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Got any suggestions?
