K3LVN is able to change their state of matter to alter their behavior. The three states usable are the Gel state which is the default bipedal state, the Liquid state which makes K3LVN smaller and grants the ability to climb on certain walls, and the Solid State, which turns K3LVN into a ball to roll around and gain momentum. They must use these abilities in combination with each other to traverse the environment as quickly as possible. <br/><br/>K3LVN was developed by RNG Forge, a group of students at Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA), over the course of eight months.<br/><br/>Key Features:<br/><ul><li>Play as K3LVN and master his ability to change his state of matter<br/></li><li>Roll around the environment and gain momentum as a icy, solid ball<br/></li><li>Run and wall jump as a slimy, bipedal experiment<br/></li><li>Morph to your surrounds, climb walls, and squeeze through tiny gaps as liquid blob<br/></li><li>Test your wits in a series of puzzles that require quick thinking and even quicker reflexes<br/></li><li>Enjoy a somber story about trust and understanding<br/></li><li>Take in a beautiful art style with wonderfully rendered characters and breath-taking scenery <br/></li><li>Avoid dangerous robots that wish to recapture you and send you back to your cell</li></ul><br/>Controllers, Keyboard and Mouse<br/>This game is designed to be played by either a controller or mouse and keyboard.
