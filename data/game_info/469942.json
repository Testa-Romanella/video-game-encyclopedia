Originally written in 2005, it uses SDL 1.2 and the SDL_Mixer library for sound effects and music.</p>\n<p>This is a pretty straightforward Tetris clone written in C using SDL 1.2 and SDL_Mixer. I went ahead and tried to make this a pretty big deal - as expansive a game as I've ever written. Not saying much, I know, but it's got all the features a basic Tetris game should have:</p>\n<ul><li>Scoring and high scores</li><li>Saves game options</li><li>Piece lookahead</li><li>Attractive graphics <em>(ha ha)</em></li><li>Custom music and sound</li></ul>\n<p>Every 10 lines cleared will advance the level, up to a maximum of level 9.</p>\n<p>Scoring works like this:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>1 line = 1 point</li><li>2 lines = 3 points</li><li>3 lines = 6 points</li><li>4 lines = 10 points</li></ul>\n<p>Tetris clones can get pretty advanced these days: there are algorithms for generating \"fair\" pieces e.g. 7-bag, special moves (T spin and wall kick), hard drop, \"ghost\" piece images, and so on. In the interest of simplicity, my clone does not bother with any of that.</p>\n<p>The source code is included so you can check it out. There might be some useful bits in there for learning SDL 1.2.</p>\n<p>If you like the music enough, just ask me and I'll probably let you stick it in your own projects.</p>\n<p>This was originally written for the now-defunct University of Arkansas Game Development Club.</p>\n<p>Thanks for trying my game - I'd love to know what you think.</p>\n<p>-Greg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da2/da268e7d7074520aa7d4a25fb3b6d96a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["greg-kennedy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
