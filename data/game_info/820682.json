Some explode and some leave a trail of fire, depending on how they land! Try to survive through 6 levels and upgrade your dice loadout in between rounds.</p>\n<p>You are equiped with two dice, one that is thrown using the left mouse button and one using the right mouse button. Each has six sides and each side can be slotted with a different effect. Additionally, you can upgrade the dice themselves to improve their slotted effects! The dice cycle randomly through their equiped effects, the currently selected one is shown next to the player on each side. Throwing a dice\u00a0puts that side on cooldown for a bit, which is also shown next to the player.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- WASD to move</p>\n<p>- Left / right click to throw your dice in the direction the player is\u00a0currently facing</p>\n<p>All code and all\u00a0assets were created during the duration of the jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c13/c13982ffbb85da7951a60579f3a77224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["random.squid"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
