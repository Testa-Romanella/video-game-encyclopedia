You can do this by first identifying the pattern and then making use of the last number to extend the sequence. Sometimes the missing numbers may be located within the number sequence. You can use the surrounding numbers as a guide.<br/><br/>With practice, a variety of common number patterns can be identified. This requires careful observation. Identifying patterns involves being able to look at features such as differences (the amounts between numbers) and rates of change (how quickly the numbers are seen to increase or decrease).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c55b004293a919425ef903bb6de5fad9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Andres Narvaez"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Andres Narvaez"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
