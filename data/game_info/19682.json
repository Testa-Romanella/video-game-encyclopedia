Developers became studio Liquid Entertainment, and the publisher company Codemasters. The game appeared on the PC and on the most popular consoles of its generation: Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>\n<h3>The story and the setting</h3>\n<p>The plot of the game tells about Jason, and the action takes place in Ancient Greece. Like God of War, the game uses ancient Greek mythology to build a game universe. The modified myth of Jason and the Argonauts, who went on a journey for the Golden Fleece was used as inspiration. According to the scriptwriters of the game, Jason is a Greek king, whose wife was killed in front of him. The only way for a grieving husband to return the beloved is the Golden Fleece, which can resurrect the dead. Other well-known heroes of myths appear in the game: Hercules, Achilles, Medea, Medusa, Patroclus, and others. Together they travel through a variety of real and imaginary locations: Iolcu, Delphi, Mycenae, Tartar, and Kifr.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game consists of a large number of dialogues and enemies confrontations on vast, detailed levels. In contrast to God of War, critics point out simple battles with bosses and the strange arrangement of enemies on each level, which also simplifies the gameplay. You can use a sword as a weapon, a spear, and a mace is also available. Each weapon has its own characteristics and offers different gameplay: the mace breaks shields, but can not cope with a large number of enemies, the sword reduces the player&#39;s defense capabilities, but increases the effectiveness of melee combat, etc. In addition to these weapons, you can upgrade Jason skills on four branches: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. Points for upgrades the player receives as the tasks are completed and for the correct answers in the dialogs.</p>", "metacritic": 59, "released": "2008-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-20T22:04:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/760/760b379c7d3ab6eb68375fba0f81aa96.jpg", "website": "http://www.rise-of-the-argonauts.com/", "rating": 3.02, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 59, "owned": 1213, "beaten": 53, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 36}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 92, "suggestions_count": 650, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 95, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Liquid Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
