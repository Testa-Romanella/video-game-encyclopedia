In it, the player takes on the role of a shadowrunner, hired to assist in the hacking of holoboards across the endless city streets of the Sprawl. The objective is to score as much data for your employer before suffering from the inevitable deceleration trauma that comes with plummeting down skyscrapers with nothing but your augmented legs to keep you up. Made in Unity 3D for PC by a team of ten people. <br/><br/>If time permits after development of other titles, an iOS/Android port, with much more polish, and more attention to balancing will be worked on. Hope you enjoy it.
