{"id": 509654, "slug": "ads-asteroid-destruction-simulator", "name": "A.D.S (Asteroid Destruction Simulator)", "name_original": "A.D.S (Asteroid Destruction Simulator)", "description": "<p>You are a lone space explorer searching for ways to train your body and reflexes, and in your way around space you find an massive asteroid to explore. This isn't just any other massive asteroid though, but a queen one! Now, smaller asteroids are zeroing on your location and you can't see any better way to train than now, so ready your weapon and skills and take 'em down!</p>\n<p>You might be wondering why asteroids have a common hive mind and a queen. Well you are in space and questions like that won't help you survive, instead use pistol and <em>click</em> on the asteroids to destroy them and accumulate points by doing so. Survive long enough and your <em>Ultimate</em> will be ready, press [Spacebar] to unleash an attack which will destroy any asteroids on screen. You only have so much energy as a space explorer so don't let 'em hit you.<br/><br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>This small project of a game was made with the help of <strong>Sofia Ribadeneira</strong> who helped me with the background of the game scene, give her a follow!
