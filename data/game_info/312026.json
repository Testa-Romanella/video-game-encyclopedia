I am not a game design major so this is my first attempt at making any type of game. I tried to use the skills that we learned in class to make a simple 2D game. Simple plat former that incorporates items from class.\u00a0 The sprites that I used I found online, found here. I chose this character since I thought that it was unique. The girl avoids the uncanny valley she doesn't look like an average female. The use of color was also pretty interesting. In the color reading that we had a while ago it mentions that colors have different meaning. Blue is typically associated with males so I thought it was interesting that the female had blue hair.\u00a0 Also the different shapes in the hair and on the clothing help to make the character more unique. The spikes in the hair help to give the character and more aggressive/scary feeling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As mentioned above this is my first game. I based it off of the things we did with the bird/robot in class. I dont know if this is too simple of a game since you cant win, or anything, but it took me a little to remember how to get everything working.</p>\n<p><strong>Images</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Authors</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Cole Burkhart</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T04:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75f/75f165e1f80d64239170b75f23619ef6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ColeBurkhart"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
