After oil rig exploded, you must drive a ship and collect the oil barrels, to prevent them from destroying the ocean. It gets harder with time :) You have to bring barrels back to the starting station. Your maximum capacity is 9 barrels.</p>\n<p>You drive with WSAD, you can reset your ship with R and you can also look around with RMB.</p>\n<p>Most of the effort went into the simulation of the water interaction. Ship (and other things) are rigid bodies, which have several buoyancy points that push these items up based on their individual sink values :-) It takes into account the depth, slowes down too fast movements, significantly decreases movements sideways, etc., which is why, it is kinda fun just to run around on the waves :) (at least, I hope so). I couldn't have spent so much time on just that if my wife didn't learn the Blender, but she did and she had drawn the ship and barrels :-)<br/></p>\n<p>PS: The waves are progressively larger as the game goes on ;).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:09:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e4/5e4749d07a0e5131f6f10ac2e316e454.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GonziHere"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
