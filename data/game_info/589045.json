{"id": 589045, "slug": "vibrant-shields", "name": "Vibrant Shields", "name_original": "Vibrant Shields", "description": "<p>Game:</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as a block trying to block projectiles. If you get hit by a projectile, you lose. Coins also spawn. If you block them with a barrier, they just explode. But if you don't block them, you'll earn a coin, which can be used to save your run if you lose. The difference between the projectile and the coin is that the projectile has a trail. The coin does not have a trail, it also has a pulsing effect, and its icon\u00a0looks different.\u00a0You can also switch between skins, and there are currently forty in the game. The game is still in development, so expect updates! Feedback and ratings would be appreciated! <strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> your high score, coins, skin, sound effect\u00a0and music volume, and color of the game will only be saved if you quit using the quit button in the main menu.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nAction:Input:Block right side.Right arrow-key, DBlock left side.Left arrow-key, ABlock up side.Up arrow-key, WBlock down side.Down arrow-key, S\r\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>The game font is Origami Mommy and made by Tepid Monkey Fonts.</p>\n<p>The warning screen font is Open Dyslexic and made by Open Dyslexic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T08:58:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7c79b6d93511f449ebb05e397cdbd73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["A J"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
