Includes a mini-game in which you collect coins from 5 landmark locations.</p>\n<p>I made the map\u00a0from Google Maps 3D data using\u00a0MapsModelsImporter\u00a0by Elie Michel. I used the drone model and physics scripts from\u00a0this tutorial\u00a0by Indie-Pixel.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is not meant to be an accurate simulation, instead just a prototype to practice my skills and\u00a0explore\u00a0what can be done using satellite data. I plan to continue working on this project so view this project's\u00a0GitHub repo\u00a0for more info.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T06:43:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/493/4931d5160e2e35f9157bf094b350f926.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["omarkhan03"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
