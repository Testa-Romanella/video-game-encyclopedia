You have never seen Earth and you\u2019ll never see Proxima Centauri either. You\u2019re doomed to live and die on the Ship in the name of the Mission, like your father before you, like his father before him.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ship is old. She had already been twenty years in service when she was rechristened Starfarer - a pretty name for a retrofitted interplanetary freighter. No one is certain the Ship will actually reach its destination, and nobody much cares, since no one alive now will live to see it. Might as well get on with your life and try to make the best of it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFeatures:\n<br/>\n<br/>\nColony Ship is an isometric, party-based RPG inspired by Heinlein\u2019s Orphans of the Sky.
