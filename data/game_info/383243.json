Using your ship, the <strong>Fabric Tear</strong>, you must find weak points in collapsing waves of spacetime and cut through them, preventing total collapse.</p>\n<p><strong>BUT WATCH OUT...</strong></p>\n<p>Spacetime is chaotic, and may sometimes reverse... causing waves of distortion to flow outward. When this happens you must seek out new weak points and slice through them, bringing balance to the rift.</p>\n<p>Put simply: dodge the moving blocks, and cut through the colored ones.</p>\r\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>Use <strong>WASD</strong> to control the <strong>Fabric Tear</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>W</strong>: Move Outward\r\n<br/><strong>S</strong>: Move Inward\r\n<strong><br/>A</strong>: Move Counter-clockwise\r\n<br/><strong>D</strong>: Move Clockwise<br/><strong>Enter</strong>: Start Button<br/></p>\n<p><em>Cut</em> through colored blocks (or let them come to you) to sunder spacetime.</p>\n<p><em>Be careful!!</em> The <strong>Outer Rim</strong> (two outer rings) is <em>dangerous</em>. You have to move <em>twice as fast</em> to cover the same ground, and getting caught <em>between blocks</em> can be <strong>deadly</strong>!</p>\r\n\r\nGo for the high score!!!\r\n<p>As you play the game will speed up, increasing difficulty. The longer you play, the higher your score. Losing is inevitable, but the more time you spend saving the universe, the more survivors there will be in the end. The rest will be forgotten to time.</p>\n<p>If you are a <em>wizard</em> or <em>minor diety</em> and you somehow reach a score of <strong>9999</strong>...\r\n<em>CONGRATULATIONS!!</em> You get a kiss on the cheek from the <em>entire universe</em>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:57:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10f177ffed89c3e4c982547c8d784d58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["xezton"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
