Enter a rich, atmospheric world that takes heavy inspiration from Celtic mythology, build up your party through various customization options, take on secret quests to unlock the best weapons and equipment, and most of all, have fun!</p>\n<p>It is completely free to play. You don't owe me a single dime.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d55/d559b57f6ee5a9e2651a8abb0e95fde6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luchi"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
