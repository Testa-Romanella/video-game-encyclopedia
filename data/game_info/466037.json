But beware you must extinguish it with the right color (as pictured on the panel). Spraying a liquid makes an other pump's gauge fill faster\u00a0and if its bar goes full it will overheats\u00a0and more fire will spread ! Try to manage the level of each gauge while dealing with fire.\u00a0 When a fire has grown to its maximum size it deals continuous damage to the factory. Protect it worker !</p>\n\n\r\nCredits:\r\nSprites:\r\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/sci-fi-interior-tiles<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/toxic-barreldrip-animation<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/water-tiles</p>\r\nSound Effects:\r\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/skweaks</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/stream-sounds</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/spell-4-fire</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style</p>\r\nMusics:\r\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/australis-frontier</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/productionlife<br/></p>\r\nFont:\r\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/fonts/free-pixel-font-thaleah-140059#content</p>\n\r\nOther art and code:\r\n<ul><li>thebananeman\u00a0https://thebananeman.itch.io/</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Kojitie :\u00a0https://kojitie.itch.io/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bed/bed4ddf98b16cbc4b9a900887de4ddf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["thebananeman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
