It's about learning to develop Unity games, late into the night. There are at least 5 unhappy endings, as well as exactly 1 happy ending. Beethoven provided the game's soundtrack, and I'm hoping he's cool with that.</p><p>This is the first game to be publicly released by me and hopefully not the last. Any feedback would be appreciated, but even if you don't have any fun playing it, know that I had lots of fun making it. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f6/8f6fce993d1e44aa550ebd2c55838a0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bad Puns Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
