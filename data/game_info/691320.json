The lands awaiting you are harsh and unforgiving for most, but you have curiosity on your side. Discover planets long lost, and yourself.</p>\n<p>Something tells you the answers lay at the very top, if one could just keep climbing...</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>The game is played by two players splitting up a single keyboard. One controlling their character by W, A, S D and the second one with the arrow keys. The goal of the game is to get to the top before your partner does. There are puzzles and obstacles in the way that require more of quick thinking and reactions than a strategic planning. Along the way numerous shooting mechanics are introduced that differently affect your environment, so watch out carefully to what they do and adapt quickly!</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the game is not finished. :( Far from it.
