{"id": 16172, "slug": "gravilon", "name": "Gravilon", "name_original": "Gravilon", "description": "<p>Gravilon is a thought-provoking puzzle-platformer without a jump button. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>All the player has to do is explore the Gravilon world and to reach the end. The game has no enemy NPCs, no collectible items, no achievements. The movement mechanics are simple to follow up, even though the mechanics are a bit different from those in other platformers: to complete each level, the player can use power-ups and inherent gravity-bending powers. The level design builds on itself as time passes, which allows the player to learn it more. The levels and game mechanics are designed to encourage exploration and to allow for creative pathfinding \u2013 there is no one correct path for most levels, there is only (arguably) the fastest, most efficient route.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Standing in the way of you and that end is a world is frozen in stasis, its secrets locked away. The levels and game mechanics are created to support exploration and allow creative pathfinding; throughout the play, the player learns more about his role in the game world. There are no correct paths for most levels; there are even no fastest routes. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed; this is the type of game where you stay and see how the story unfolds in front of you: at first, the surroundings are in black-and-white colors, but gradually they become yellow and bright.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:22:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb9/fb9314ab3b1f2c38243b9bc8b4ebf150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.86, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 40, "owned": 930, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 11, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 58, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 58, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["gravdev, Fan Wu"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["gravdev"], "esrb_rating": null}
