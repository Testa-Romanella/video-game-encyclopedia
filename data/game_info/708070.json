Our team's wishes were:</p>\n<ul><li>\"This year I really want a train to play with. Thanks. P.S: I also love cheesecake\"</li><li>\"I have always wanted a cute pet alligator that can fly\"</li></ul>\n<p>Using this prompts we came up with an idea for a game involving a train security guard checking tickets, while walking his\u00a0flying pet alligator. The alligator would constantly try to eat passengers, it was up to the player to only let him eat non-paying costumers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:49:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e77e97028700705bdb273b858661e6b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JoJo", "MiguelSeabra1999"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
