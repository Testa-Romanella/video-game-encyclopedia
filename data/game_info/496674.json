Whether it was the original release on the Commodore 64, the slightly-cut-down version that came with the Atari Lynx, or a port from any one of around a dozen other platforms, the unique sun-drenched sports tend to conjure up fond memories from all who played them.<br/><br/>It was inevitable that such a highly-regarded game would be afforded a sequel, and Developer Epyx did not disappoint. By the time the game came out in 1990, 16-bit home computers had become commonplace, meaning that the Amiga, Atari ST and SNES were among the launch platforms.<br/><br/>Now available officially on Steam for the first time, you too can enjoy the five radical and awesome events:<br/><ul><li> Hang-gliding<br/></li><li> Jet-skiing<br/></li><li> Snowboarding<br/></li><li> Bodyboarding<br/></li><li> Skateboarding</li></ul><br/>Just like the first game of the series, California Games II is easy to play but hard to master, with plenty of playground arguments about which event was the best.<br/><br/>So get ready to soar like a boss, dust some ice and kick some sweet ollies with this radical and bodacious sequel to one of the most popular games of all time!<h3>From the original manual</h3>Yo!
