You require a computer to play. It is a prototype  created only for gathering data and using this data to change further  versions fo the game. It looks very bad but theres no point making  things look nice if it all gets changed in the end...\r\n</p>\n<p>In this  game, you are a motorsport team leader. You must tell both your drivers  when to speed up and slow down in order to win the race. \u00a0Dont run out  of fuel, or you wont be able to finish the race. \r\n</p>\n<p>This game  was created to collect data as you play. I will take the data and  analyse it to hopefully implment improvements to the game in its next  version.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If you wish, you can opt out of data collection. No  personal data is collected, only things like total play time,  start/finish position, remaining fuel. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T13:16:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c64c15a5936bf278469fcda55eefeb63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OnlyInTheBath"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
