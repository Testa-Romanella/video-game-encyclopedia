Gun Runner is a trading game inspired by classic trading games like Dope Wars &amp; Drug Wars. <br/> <br/>The basic rules of trading apply. Buy low, sell high. You must fund your operations by borrowing money. But be careful, the cost of borrowing is very high so you'll need to know the cost of goods to keep ahead of those interest charges\u2026<br/><br/>To make progress you'll need to aim high. Borrow as much as you can get but only when you know what you\u2019re going to buy and make sure you're getting a good price. The interest rates are non negotiable and the penalties are harsh. <br/><br/>And by the way the Interpol is after you. There\u2019s nothing you can do, that\u2019s the cost of doing business.<br/><br/>===========================<br/><br/>BTW - your borrowing power is 200x your cash - debt on the 30 day level", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c1/9c15583510d1bb289bcc184d962abedd.jpg", "website": "http://www.cubicmobile.com/gr", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["CUBIC digital"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["CUBiC digital"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
