This is controlled with A, and D (A being left and D being right) rotation steering. Then to lift the rocket in the air is to press the space bar! There is five different worlds and a winning screen. There are these black pads that don't kill you that are\u00a0on the right wall on level 4 and on some spots on level 5.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, these level get exceptionally harder and harder to the point of almost impossible if you complete then you're a video game god. This is game that I've created from the course on Udemy and this is what came out of it. Hope this is fun and by the way, I turned the up the difficulty exceptionally just for that Youtube like \"OMG HARDEST GAME EVER\" vibe.\u00a0Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T08:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c7/2c7d6f40d0dd6010ce066d2ff08bd872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jaronamoe Tophat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
