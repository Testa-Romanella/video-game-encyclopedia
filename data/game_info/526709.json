Welcome to Moon Racer, the first game by Team L33&amp; Gameworx.<br/><br/>Moon Racers is a 2D end-to-end race featuring 4 astronauts\u00a0who, minding their own business, have their card game rudely\u00a0interrupted\u00a0by an asteroid shower which takes\u00a0out almost all of their\u00a0Space Rockets. Only one has survived and only one astronaut can leave the moon, will it be you?<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>D - Forward<br/>A - Backwards</p><p>Who are Team L337 Gameworx?</p>\n<p>We are three friends studying at West College Scotland, Silviu, Ryan, and myself Will, we have\u00a0\u00a0never met face to face due to the pandemic but decided regardless to\u00a0 team up and\u00a0participate in the game jam together and use our common skills and knowledge gained from our (at the time of writing) 2 months at college to create a game.<br/><br/>We view this project as a learning experience, putting our collective knowledge to the test, pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones and working on our teamwork, time and project management and most importantly learning to use what we know outside of a college setting, deciding for ourselves what needed done and how/when we wanted to do it.</p><p>Will (check out his itch page for this and future projects)<br/></p><p>https://twistdrabbit.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Silviu (check out his itch page for this and future projects)<br/>https://noelstudios.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Ryan (check out his itch page for this and future projects)<br/>https://thatguyflux.itch.io/</p>\n<p>We were very excited about the project and even though we had to juggle assessments, college work and everyday life we are very proud of what we were able to build given our limited skillsets.</p>\n<p>We certainly had a lot of amazing ideas that we would have liked to add to the game but unfortunately, due to our limited skillset, we couldn't implement them all.\u00a0 We decided to leave some of our more adventures ideas for future updates when we have gained a wider knowledge of the software we are using so keep an eye out for those coming in the future.<br/><br/>Will</p>\n<p>The game is made using Unity 2D and Visual Editor\u00a0using Art created by Myself in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
