Score on your own net (winners are losers TO Jam 2018).</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 2018 48-hour Toronto Game Jam TO Jam. It is a 2-player air hockey game where the objective is to score on your own net. You can each power 2 power ups: beaver dam and maple syrup. Beaver dam blocks your opponent from scoring on their own net for 3 seconds, maple syrup slows their movement for 3 seconds. Spacebar rotates between splash screen, game and reset.</p>\n<p>Hope you have as much fun playing as we had making it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/827/82734e2a42a75228735ada614e463286.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["mapletrees"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
