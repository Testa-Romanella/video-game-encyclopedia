{"id": 421063, "slug": "bongo-island", "name": "Bongo Island", "name_original": "Bongo Island", "description": "<p><strong>Short Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Hit bongos in time to the music in a piano tiles style rhythm game</p>\n<p><strong>Notice:</strong></p>\n<p>This is my 2nd ever jam and game, so go easy on me. The game was written in Love2d so there are a lot of limitations compared to something like Unity. And yes, the drums aren't actually bongos, they're African drums. But \"Bongo Island\" sounds a lot better than \"African Drum Island\", plus we wanted the tropical island style.</p>\n<p><strong>What is this?</strong></p>\n<p>The island's totem's have gone crazy, they need some soothing music to calm them down. You're the only one who has bongos to hand, so you must join the band and attempt to soothe the totems with some calming music. Fail to keep up with the band and you'll lose! Keep up and help calm down the totems!</p>\n<p><strong>Theme &amp; Limitation:</strong></p>\n<p>The game follows the theme by being located on a tropical island. Pretty much every asset revolves around this tropical island theme. You can't get much more islandy than tropical islands.</p>\n<p>The limitation is followed by simply having 1 song, at 1 difficulty. We'd have added difficulty scales but in honour of following the limitation as much as possible, we decided against it.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming: Owain</p>\n<p>Art/Assets: Charli</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Jump and Run - Tropical Mix (We tried so hard to write our own music, but that stuffs a lot harder than it looks...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T02:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6f/a6fa1dcaa5f1ae2b18f9e91274bbf5f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Owain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
