All that changed ten years ago with the discovery of the Elemental Spheres. Once thought to be mere legend, these powerful magical artifacts had an immediate affect on the kingdom, plunging it into confusion and chaos. The royal family decreed that the Spheres be scattered to the corners of the world lest they cause more destruction. They were too late. The presence of the Spheres corrupted the Champions protecting them. Now Tristan, Emperor of the Infernal Empire, has set his sights on conquering the Spheres. Only the Kingdom of Eldevin stands in his way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-15T21:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23b/23bf5104764f7ac9850b22f50cf8f0e7.jpg", "website": "http://www.eldevin.com", "rating": 2.76, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 470, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 7, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 555, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Hunted Cow Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hunted Cow Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
