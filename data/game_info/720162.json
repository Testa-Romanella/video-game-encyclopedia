(I don't have a Mac to develop on).<br/></p>\n<p>This demo only consists of one level, but I do hope you enjoy.<br/>The game is very much a contra-clone with a SMASH-TV styled 2 axis shooting system.<br/>I would highly advise setting up a control pad for desktops and on any Android TV system (in fact I dunno how else you would play on an Android TV system).<br/></p>\n<p>If you notice any big glitches or errors, please do leave a message and inform me of the system you are running the demo on and a description of the glitch.<br/>My apologies for not having a good scaling system for displays in this demo, it will literally just distort the games native resolution to your screen... sorry wide-screen users... I will be correcting this soon for the engine to allow some nicer scaling options.<br/></p>\n<p>Also; please do tell me if you enjoyed the demo and would be interested in a full game. I'd probably sell it for $1, but it would contain more levels, a 2 player mode (for two gamepads... I've never done network code before, and I like the old school setup), an actual story (something fun and silly), more disturbing designs, big bosses and set pieces like the old arcade run and guns. I will also listen to your suggestions.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking this out.<br/>-K. A.
