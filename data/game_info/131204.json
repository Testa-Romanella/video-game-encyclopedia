It's your goal to collect as much veg as possible!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created in around 5/6 hours with myself doing programming, Viktoria \"Nethi\" Nestorova doing the art and Chris Delaney creating the audio. Basically, we didn't want to go to a guest lecture so we made a game instead, as you do.</p>\n<p>Let us know what you think!
