Each dot circles around a fixed point, until a button is pressed*, then the point around which the dot rotates switched sides to the other side of the dot.</p>\n<p>In such a way, it is possible to navigate the entire play-screen for each player with only a single button or key!</p>\n<p>*] Either through keys, 1, 3, 7 and 9 (key rebinding is available in the 'logo'-menu), for each player respectively, or through mouse or touch in the respective 'area' for that player.</p>\n<p>Those areas are in each labeled corner -- the middle of the screen re-opens the menu)</p>\n<p>The different modes are:</p>\n<p>'Bounce' for 2, 3 or 4 players.</p>\n<p>Bounce the ball from dot to dot (player to player) -- the counter will rise.</p>\n<p>Don't hit any of the four sides of the screen! Then the counter is reset to 0.</p>\n<p>'Versus' for 4 solo players or 2 teams of 2 players.</p>\n<p>Get the ball in the other players goals, just as often until only one player -- or team -- is left standing as the winner!</p>\n<p>'Race' for 1 player</p>\n<p>No ball in this one, just a race-track. Race 4 laps for the fastest overall time, or perhaps you're just trying for the best lap-time?</p>\n<p>The hi-scores and settings can be opened by clicking on the glowing logo in the menu.</p>\n<p>You can adjust the music and sound-effect balances, rebind the keys for each player, or do a 'factory reset' of all settings and hi-scores.</p>\n<p>Key-rebinding can be done by clicking one of the buttons (always labeled with the default keys for the player) and pressing the key you want for that player instead.</p>\n<p>The factory-reset can be set 'life' (the button becomes red) when clicking on it.</p>\n<p>If clicked on by accident, just disable it by clicking again.</p>\n<p>The actual factory-reset will be done when the button is active(/red) and you quit the settings-menu (back to the normal menu).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:11:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98c06c4ac2f91fd6daa3686fb7cdab0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["remco"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
