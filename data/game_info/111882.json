Spontaneity worked and almost all of the vanguard of the King perished. Luckily, along with the royal diligence, there was a Magician who created a barrier, fencing off the King from the horde of orcs. But the barrier will not last long. You are the one of the five elite warriors of the King - the paladin, who protects the King shoulder to shoulder with his brothers in arms. Use your unique sword \u2018Sunseeker\u2019 to save the King and replenish the power of the Magician, for if the barrier falls, death is inevitable. Can you protect the King from death, because Magician is running out of his magical power.</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<ul><li>LMB: on ground - Move</li><li>LMB: on enemy - Attack</li><li>RMB - Shield swing (fully restore Player\u2019s health and gain temporary attack damage boost)</li><li>Collect energy clots and bring them to the King to speed up his teleport or to the Magician to restore shield\u2019s strength and close opened rifts</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/091/09114011990bd4402e5e33fc6a13cbeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Surovyi"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
