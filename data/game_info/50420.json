They created real monsters to do DEATH BATTLES!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTwo modes, three types of cars, opponents from all over the Internet. Fight for yourself or join a suicide team to be killed by an enemy base.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Morally outdated graphics and effects, lack of a chat - nothing should distract a stalker from the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- The awkward interface will create additional challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Unique technology to capture the movement of an eye. Interact with interfaces with your own eyes!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- An unique psychological test that selects opponents and teammates. Tired of playing with people not your level? Play only with your own.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Three types of floating cars, each has its own role on the battlefield, but all equally useless - no discrimination.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- A special physics of floating, which can cause both love and hatred.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Respawn will restore the car after an imminent death; fight up to the last second or while the game does not freeze.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Earn points to improve cars right in the process of battle, - almost a legalized cheat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Collect artifacts to speed up the victory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Absence of pay-to-win, you can not get a victory with money, but for the sake of unique appearance, you can make donations so that the authors can buy positive reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Make a feasible contribution through Workshop, creating your own objects, characters, machines and whole game modes on Unreal 4.
