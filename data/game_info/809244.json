Each wants to make different genres of music and can\u2019t compromise. The protagonist, Sola, must break out of her stoic and passive role within the band to fight to keep the group together. She seeks out a jam battle with her friend-turned-opponent in which she attempts to blend her preferred genre of music with her adversary's in order to prove that compromise is possible.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Jaden (computeruser): Programming, Design</p>\n<p>Eli (bardicrogue): Programming\r\n</p>\n<p>Charlee (liucharlee): Project Management, Design</p>\n<p>Eric (RiceRogue): Tech Art</p>\n<p>Beck (splet): Art, Design, Juice</p>\n<p>Eris\u00a0(erisalreadytaken): Art</p>\n<p>Munro (shiib): Sound, Art</p>\n<p>Rhyme Irizarry:\u00a0Music<br/></p>\n<p>Sawyer (sawybean):\u00a0Title screen music track</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T07:22:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc2/bc2b17004425cb4d9cceb68f5e13f2a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Munro", "RiceRogue", "bardicrogue", "liucharlee", "erisalreadytaken", "splet", "computeruser"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
