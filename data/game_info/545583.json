Play a variety of mini-games with your friends and end the game as the true victor! Just don't let the uncontrollable cart drive drive you insane!</p>\n<p>The game is currently <strong>work in progress</strong>. It features a <strong>\"Hold The Item\" </strong>game mode in which players must steal a croissant by bumping into each other. The winner is the team that has the croissant when the timer runs out. We will continue to develop the game and  include more mini-games to provide a more varied gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>To play, you can either host a room and give your friends your IP address for them to join, join a room your friend has created by putting in their IP, or creating a room just for your local network.</p>\n<p>Being a P2P multiplayer game, network conditions might not be the best, so please ensure that the host player is the one with the fastest machine and use a wired connection if available.</p>\n<p>Due to network tweaks we are still working on, the game will only be distributed from Windows during this time. Updates will come later.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>A</strong> - Turn left</li><li><strong>D</strong> - Turn right</li><li><strong>Space</strong> - Boost forward (backwards if cart is stuck)</li><li><strong>Mouse Drag</strong> - Rotates camera</li></ul>\n\r\nClassic Gamemode\r\n<p><strong>Smashcart Ultra</strong> was first made for the <strong>GMTK Game Jam 2020</strong>.
