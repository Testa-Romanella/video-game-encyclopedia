We spent few more days after the event to tweak some stuff and make it playable ;)</p>\n<p>The core gameplay is inspired by many \"clicker\" games, but there is a small twist. Instead of playing for many days, weeks or months, the session ends in exactly 5 minutes. When the time is up, you can try again and beat your top score.</p>\n<p>The team:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Jan Ilavsky - https://twitter.com/Split82/</li><li>Vladimir Hrincar -\u00a0https://twitter.com/lokimansk</li><li>Peter Hrincar -\u00a0https://twitter.com/hrincarp</li><li>A.
