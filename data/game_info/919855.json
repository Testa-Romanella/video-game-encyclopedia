As Nigel's lawyer, it is your job to read the family will and accurately determine how his estate is distributed. Unfortunately, during the reading of the will, the Nyborgs received a surprise visit from another family (The Jacobs), who are demanding their fair share of the pie. Nigel's demands are that\u00a0his estate be divided fairly with his entire family.\u00a0Things went rapidly downhill from there.</p>\n<p>You've barricaded yourself in the study, hiding from two very angry, very demanding families. Can you accurately use notes within Nigel's study to piece together his history and all the family roots? Their inheritance (and consequently your life)\u00a0depends on it.</p><p><em>This game was made for GGJ 2023.
