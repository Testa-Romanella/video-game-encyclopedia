{"id": 162749, "slug": "viewport", "name": "Viewport", "name_original": "Viewport", "description": "<p>Viewport is a 2-to-4-player single-screen video game where players compete for control over the screen. Players begin selecting their textured sphere and an arena. Once the stage loads, the real fun begins when one of the players picks up the \"viewport\", making the screen move with respect to them, always keeping that sphere at the center. It is their objective to defeat other players by moving such that they fall out of view. If a character leaves the field of view, they die and their play for the match is over! Meanwhile, other players pick up power-ups and navigate the labyrinth to steal control over the viewport. Matches are intended to last anywhere from 10 minutes to 10 seconds!<br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>Character Select: CVBN</p><p>Level Select: arrows</p><p>C (player 1) -&gt; arrows</p><p>V (player 2) -&gt; WASD</p><p>B (player 3) -&gt; UHJK</p><p>N (player 4) -&gt; secondary numbers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jacksonekis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
