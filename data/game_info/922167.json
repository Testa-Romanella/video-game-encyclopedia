Having one arm\u00a0limits what you can carry, managing your inventory is vital to your survival.\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The bunker is home to a psychotic killer who will stalk the rooms searching for you. Armed with an axe he will hunt you down relentlessly, making you feel fear and tension every step of the way. Even if you find a hiding place it might not protect you.</p>\n\n<p>The bunker consists of multiple rooms, including the killer's personal collection of his victims' arms, explore areas such as the incinerator room where the killer disposes of the bodies,\u00a0the bedrooms for a short stay of his victims, the kitchen, the basement and a lot more. Each room contains the most sadistic traps - pressure plates, barb wire boxes, doors that lock themselves, levers, switches, items that require your blood to progress\u00a0and areas to hide. But don't hide forever, because you will bleed out.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>The multiple endings' aspect of the game allows you to find many ways to escape the bunker. Some of these endings require more than you were prepared for and can potentially stop you on your last step to freedom. Good endings, bad endings, secret endings, it's all out there for you to discover.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Munitum is being created by a small team and needs a lot of development time and effort to complete the project. The proof of concept that you can play right here showcases the potential of what Munitum will become, expanding on the bunker, more endings, items, unique puzzles,\u00a0new game modes, even new killers!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>W A S D - move</p>\n<p>E - interact / pick up items</p>\n<p>F - use certain items</p>\n<p>Q - drop selected item</p>\n<p>1 2 3 - select inventory items</p>\n<p>The fire stops the bleeding</p>\n\n<p>Share this with your friends and follow us on social media!</p>\n<p>The developers:\r\n</p>\n<p>Vidas:\u00a0https://twitter.com/VidasSalavejus\r\n</p>\n<p>Aaron:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Trial_by_Fir3\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone supporting indie horror games, we appreciate you!</p>\n<p>INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN - SUPPORT HERE https://igg.me/at/munitum<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T04:16:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/589b589ec137f1a8abc046b1e4e17ac0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vidas Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
