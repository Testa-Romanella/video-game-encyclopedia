Their fierce goblin king waits for you in the final chamber, tapping his foot to your inevitable demise! Each combat encounter is a randomly strung-together set of musical phrases, giving you a fresh challenge every time.</p>\n<p>Red sword notes will do damage to your enemy, while blue shield notes protect you from enemy attacks,\u00a0but only if you tap them in time! Use your keyboard (D,\u00a0F, J, and K) to do the deadly dance!</p>\n<p>Press escape at any time to exit the game.</p>\n<p>The current build has four playable classes, but be aware that nothing is balanced. It's very possible your adventure may be far too easy or far too hard using anything other than Fighter, right now.</p>\n<p>Eventually, this prototype will include procedural dungeon generation with multiple paths, loot to collect, a vast array of enemies, and original music.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I do not own the rights to the music currently utilized in this demo.
