The spider who works (unofficially) at the theater wants people to enjoy their viewing experience. He hangs from the ceiling watching the patrons as they watch the movies. If they are hungry or thirsty, he's got them covered. But if they take out\u00a0 a phone, he gets mad and \"escorts\" them out.</p>\n<p>Also, don't bother with Jamie from the concession stand. He's \"on break\" right now.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to crawl along the ceiling that you are hanging from.</p>\n<p>Use SPACE to drop down and check for phones or grab concessions.</p>\n<p>The game has 3 stages, and gets progressively harder.</p>\n\n<p>Programmer and all around cool person - Thomas Lucas</p>\n<p>Lead Artist/Sound Design\u00a0- John Gabriel</p>\n<p>Art/Sound\u00a0Design/Management - Trevor Shaw</p>\n<p>Additional sounds from Zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0Joel Stuedler</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T08:20:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41d6d3a710f2c7e6e36031939baba7a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squadopus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
