Inhabited by only the hardiest of sorceresses. But there's only room for one EdgeLord!<br/><br/><strong>EdgeLords </strong>is a boss-rush strategy card game with card battler and deck-building elements, where two sorceresses fling spells at one another and summon minions to fight for dominance.<br/><br/>A totally unique take on the <strong>deck-building</strong> genre, with hundreds of cards to discover and play! As well as <strong>climax powers</strong> that unleash devastating abilities!<br/><br/>Enjoy a<strong> fully voiced and animated</strong> hentai animation for every opponent you defeat on your path to total supremacy as you harvest their 'essence' and turn them into subservient thralls draped around the Edge Lord throne.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Death. Doom. Destruction. All will fall before her Dark Legion as she instigates the apocalypse and ends the world. <strong>Deathgrip</strong> is a gothic duluhan and her signature attack <strong>Reaper's Blade</strong>, which gains a Soul Gem card each time its played.<br/><br/><br/>Under the hidden grove, deep within the tree of life lies the fountain where Melonie, the love fairy can be found. Her volumptious body is irresistable, giving her opponent's decks <strong>Temptation</strong> cards that are often too good to turn down.<br/><br/><br/>The most powerful warlock in the realm. <strong>Ashka</strong> is an arrogant, smug brat. Her spells are devastating, especially <strong>Concussive Blast</strong> - each time its played, its damage increases!<br/><br/><br/>Emerging from the flaming portal in the forbidden woods, <strong>Lilith</strong> is an assassin sent from the demon realm to claim the title of Lord.
