Players must navigate this strange world and solve puzzles in order to try and get back to their realm. Along the way players learn new things about the world and the characters that inhabit it through the choices they make. The game\u2019s interactivity was designed to show players that life isn\u2019t always about the destination but rather the journey we take to get there through the use of diverging and crossing paths. It seeks to immerse the players in the world through the use of music and \u201cdescriptively vague imagery\u201d. Labyrinth describes the world and characters with enough detail to draw the readers in but keeps it vague enough so that players can use their imagination to fill in the gaps to keep them engaged.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Design and Development by Ashley Torosian\r\n</p>\n<p>Website: ashleytorosian.com\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This game uses these sounds from pixabay:\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAncient Wind\u201d by HarumachiMusic (https://pixabay.com/music/main-title-ancient-wind-112528/)\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cCloud of Sorrow\u201d by Katzen Tupas (https://pixabay.com/music/beautiful-plays-cloud-of-sorrow-13984/\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Hiding Place in the Forest\" by geoffharvey (https://pixabay.com/music/fantasy-dreamy-childrens-hiding-place-in-the-forest-111724/)\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cMysterious Celesta\u201d by Ashot-Danielyan-Composer (https://pixabay.com/music/mystery-mysterious-celesta-114064/)\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSands of Time\u201d by Juan Sanchez (https://pixabay.com/music/modern-classical-sands-of-time-113056/)\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThe White Lion\u201d by GuilhermeBernardes (https://pixabay.com/music/main-title-the-white-lion-10379/)\r\n\u201cWhich Path to Take?\u201d by geoffharvey (https://pixabay.com/music/main-title-which-path-to-take-122117/) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T11:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/466/466219c8a20bcd0153707cdf31990225.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["torosiandesigns"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
