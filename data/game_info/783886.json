A lone bus, a terrible crash, out upon the old and winding dirt roads which skirt a vast American wilderness. A survivor. A young woman, her mind scarred by a life of tragedy, her name is Alicia. She is alone. She is injured. Around her, quietly, slowly, a surreal and deadly nightmare unfolds.\n<br/><br/>\nFighting for her life, Alicia finds herself in the midst of events she does not understand- a \"change\" taking grip on the world around her.
