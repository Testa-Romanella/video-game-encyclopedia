If you manage to survive the level will change and will be harder, if you want to win you have to survive the three levels available. <br/>You are the little triangle and will die in just 1 one shot, avoid the circles and the squares! You have to kill at least something every 2 seconds if you don't want to lose. </p><p>On the left you there is a Dec counter, it's a timer about how long you survived in the level. </p><p>On the right there is a Bin counter, it's a timer and it last 2 seconds, you will see it in binary so: <br/>0 = 00 <br/>1 = 01 <br/>2 = 10 </p><p>The bin counter should not be 10-&gt;2 seconds because you will lose, to restart the timer just kill something. </p><p>To move use WASD and to shoot use the mouse :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dda/ddaab603345555428432702fbe797f29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DanteZack93"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
