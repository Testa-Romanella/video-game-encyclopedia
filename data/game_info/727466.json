The building is in a rather deplorable state, which, of course, is rather bad, but it\u2019s much more fun to play this way, because what\u2019s the interest in running around a deserted room where nothing can fall on your head and you won\u2019t be able to twist your leg anywhere?<br/><br/>In order to more strongly feel the role of the protagonist, the game is implemented in high-end graphics, and fire particles are barely distinguishable from a blazing PC in real life!<br/><br/>In general, there is no more time to explain. It's time to run and save your life from the fate of being fried to a crisp!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T04:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bde1ee57ae37e34ec7fc1a15f23de66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
