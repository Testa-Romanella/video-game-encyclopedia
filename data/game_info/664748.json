Fortunately, the cursed crown -not so cursed at this point - \u00a0makes him a completely\u00a0different man.</em></strong></p>\n<p>In fact, when the crown is placed on the king's head, all dummies follow his direction during a specific timelapse.</p>\n<p>In order to do it, use the <strong>directional arrows</strong> on your controller to rule them and make them go left, right, up or down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-The dummies -</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>At first cute-looking but absolutely excitable! Fortunately, once again, the cursed crown has the ability to create good soldiers out of them but... Well, this point is up to you...</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0A battle starts when at least one\u00a0of your dummies enter at least one of the opposing dummies' range. The numerical majority wins the fight. If there is a dummy duel (1vs1) and none of them are joined by another dummy after a certain time, the winner is randomly selected!</p>\n<p>\u00a0When the crown is placed on the head of a dummy, it can release a battlecry that groups all nearby dummies - allies and enemies - towards it. In order to do it, move your dummy with the <strong>left\u00a0</strong><strong>joystick </strong>\u00a0and release your battlecry with the <strong>B or \u25ef button</strong>!</p>\n<br/>\n<ul><li><strong>Franci ALGERA</strong> - Developper\r\n</li><li><strong>Liam ALLIAUME-DESNOUES </strong>- Producer\r\n</li><li><strong>C\u00e9dric CHAUVIN </strong>- Developper\r\n</li><li><strong>Tamara DIMOVSKI </strong>- Pixel Artist &amp; Graphic Designer\r\n</li><li><strong>William FILIPE </strong>- Game Designer &amp; Support Artist\r\n</li><li><strong>Vincent PARVILLIER </strong>- Game Designer\r\n</li><li><strong>Tinah RANARISON </strong>- Producer &amp; Sound Designer\r\n</li><li><strong>Thomas SAMPER </strong>- Developper\r\n</li><li><strong>L\u00e9opold WALHO\u00a0</strong>- Pixel Artist &amp; Graphic Designer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:49:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6a/c6ad36737fd1657dff5d78439919598c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cedric-chauvin", "joyzee", "William FILIPE", "hinikyuu", "Franci_Algera", "thomas-samper", "LeBeav", "L\u00e9opold Walho", "Miam91"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
