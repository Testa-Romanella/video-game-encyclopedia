Thank you for playing! :)\r\n\n\r\nDescription\r\n<p>Robo Rewind is a game where your main goal is to guide the robot to the locked door. Before you reach the locked door however, you'll need to guide the robot to the key first. You will need to use various objects such as springs, boxes, platforms and blocks to move the robot as he can only move left and right! The robot also has the ability to rewind time - this does not affect the environment, and only the robot will be affected by the reverse of time! Use this to your advantage!\u00a0Avoid any spikes and evil robots, and complete each level within the target time to receive a 3-star rating.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Left mouse button -\u00a0</strong>Menu/button interaction, place objects.</li><li><strong>Right mouse button -\u00a0</strong>Cancel object placement/Remove placed objects</li><li><strong>Middle mouse button (hold) and move mouse\u00a0-\u00a0</strong>Pan camera</li><li><strong>Space (hold) -\u00a0</strong>Rewind time</li><li><strong>R -\u00a0</strong>Restart level</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Pixel Frog\u00a0- for his background asset.</li><li>Vimlark\u00a0<strong>-\u00a0</strong>for the inspiration to make this game.</li><li>Livingroomclassics\u00a0<strong>-\u00a0</strong>for his background music loop.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:18:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/381dd9f007e591cbfd86025659b732ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Harrington"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
