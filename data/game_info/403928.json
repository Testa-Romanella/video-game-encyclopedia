You start with 100 hp, the enemy attacks periodically. You need to determine the enemy's weakness and kill them.

I learned a lot from this. Basic music theory (which I didn't apply well because I couldn't make a reasonable song in a reasonable time), sprite based artwork, animation, working with a limited palette, how to theme the UI in godot, how to create a project in godot, gdscript, audio streams, basically just how to use the engine.</p>\n<p>I look forward to my next project, which should be a massive improvement.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:23:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/923/9236b7f3f73f6b709b8dd43b712fa260.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["aloehart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
