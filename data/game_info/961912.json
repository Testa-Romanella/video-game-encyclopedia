It is not perfect indeed, but hopes to become a part of your memories of video games.<h3>Control</h3><br/>A/D: Move left/right.<br/><br/>Space: Jump.<br/><br/>Q/E\uff1aRotate the global gravity clockwise/counter clockwise, 90 degrees for each time. You can not change it again until it finishes doing so. <br/><br/>Esc: Pause;<h3>Levels</h3><br/>The game consists of 5 chapters and 14 levels. You will be faced of multiple obstacles too. <br/><br/><br/><br/>1. Simple gravity item<br/><br/>Some items' gravity directions would also change as the global gravity changes, but some would not.  They have their unique gravity. <br/><br/><br/><br/>2. Single pendulum<br/><br/>Single pendulum is an anchor, connected to a \"simple gravity item\" by a cable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3. Gravity converter<br/><br/>In charpter 3, the player would not be allowed to change gravity at any time, you can only change it when touching the \"gravity converter\".<br/><br/><br/><br/>4. The fan<br/><br/>The big fan would be continuesly rotating slowly, blocking the items when contacting them. <br/><br/><br/><br/>5. Diseased cells<br/><br/>Diseased cells and harmful to healthy ones. When a health cell contacts a diseased one, it would get illed and die. So make sure to avoid them in any case. <br/><br/><h3>Additional notes</h3><br/>1. No solution<br/><br/>If an obstacle is stucked in a channel especially which would lead to the exit, you could consider loading the last check point. This would reload the whole level. <br/><br/>2. Adjusting resolution in fullscreen mode causes the app to flicker or stutter<br/><br/>Maybe it is because you have installed NVIDIA Game Ready Driver 461.09 or newer. You could find solutions in NVIDIA SUPPORT.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T03:26:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b4/6b41272b405b40370238bc64d7b54ec7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YUZHU PRODUCTIONS"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["YUZHU PRODUCTIONS"], "esrb_rating": null}
