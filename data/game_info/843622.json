{"id": 843622, "slug": "a-blip-through-reality", "name": "A blip through reality", "name_original": "A blip through reality", "description": "<p>We all dream at night. We all dream of happiness, and sadness, sometimes we even have nightmares. In a blip through reality, you follow Bella, a lonely, bullied young girl. Every night when Bella comes home she puts a smile on her face, not only because she wants her mother to think she's happy, but also because she is excited to see Blip, her dreamy, imaginary, pixelated friend that guides her through the multiverse while she is asleep at night. While Bella doesn't find much enjoyment in other kids at school, she's not alone. She's got Blip. And as they continue on their journey through realities they will find out that they are even less alone than they were before.</p>\n<p>Play as Blip and guide young Bella through the multiverse, in this small platformer game. Maybe you'll even uncover the secrets of Blip Reality Labs!</p>\n\n<p>This game is nowhere near finished. So far, the game is just a bunch of my ideas (which I\u00a0do think are good) thrown together into a playable game before the jam deadline. I do hope to be able to slowly work on and improve this game into what I truly believe it can be. My goal is to have each level be either a different genre of game or a different art style, representing Bella's different and unique dreams of Blip each night. Anyways, go play the game already (or don't.. i mean it's not very good)</p>\n\n\n<p>Credit:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music from Free Music Archive</p>\n<p>Stock footage from Pexels</p>\n<p>Vehicle from Warped Vehicles by ansimuz</p>\n<p>Lab Tileset: https://exceptrea.itch.io/2d-platformer-tileset-laboratory</p>\n<p>Blip, textboxes, and platforms (from the first level) were all made by me in Aseprite.</p>\n<p>I would have loved to make all of this stuff myself, but I've been busy with lots of stuff in real life, and this is my first game jam, so I'm happy to just have a project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T13:53:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d89/d89518800504676cabd02e4e5a9b17c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["tigerboy3050"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
