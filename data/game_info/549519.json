Shoot enemies to teleport to where they were in their final moments! To complete each level, you must kill all enemies and leave through the door at the top of the screen.\u00a0 Collect powered up arrows to give your attacks an extra edge when it comes to dealing with particularly resilient enemies and devious obstacles!</p>\n<p><strong>===================================</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>[W][A][S][D] keys to move</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to fire</p>\n<p>[R] to restart</p>\n<p>===================================\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was made for Mini Jam 72. The theme was \"Adventure\", the limitation was \"Death must be a core mechanic\" and it all had to be done in under 72 hours!\u00a0I\u00a0decided to interpret that as making enemy deaths a resource that you had to carefully use at the proper times - because once they are dead, you can no longer use them as a movement option.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a solo effort and all graphics and code were made during the game jam's time period. Unfortunately I\u00a0did not have time to include music as well, but the few notable sound effects are from this sound effect pack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T10:06:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80b/80b7f87fc401f2938467525c8b565614.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fiddlebog"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
