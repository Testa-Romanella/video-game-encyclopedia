I have bigger plans for this game, and one day they will manifest in a new game, but for now, enjoy what there is here. It's not great, but it's okay.<br/></p><p>We were told to make a game using the school's (as of now) proprietary game engine slash editor, Zero. Zero lets you use sprites and models. I chose to use neither, and create everything in the game exclusively using Zero's \"draw debug line\" functions. To do this, I had to create my own system of drawing \"vector sprites\" (collections of lines) to the screen. And I had to work out 3D perspective stuff.</p><p>The menus in this game might be the best menus I've ever done. I really like the way they feel. They could be better though, and they will be in the \"real\" version of this game, once I make it.</p><p>Anyways, the game is pretty self-explanatory. Play the tutorial and then play the game. There isn't a ton of content here, but what there is at least kind of impressive for one guy to make in five weeks while also attending school, I hope.</p><p>Special thanks to <strong>Spencer Mauro</strong> for helping me think through design concepts and create breakbeats, and to <strong>Juli Gregg</strong> for helping me understand 3D perspective projection math.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43fb71098e47e0f9fc38083a9bda394e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Rezich"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
