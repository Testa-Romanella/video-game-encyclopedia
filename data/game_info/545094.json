You can shoot their corpses to make them disappear if you're going for a \"human-free diet\"<br/></li><li> Every six levels, you will have a chance to collect ammo. But over time, there will be less ammo to collect<br/></li><li> There are three different endings. Did you find them all?<br/></li><li> The game saves automatically on every ammo gathering stage. So you can continue your game from the last ammo stage you visited.</li></ul><br/>Please note: This game is loosely based on the legend of Caramuru, but it doesn't follow the story too closely", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T02:52:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08dc4a322acb0948efd355dbf09bfeeb.jpg", "website": "https://wholetonegames.blogspot.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wholetone Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wholetone Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
