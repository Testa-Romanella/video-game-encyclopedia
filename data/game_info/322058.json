Shoot bullets!\u00a0\"Last Neko\" follows the story of the last catboy in a world where catgirls and catboys have been enslaved or slaughtered\u00a0since a long time under the martial law of the Half-Dog Empire. You play as Katz, the last of his kind, a catboy kid who wants to prove he has the right to exist. And maybe to save the remaining catboys and catgirls along the way.</p>\r\nLast Neko features:\r\n<ul><li>Six levels of fast-paced action!</li><li>Six challenging boss battles!</li><li>Challenge and almost no dead time!\u00a0If a moment is quiet, it is not really quiet!</li><li>Retro pixel art design, mostly made with the palette of the good old NES!</li><li>Chiptune soundtrack, made of 10 tracks!</li><li>A catboy who pew pew pew!</li></ul>\r\nLast Neko does not feature:\r\n<ul><li>Skill trees. The game is based on your skill and only on your skill!</li><li>Grind. You will probably die, retry, die and retry again. That's fine! That's how things are working with danmaku! Learn the patterns and feel your skill improve along the runs!</li><li>Complicated gameplay with tons of stuff to upgrade. Shoot, drop bombs, move forward!The only thing to upgrade is the knowledge of the game!</li><li>Royalty-free and third party assets. Everything has been done by one developer and handcrafter with love!</li><li>Fake difficulty. I worked the game design and iterated it a lof of times in order to avoid to do what you shouldn't do when you develop a danmaku. <em>(that includes : color contrast between background and bullets, bonus drops hiding bullets, and stuff like that).</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\r\nSelf-confidence is the key\r\n\n\n\r\nStuck? No problem, here comes the bomb!\r\n\n\r\nLast Neko has been done with:\r\n<ul><li>Unity3d</li><li>Microsoft Visual Studio (langage C#)</li><li>FL Studio</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Aseprite</li><li>A lot of coffee and a lot of\u00a0pizzas.</li></ul>\n\n\r\nDodge this and that!\r\n\n\r\nNote from le dev!\r\n<p>In the beginning, \"Last Neko\" was called \"Neko Shooter\". I am actually making this game for a game jam. Since this is my first game jam, it's kind of a challenge to me. I have to do a lot of stuff in very few time. And to top it off, this is the first time I am making a shoot'em up. And this is also the first time I am using Unity3d without a tutorial. So, no matter what comes out from this game, it is helping me to improve a lot! The goal is to make a game within three weeks, and since I'm happy with the results so far, I will surely be tempted to make a sequel, with more time to use,\u00a0with more refined graphics!</p>\r\nDid you know?\r\n<p><em>I slghtly modified the plot of the game just after what happened in\u00a0Alebama in order to protest.</em></p>\n<p>Frelon-K</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/201/2014aa8e1d3f11817cb24616c32e7504.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Frelon-K Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
