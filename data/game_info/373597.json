{"id": 373597, "slug": "elysion", "name": "ELYSION", "name_original": "ELYSION", "description": "<h3>STORY</h3>The end of the Interstellar War left the planet of Arcadia in ruins.<br/><br/>But just when the world began to see peace and stability, the \"Auto Drones\" went berserk and brought destruction to the lands. \"Sion Obsidias\" will pilot the high-tech aerial combat device, the \"Valkyrie\", to fight against the Auto Drones and restore peace to the world.<h3>CONSEPT</h3>ELYSION is a game that combines 2D Anime girls, the military and Sci-fi. Even though it's a shooting game, it is a story-driven game with over 15,000 characters of dialogue. It is a side-scroller Sci-fi shooting game with high resolution chibi characters that move fluidly across the screen!<h3>GAMESYSTEM</h3>We were able to add new elements into an established genre that is shooting games. <br/><br/><br/>\u30fbBombs, options, \"slow speed mode\" and the grazing system are all elements we have incorporated from well-known Doujin shooting games. During \"slow speed mode\", dual-firing the machine gun and gattling gun will increase their damage. <br/><br/>\u30fbIncorporating a \"HP Bar\", which is pretty rare for classical shooting games. HP can be recovered via the use of items. <br/><br/>\u30fbStandard shots have a spreading effect. The further you are to the enemy, the weaker the damage. Enemies drop score-up items when you defeat them quickly. The key to scoring high is to fight close range while avoiding enemy attacks. <br/><br/>\u30fbGamepad support is implemented for players who want more precise control over their character. <br/><br/>\u30fbIncludes cute animated cut scenes for bomb explosions. This might mess with your focus, but for this instance, we prioritized pretty girls over the fluidity.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T03:23:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e4/2e45bc22d54cbaa2dffe40ce0f5d5e2b.jpg", "website": "http://ronin.site/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RONIN GAMES"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RONIN GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
