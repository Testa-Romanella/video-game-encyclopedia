Only started the initial talks. Might entirely scrap later, but I\u00a0like the idea of throwing a party to try to invite two rivals for how stupid it is. Currently, there are two Objectives:\u00a0Find a cake (likely through Payne) and find party games (no clue who). End of the quest would probably be the characters still not showing up, because they're not part of Art Fight. Ends with them screaming at the screen to add their rivals to Art Fight? (Richie comes in at the end too, talking about his Best Friend, WHO WAS REMOVED. OH NO).</p>\n<p><strong>Completed Quests:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>When Life Gives you Lemons...\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0 Very quick quest that consists of merely talking to Lemonsworth with Zane once. He receives a lemon from him, but only because Lemonsworth finds him unstable.</p>\n<p><strong>Added Dialogue:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Bard Band:</strong>\u00a0Added Echidna as a member.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Everyone Gang:\u00a0</strong>Added Echidna, Typhon, Lemonsworth,\u00a0Jean, and Ruby as members. (Seven down, thirty to go?\u00a0Why do I do this to myself?)\u00a0Jean\u00a0<em>should</em>\u00a0be able to join from any of his three spots, but hopefully it doesn't mess with the other dialogue anywhere. Sometimes, other dialogue will trigger first, like the puppet quest.</p>\n<p>-<strong>\u00a0Zane/Jean Equipment:</strong>\u00a0Took out the possibility of finding a lawyer to sue Jean because Jean is in so many other places already and it'd be hard to keep track of. Instead, Zane threatens to sue and if he spoke to Susan, he'll mention Susan by name. Either way, Jean returns the equipment. Tried to add the equipment thing to all the different Jeans as well except the one in the front of the inn, but I\u00a0didn't heavily playtest it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Glitches:</strong></p>\n<p>&gt;\u00a0Need to create a Quest icon for the Seth Quest (thinking about having two people).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>X: Open Menu / Cancel\u00a0</p>\n<p>Z:\u00a0Interact / Advance Text</p>\n<p>SHIFT: Dash / Fast Forward Text</p>\n<p>Q: Open Quest Log</p>\n<p>CONTROL:\u00a0Switch Party, once unlocked (only in areas both parties can reach.
