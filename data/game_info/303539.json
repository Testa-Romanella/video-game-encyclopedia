Watch out for the swatter while you mate with your friends to keep your fly family alive. Down to Fly is a one vs. six game about mating and the circle of life. Player one controls the fly swatter using the control stick and can swat with any of the triggers or bumpers. Holding down the trigger or bumpers will hide the shadow of the fly swatter. The other three controllers can be shared or used alone and each control stick controls a different fly. When two flies touch they mate and will respawn any dead flies or make an egg that will let flies respawn when they die.</p>\n<p>Down to Fly was made in three days for TrainJam 2019 and shown off at GDC 2019. The theme was circuitous.</p>\n<p>Art\u00a0and Development<br/>Anthony Tesija</p>\n<p>Design<br/>Anthony Tesija<br/>Josie Brechner<br/></p>\n<p>Music and Sounds<br/>Josie Brechner<br/></p>\n<p>Writing<br/>Kiki Maynard<br/>Anthony Tesija</p>\n<p>Voice Acting<br/>Josie Brechner<br/>Gwen Guo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:49:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f08/f08645faaef346eb184a32a55c11fd5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Tesija"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
