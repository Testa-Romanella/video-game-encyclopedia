Avoid hitting the sides or any of the cube debris, and try to land on the platforms. Dodge attacks from the bosses and aim your mouse at them and spam left click to shoot them. Killing bosses will give you points, and surviving during events will increase your score/second. After each time you die, you will get XP and gold depending on your score. Use these to unlock new guns to kill bosses with. Each time you fight a new boss for the first time, it will be unlocked in your notebook, in the main menu. Use your notebook to find more information about your enemies and tips on how to fight them.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Jump: spacebar</p>\n<p>Move left and right: a, d</p>\n<p>Add downforce: right click</p>\n<p>Shoot: left click</p>\n\n<p>STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND MANY THINGS STILL DO NOT WORK PROPERLY.
