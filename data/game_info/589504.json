The downside is your color vision is gone, forcing you to see the world in a more primal way.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD keys to move (Recommended).</li><li>Arrow keys to move</li><li>Space to slide (invincible while sliding).</li><li>Click to attack</li><li>Mouse to aim</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game Jam Themes:</strong></p>\n<p>This project was made for both the Black and White Game Jam and the Bullet Hell Jam.</p>\n<ul><li>The Bullet Hell Jam Theme was \"10 seconds\", so the weapon in this has 10 seconds in which it's power is incredibly upgraded.</li><li>The Black and White Jam theme was \"You will only miss it when it is gone\". Since every level starts with having the ability going, it can be very tricky to get it back if it is lost.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Play in full screen.</li><li>You are invincible while sliding, use this to get out of tough situations quickly.</li><li>The largest enemy has 6,000 hit points and takes 30 hits to go down. You may want to keep other enemies alive incase your ability gets too low.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Music by Nicolas Jeudy from \"Immortals\"</p>\n<p>Everything else\u00a0by IanGoGo<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:32:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62f/62f36adf450c7b3c3390055bb00af470.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IanGoGo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
