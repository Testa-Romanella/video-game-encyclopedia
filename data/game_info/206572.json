There is a type of gaming - you can play at different levels of difficulty or just engage in free hunting. The app looks for \"backside\" in jeans, shorts, panties or... hmm... boobs :-)<br/></p>\n<p>This is an experimental application. I'm exploring the possibilities for gaming the computer vision systems and wondering if they have a future in this area. The application uses OpenCV and Haar cascades. I gather a team for the development of the project (write to facebook or comment).<br/></p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions or questions, please let me know in the comment.<br/></p>\n<p>Facebook -\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/nyanhuntapp/<br/></p>\n<p>Any donations would be appreciated to help with the development of the project.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/60289520520626281f0d934e359a8790.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Walter Fragg"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
