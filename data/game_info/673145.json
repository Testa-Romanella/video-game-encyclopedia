{"id": 673145, "slug": "unscrambler", "name": "Unscrambler", "name_original": "Unscrambler", "description": "<p><strong>Unscrambler</strong> is a word puzzler where you're tasked to reconstruct a scrambled word. The original word is broken into <strong>chemical element</strong> symbols which are then provided to you shuffled. Just order these back to the correct word (or any other word) and you'll be given some points.</p>\n<p>Sounds simple enough? Well, sometimes the given symbols are jumbled even further and you must combine two or more elements to form new ones with some basic\u00a0<strong>maths</strong>!</p>\n<p>If you don't use all the provided symbols, you will lose one life for each unused one. And when you run out of lives, as you might have guessed, the game is over. So be precise (and fast for the multiplier) to score big and claim your place on the <strong>leaderboards</strong>.</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 49 with the theme of Unstable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/4347c8c5715db1a19b5a2fb90c20f537.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["anttihaavikko"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
