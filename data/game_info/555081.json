I made all assets during game jam except for sound effects and music. Since this is my first jam submission (and also the only complete game I've ever made) I didn't have enough time to add more levels or expand on the main mechanics idea. A lot of things should be improved. If you liked the idea, feel free to use or expand it (just let me know please).<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this game.<br/></p>How to Play<p>It's a turn-based fight, in each turn you'll choose 3 words to form a curse. Each word will have a damage and your turn's damage is sum of all 3 words' damages. Choosing words that start with the same letter will give you damage multiplier (it'll multiply turn's damage by 2 or 3 depending on number of words that start with the same letter). See instructions page in game for more details.<br/><br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Start Menu Music By: http://soundcloud.com/rezoner</p>\n<p>Battle Music By: Alexandr Zhelanov https://soundcloud.com/alexandr-zhelanov</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:08:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e1759fe54e0d5822ab6a9934e74e1493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Saadin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
