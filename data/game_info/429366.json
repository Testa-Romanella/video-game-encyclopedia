Like most dwarves, Korzians were diggers and treasure collectors. Alas, one day, the korzians dug too deep into the mountain, and let grues, terrible creatures of darkness that feed on anything that isn\u2019t one of their own, enter their city, forcing the dwarves to flee.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>But grue eggs are precious things, and so you decided to go back to the korz\u2019 ruins\u00a0 in order to get some. Be wary though, as your torch will only last so long.</p>\n\n<p>Goal:</p>\n<p>get the eggs to gain points. Your torch will run out as you move, but you can find more torches that the dwarves left behind. You must get through 4 levels and find the elevator that the dwarves left\u00a0 downstairs to exit.<br/>You'll have 10 steps after your torch stops bruning before being eaten by a grue.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n\n<p>Programmer: Taewyth<br/>Music: Gloradur<br/>Art: Litanas<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:24:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/225/225970fdca195597d389c57958e490fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Team Nostra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
