I originally built it for Windows, so please keep that in mind.</strong></p>\n\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p>The goal is to either remove all enemy pawns or find the chest with gold! This game is meant to be played with two players on one screen.</p>\n<p>Left-Click to chose a pawn and tile to move to. <br/>Right-Click and drag (or WASD keys) to move the camera.</p>\n<p>When you start, you have to place three pawns on the first row of the board and then click the 'OK' button in the top right corner. This will start the game.</p>\n<p>You can only move forwards and one big step backwards. <br/>To attack an enemy's pawn or open a chest, you have to strike backwards.</p>\n<p>EXTRA INFORMATION</p>\n<p>I made this in &lt;72h for the Ludum Dare 38 Jam.</p>\n<p>Used programs:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity3D</li><li>Blender</li><li>Photoshop</li><li>Audacity</li></ul>\n<p>None of the sound effects or music tracks are made by me:<br/>Main menu music: Analog Nostalgia - soundimage.org<br/>Ingame music: Bedtime Story - soundimage.org</p>\n<p>ChestOpen sound: https://www.freesound.org/s/202092/<br/>Explosion sound: https://www.freesound.org/s/155235/<br/>Win sound: https://www.freesound.org/s/215773/<br/>HitPawn sound: https://www.freesound.org/s/339345/</p>\n<p> The tiles, the lamp, the character, the chests and the base of all UI elements are made by Kokonus.</p>\n<p>The only asset I downloaded from the Unity Asset store is the RTS Camera (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/43321)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c11/c116b5b8bd428ae3cfebf65fd9e66bf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Pixely Wixely"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
