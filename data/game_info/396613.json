I created the in-game narrative and scripted out the pickup system for it.</p><p>This project took roughly 8 weeks with 8 people. This game was made in the Unity Engine. The original inspiration was from the first Dead Space series, as is evident in the model of the main character. The most notable takeaway from this project was working on an interdisciplinary team for the first time in agile development. Clear communications and definitions of the terms we were using became vital for the success of the project, and were tested on a few occasions.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:16:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba799cc69f08fa713ab5bbeae42499b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steven Eirman"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
