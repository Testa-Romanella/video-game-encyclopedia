Command the armies of Man and Goblin as they battle for supremacy on battlefields across the lands of Arcwellion. Will you build a mighty kingdom and lead the armies of men to stand against the storm or will you command the goblin hordes in their quest for wealth and glory? <br/><br/>Victory in Goblin Storm requires more than force of arms. Gallant knights and fearsome trolls can smash enemies in open field battles, but even the most formidable foe may be lured to destruction into forest death traps or taken by surprised by an unseen horde. Out-wit and out-maneuver your opponent in fast paced, simultaneous turns that reward strategy and deception, more than brute force.
