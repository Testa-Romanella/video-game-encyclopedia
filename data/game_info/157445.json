Fisherman is about the short story of a doppelganger girl, who, along with her whole world,\u00a0is sentenced to the asylum\u00a0world of No-Kywln. No-Kywln is basically the Universe's garbage can,\u00a0which wears the mask of a clinic for worlds that go out of order. While there is some truth to that, it mainly acts as to keep the insane locked, usually until the Headmaster gives the order for a said world to be removed out of existence. It's too much work to bother, really...</p>\n<p>This is the fishboot edition! The game has been updated recently. Bugfixes and small life quality changes.</p>\n<p>If you have 15 minutes to kill, this is just the thing for you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47a/47acf8d7fb628a821d151425e0f91038.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlareEX"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
