Although the main\u00a0 protagonist isn't as supernatural as your average villain he still manages to cause a lot of trouble.\u00a0\u00a0 In this game you're on a mission to get everyone hooked on alcohol for the wrong reasons. If you fail the first time you may just be a bit more convincing the second time. I wont spoil a thing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/092/0920b04707b5ced2cc2ea3f356b0405c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crisos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
