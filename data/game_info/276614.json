Die beautifully. 72 weapons to get too. I am a lover of code breaking and the code here is one button to fire all 72, based on a 4 beat loop. Half and full beat hits trigger weapons, hit the off beat and it all turns off and you have to start again.</p>\n<p>Play the practice mode to start with as it has instructions. Once you have your head round it play the 1 player mode or challenge a friend.</p>\n<p>The theme was Sacrifices must be made. Each shot sacrifices HP - but you can get it back if you are canny.</p>\n<p>Enjoy<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/407/407984e44e160493e2071468cee0934b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheSoulSelector"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
