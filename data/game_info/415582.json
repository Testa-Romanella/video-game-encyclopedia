For now I figure the version I have may as well be playable to those that wish to play it.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>Left/Right Mousebutton</strong> for Left and Right punches, hold the button longer for a more more powerful punch, hold and release quickly for faster and less powerful shots.</p>\n<p>Guarding is automatic but will lower when you throw a shot, the more powerful the shot you throw means a longer delay in raising your guard. Taking punches when your guard is down will increase the damage taken, giving a counter-window opportunity.</p>\n<p>The lower your health and stamina is, the slower your health will recover and your chances of being rocked are much greater, being rocked will leave your guard open and will increase damage of incoming shots.</p>\n<p><strong>Press R</strong> to restart</p>\n<p><strong>Press SPACE</strong> to spawn in an opponent</p>\n<p><strong>Press CTRL</strong> to switch fps</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:00:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4ad95e73f41c98706b5907a9b76a205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["heavymaterial"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
