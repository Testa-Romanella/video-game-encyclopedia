You are one of the survivors living in this chaos. All you have to do is to grab your weapon and use your talents and skills to fight for either yourself, your country, your life or your honor in this horrible era. You either fight in this ruleless and status-less world to become a king to have all, or become no one to lose all.Features<strong>A great variety of mechs :</strong><br/>Besides normal mechs like automatic guns and cannon, we have a great variety of mechs such as Iron Thorn which attacks enemies by ramming the targets,  Shadow Warrior that attacks with laser, Shadow which changes itself like a chameleon, and also other 37 kinds of mechs for you to choose.<br/><br/><strong>A Unique evolutionary system :</strong><br/>Each first level mech evolves different ways to become second level mech. For example, you can choose Shadow Warrior, Mad Bull or Titan as the second-stage mech of Iron Thorn. Also, a second level mech evolves different ways to become a third level. Before you choose your mech, you can read a evolutionary map to help you make a decision.<br/><br/><strong>All-embracing skills :</strong><br/>Besides the skill you first require, you are free to add skills from the 27 skills on the list according to your points and devices to improve your skills.<br/><br/><strong>Plenty of characteristics :</strong><br/>Each mech has more than nine characteristics. It is difficult to choose a mech that suits you when you are with a limited amount of points. Don't be upset when you make the wrong decision. There's some special ways you can do to rearrange your points, so you don't need to use the same mechs several times to gain new skills.<br/><br/><strong>Set your own special battlefield :</strong><br/>You can create your own battlefield.
