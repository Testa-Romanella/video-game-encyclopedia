While coins are rich and have a great life, dices can't almost eat. Dicey must take a chance and go on a long trip to defeat the Coin King and save the dices from starvation.</p>\n\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Your journey will be in a random order caused by your uncontrolled rolling abilities - that means that you can start at any point, even defeating the final boss.</p><p>Jump on coins to kill them. When you have killed all coins, a flag will appear. Go there to finish the level. Get keys to open doors.<br/></p>\n<p>You'll know the controls in level 1 ;)</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming, graphics and music: Happy Wombat</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: Scratch library</p>\n<p>Tools: Scratch, Music Lab</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:11:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/35378f3609db4c5806456a6f7d3d66ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Happy Wombat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
