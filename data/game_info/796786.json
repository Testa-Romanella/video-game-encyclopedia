We created a puzzle-solving game experience combining novel gameplay with amazing art and music inspired by Tang and Tubo cultures.\r\n</p>\n<p>Back in the Tang dynasty, there were two Chinese princesses, Princess Jincheng and Princess Wencheng, who married to emperors of Tubo for diplomatic purposes. Even though they were living in different generations, they shared very similar fates because of the duty that they were given: maintaining the peace between two empires.\r\n</p>\n<p>We can\u2019t help but wonder, what if there is popular media, such as a game, that tells a story of such characters. This initial spark quickly became a game idea that we would like to work on for the semester. Note, however, that the game you see now is only a vertical slice of what\u2019s to come in the future where the full story of the princesses will be told.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Watch the trailer: https://youtu.be/Ocw3QiQvQF4\r\n</p>\n<p>Watch the full gameplay(spoiler): https://youtu.be/P8N2Gciwh7I\r\n</p>\n<p>Check our website: https://projects.etc.cmu.edu/unveil/\r\n</p>\n<p>For information and support, contact unveilstudio666@gmail.com\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Team:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuzhu Zhou (Producer/3D Character Artist)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tianyi Cao (Co-producer/Sound Designer)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rui Xi (Game Designer/Puzzle Designer/Programmer)\u00a0</p><p>Zhongyan Li (Level Designer)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shuxing Li (Programmer/Technical Artist)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kayi Ng (2D Artist)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anran Gong (Look Dev/3D Environment Artist/Lighting Artist)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Instructors:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dave Culyba\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ricardo Washington</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T15:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/053/053d89e34c09cfe10b5cd96223ed0f5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unveil2022"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
