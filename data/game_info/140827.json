Last weeks project showed that if its a really simple idea, it doesn't necessarily need an huge amount of time to get a prototype up and running.</p><p>For some reason I had the idea of toy trains in my head so decided to make a digital version of a toy train kit. It's not really a game, you just pootle around. It was really fun and leisurely to make. I think there's something there, but i'm sure there are already a billion digital train sets!</p><p>It's very simplistic but there is a lot of room for expansion and making more game-y. Right now you can pick up passengers at the station and alter the train speed. The passenger pick up is very rudimentary because I could see that if I started it would grow into quite bit task (multiple stations, tracking passenger numbers, boarding / alighting passengers, respawning passengers etc) so I left it as is.</p><p>Nice simple one this week :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b41/b41d2ae4b000fe901659d4c03729caca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HK UdP"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
