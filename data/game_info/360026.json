{"id": 360026, "slug": "momentum-itch-bearhunter", "name": "momentum (itch) (bearhunter)", "name_original": "momentum (itch) (bearhunter)", "description": "<p>momentum was built around the idea of navigating a role-playing world with only one button for every single action (save for the menu, but I might think of something for that, too). You follow a set path, only able to move in one direction, though there will be branching paths for exploration. For choices and combat, the game utilises a 'choice wheel' mechanic. As is roughly explored in this prototype, the wheel lets you choose between different conversation options, as you\u00a0 might expect from your typical RPG. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to get a combat encounter going, but the idea is the same. However, enemies can't directly hurt you: they will affect your wheel in negative ways, from messing up the speed so you miss your timing, or adding certain elements to the wheel that forces you to hurt yourself or your teammates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The story isn't exactly set in stone yet, but it will definitely tie in with the concept of not being fully in control of your choices, and that you're not able to go backwards.</p>\n<p>More a rough concept than a playable game at this stage, I still wanted to upload, if only so I\u00a0can try again next year and see how far I've come.</p><p>--</p><p>Music:<br/></p><p>Shady Dave</p><p>\"My Love\"</p><p>https://freesound.org/people/ShadyDave/sounds/325611/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:19:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecc/ecc31c94fc5ab4c9e15783175a94f658.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bearhunter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
