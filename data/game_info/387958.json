I wanted make a short narrative based on characters that I\u2019ve been working on developing for about a year now. I decided to do this because that way I\u2019d have a lot of the story ideas in my head already, and character artwork already done. That way I could focus more on learning the software, since I had never used Unity before. Since the story I was able to tell in this game cuts off pretty abruptly, I imagine this would be like a demo for a full length visual novel, if I ever were to make one.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Links to assets used:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Glasses Sprite</p>\n<p>https://www.pinterest.com/pin/432416001719475121/</p>\n<p>Forest Background 1\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://www.pexels.com/photo/green-tree-forest-880675/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Forest Background 2\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://www.pexels.com/photo/mossy-woods-1102911/</p>\n<p>Music\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxDVgEhZppk&amp;list=LLTCcvk3ebVOYegQr1yDQ-VQ&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s</p>\n<p>Heartbeat sound effect\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/485076/</p>\n<p>Footsteps sound effect\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/419052/</p>\n<p>Windchimes sound effect\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/fijiman/sounds/477437/</p>\n<p>Twig Snap sound effect\r\n  </p>\n<p>http://soundbible.com/48-Branch-Break.html\u00a0</p><p>Check out my portfolio here:\u00a0https://dariaboudreau.wixsite.com/portfolio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:55:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/613/6132b77ba18935e2af015367d1366855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["daria.boudreau"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
