The theme was\u00a0<em>what's hiding in the dark?</em></p>\n<p>Play as a ghost who must hide in the dark not to spook the guards and lose the game while still finding all the items on its adventure.</p>\n<p>For some godot reason, the html player does not work nicely with audio + transitions. For this reason, for superior audio experience, we suggest that you download the executables.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The player can move either with WASD or the arrows. When the scared-meter is full, it's game over (the player loses). Once the player clears the level\u00a0(i.e.\u00a0finds all the items), they can move to the next one.\u00a0</p>\r\nDevelopment Team\r\n<p><em>cat.astro</em> and <em>thoozee</em>.</p>\r\nTools\r\n<p>We used <em>Godot 3.5</em>, <em>Blender 3.3</em>, <em>Krita</em> and <em>GIMP 2.10</em>.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>For the locale executables, we must credit\u00a0Gonkee for the<em> fog shader for Godot 3.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T07:31:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7db/7db2fad07d49a24ba9272c6e4de8d542.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Thoozee", "cat.astro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
