The base games are two very simple 10liners contest entries (created by Matt B). Their DATA lines were replaced by RND entries. RANDOMIZE is used to be able to re-generate the same graphics eash time.<br/></p>\n<p>============================\r\n</p>\n<p>CSSCGC crap contest entry\r\n</p>\n<p>By Firelord Quality Games!\r\n</p>\n<p>* You will need a spectrum emulator to run this game!
