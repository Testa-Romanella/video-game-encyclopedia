Exploring an old theatre, you will be able to enter performances, replaying events of the past seen through the eye of an artist. Unveil the story hidden in the spectacles, where no detail is incidental.<br/><br/><h3>A nostalgic journey to the past</h3><br/>When they were young, the Actress and the Director were full of dreams and ambitions. Decades later, the Actress returns to the threatre, to once more become the performer, the audience and the muse.<br/>The spectacles, the letters, radio interviews - they are all meaningful, but will the Actress find what she's looking for? Attend the last show of a famous artist reflecting on his defining moments and your role in his life. <br/><br/><h3>Enjoy the variety in both artstyle and gameplay</h3><br/>With each spectacle you will explore a new, incredible scenography fully painted in VR. Each performance tells the story of different characters, with individual gameplay mechanics and a unique conclusion. Be it a robot escaping a factory or a little, conceited musketeer - every role you assume is an outlet for a specific message. Press on, as seemingly unrelated plots start to come together, creating a bigger picture. <br/><br/><h3>Painterly graphics made with innovative technologies</h3><br/>To separate the performances from the real world and stress their artistic nature, we decided to reach for new, creative methods of graphic design. The spectacle segments of the game are painted using virtual reality technology: exchanging traditional 3D modeling for painterly strokes and splatters granted us more expressive freedom in shaping the artistic vision of the Director.In <strong>Ars Fabulae</strong> you will experience:<br/><ul><li>A rich, engaging story about the relationship of two artists who developed a theatre in a British countryside.</li></ul><ul><li>Multiple chapters with different gameplay mechanics, telling individual stories tied to the main plot.</li></ul><ul><li>A unique art style created with VR painting technology.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T02:43:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de7/de737149858ad12b01256319b333981f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Punk Notion"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Punk Notion"], "esrb_rating": null}
