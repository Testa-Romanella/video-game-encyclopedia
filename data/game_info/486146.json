Lose control, eat everything until you are stuffed and then grow larger to eat even more.

If nothing else I do feel like I have learned a good bit about using Unity so I can make a proper game later. Almost all the assets are free assets I got from Unity or lazy models created with primitive shapes .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:06:07", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ExtrudedSquared"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
