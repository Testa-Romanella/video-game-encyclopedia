{"id": 101512, "slug": "even-in-arcadia-there-i-am", "name": "Even in Arcadia, There I am", "name_original": "Even in Arcadia, There I am", "description": "<p>\"Even in Arcadia, There I Am\" is a short, experimental game about memory, escape, and whatever else you happen to think it's about. Maybe death? That would be deep, right? There is no win state, and there are no puzzles, but there is one \"link\" to another world (this was submitted to Mystjam, after all). It shouldn't be too difficult to find.</p><p>Anyway, you can move around using the WASD keys, look around with the mouse, interact with objects using the left mouse key, and zoom in with the right mouse key. You can bring up the menu with the Escape key. Pretty standard stuff :).</p><p>\"Even in Arcadia, There I Am\" was written and built by yours truly, Aleks Samoylov. Most of the art and models, except as indicated below, under Additional Credits, were crafted by me as well. If you like this piece, and my other work, consider becoming a patron and supporting the creation of more and better interactive art, for as little as a dollar per project! What a boon and bargain! </p><p>Additional Credits:</p><p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong></p><p>\"Eerie Toll\" by Cosmicembers <br/>\"Suburban Summer Night\" by Rodincoil </p><p><em><strong>Music:</strong></em></p><p>\"The Theatrical Poster for Poltergeist III\" by Chris Zabriskie </p><p><em><strong>Models:</strong></em></p><p>Keyboard &amp; mouse models by Sohlier<br/><br/><em>All of the above assets were used under the </em><em>Creative Commons Attribution License v3.0.</em></p><p><strong>Fonts:</strong></p><p>Enochian by Digital Type Foundry (Freeware, Non-Commercial License)<br/>UglyQua by Manfred Klein (Manfred Klein License v1.0)<br/>WC Mano Negra by WC Fonts (Creative Commons Attribution License - No Derivative Works v3.0)<br/>Antonio by Vernon Adams (SIL Open Font License v1.10)<br/>Belligerent Madness by Font Monkey (Font Monkey License v1.00)<br/>Copystruct by Typografski (Freeware License v1.00)<br/>Enigmatic by Objets Dart (Objets Dart License v1.00)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c08f3689721afc591dfd94d80ab000bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aleks Samoylov"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
