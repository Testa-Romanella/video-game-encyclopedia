I used this opportunity to experiment with 2D/3D hybrid gameplay. I used Clembod's country village and warrior assets for all pixel art and animations. I also used Aleksandrilvanov's stylized castle asset for the 3D environment. And finally, I utilized the tools in the Paper2D plugin for the functionality. I hope to use what I learned in this project for future jams!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T11:36:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ec/6ec218d5e67b89ddc0363f26598d4edd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J.Krafty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
