Adjust options as you want and click on Start Game:<br/>\n<p><em>attention: amount of players is actually amount of spy's, i forgor to change that</em><br/><em>Recommended options:<br/>1 spy: 1/1/4<br/>2-3 spy's: 2-3/2/6<br/>4 spy's: 4/2/7</em></p>\r\n2. Press CTRL to show seed/room-codes:\r\n<p>Each room has its <strong>number</strong>, that <strong>changes every game</strong><br/>Ask your friends to take a shot/screenshot of it, if they playing as spys. <strong>Make sure to not look at codes if you a playing as sniper:<br/><br/></strong></p>\r\n\r\n3. Ask them to choose starting room.\u00a0\r\n<p>Starting with first spy, he\u00a0needs to say<strong>\u00a0number of the room he wants to start in. Click on the\u00a0corresponding chip at the bottom:</strong></p>\n\n<p>After that PLAYER 0 at the left corner will change to PLAYER 1. It means <strong>starting position has been saved, and now its time to choose starting position for the next spy.</strong></p>\n<p>When everyone is ready, <strong>press space - its time for a real game...</strong></p>\r\n4. Real game\r\n<p>Spys take turns in the same order when you was choosing starting position.<br/><strong>In each turn they say number of room they want to move in.</strong><br/>Similarly to starting position<strong>, click on the chip below to confirm that.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>To end turn, <strong>press space or wait until timer on top reaches 0<br/>When every spy take their turn, everyone (including bots) moves, and everything repeats:<br/><br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>spy in example above is blue</em></p>\n<p>We see that <strong>spy actually touched some diamond !\u00a0When everyone moves again, gem will be automatically collected, and a new diamond\u00a0\u00a0will be spawned:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>After some time <strong>sniper detects this sussy activity. He presses S to pull up his gun and shoots reckless spy with left click:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>do not die if you playing as spy - you will die</em></p>\r\nWell, it looks like spy's having a bad time there, thats why\u00a0I decided to add some spice:\r\n\r\nYeah boi, thats ITEMS. One of them will be\u00a0spawned randomly, and after you collect it, it got automatically used similarly to diamonds .\r\n<ul><li><strong>Badass smoke</strong> covers half of the area and <strong>gives you ability to be unspotted when you do your crazy things for a decent amount of time</strong></li><li><strong>Loud music will add 3 another dudes to area,</strong> so you can better hide among crowd</li><li><strong>Hack disables light\u00a0in the facility for 1 full turn,</strong>\u00a0so you can do anything you want</li><li><strong>Safe spawns 3 diamonds\u00a0 in random rooms,</strong>\u00a0so you can end game earlier</li><li><strong>Costume change changes appearance of ALL dudes in area</strong>, so sniper cant count only on his memory</li></ul>\r\nUsing all of this stuff, we get fast spy-sniper madness.\r\n<p>P.S. don't take this game as a super serious project - it's just a game to laugh with friends if you have nothing to do for the next half hour. Ive done it in less than 3 days, so if there problems with balance or something like that - let me know. I dont know if this game will receive any updates BUT if you really want them - you know what to do. I read absolutely all comments and even write back! (Not that I have a lot of them actually).
