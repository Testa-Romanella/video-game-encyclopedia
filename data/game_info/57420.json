{"id": 57420, "slug": "mega-man-7", "name": "Mega Man 7 (1995)", "name_original": "Mega Man 7 (1995)", "description": "<p>Mega Man 7 is a platform video game by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the seventh game in the original Mega Man series and the first and only title in the main series to be featured on the 16-bit console. The video game was released in Japan on March 24, 1995 and was localized later in the year in North America and Europe. The game is also available for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection, as well as the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as part of Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, with a Nintendo Switch version planned for release in Spring 2018.</p>\n<p>Picking up directly after the events of Mega Man 6, the plot involves the protagonist Mega Man once again attempting to stop the evil Dr. Wily, who uses a new set of Robot Masters to free himself from captivity and begin wreaking havoc on the world. Along with some help from his old friends, Mega Man finds potential allies in the mysterious robot pair Bass and Treble, who are later revealed to be in league with Wily. In terms of gameplay, Mega Man 7 follows that same classic action and platforming introduced in the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles, but updates the graphics and sound of the series for the more powerful SNES.</p>\n<p>According to its creators, Mega Man 7 was only in development for a short time before its release. Keiji Inafune, a noted character designer and illustrator for the franchise, handed off his duties to Hayato Kaji for this installment. Mega Man 7 has received an overall average critical reception. Although many considered it a competent game by itself, a majority of reviewers either called it a simple rehash of previous entries in the Mega Man saga, or considered it inferior to Mega Man X, released on the SNES over a year earlier.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T09:55:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71cfa6b07767116cf1dc95e46c4ea292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.11, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 28, "beaten": 39, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 35, "suggestions_count": 329, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 35, "platforms": ["Wii U", "SNES", "Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Capcom", "Laguna Video Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
