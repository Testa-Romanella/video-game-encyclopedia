{"id": 150796, "slug": "through-the-horizon", "name": "Through The Horizon", "name_original": "Through The Horizon", "description": "<p>Made for the One Map Challenge on the official RPGMaker community forums.</p>\n<p>Recently, within the last 100,000 years (the twinkling of an eye in cosmic time), a hyper-massive star that was host to a civilization, collapsed into a black hole, dragging everything in its solar system, including the civilization, with it. Now 100 millennia later, strange ominous readings begin emanating from the black hole. Something is stirring within. Something impossible, in a place where nothing should be able to live or escape. You play as Omega Cubed, a grey alien specifically bread and genetically engineered to be a part of the Cosmic Threat Assessment Unit, a breed of greys who's sole purpose is to address cosmic threats and anomalies. Your objective as Omega Cubed is to go \"Through the Horizon\" of Black Hole 3-17 and expunge whatever lies within before it can find a way to emerge and threaten a local inhabited star cluster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe3a182232b99028e1f50358098ae77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["citizen_pips"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
