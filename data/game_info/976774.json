In the spirit of that, each ATARI PRESENTS title is presented unchanged from its original version other than providing the means to play them on modern hardware. Even the store description below is the very same language used to describe the title at the time of its release. Please enjoy!<br/><br/>You're the only human in a huge, robotic space ship, flying at incredible speeds through deep space. Your mission: find and settle a new planet where humanity can thrive. Combat is inevitable, but you'll need more than flying skills to succeed.
