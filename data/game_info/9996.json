This means you can use actual weather predictions from your favorite weather service to plan your journey.Real WavesSailaway simulates the waves accurately, taking the history of wind direction and wind speed into account, as well as current, water depth and nearby islands or shallow areas. The North Sea has different waves than the Atlantic Ocean or South Pacific and each present their own set of challenges.Real Water The colour of the water you sail upon is effected by a great many things, from the blue of pure water to the brownish colour of muddy rivers. Sailaway adjusts water colour by depth and other influences before it renders a single drop of water to make it as realistic as possible.Real Sky Our ancestors navigated by the stars which is why we made sure the positions of the sun, moon, planets and stars are all correct. There is even a handy feature that highlights the constellations but just like in the real world if the sky happens to be cloudy there will be nothing to see but darkness.Real MapsTo aid navigation there is an interactive map that can zoom from world scale to small coves, displaying deep and shallow areas, rocks, buoys, lights and everything you need for a safe journey.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/1858ac2bf44a0f5f0e617941ce68eea7.jpg", "website": "http://www.sailawaysimulator.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 16, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 344, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Orbcreation"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Irregular"], "esrb_rating": null}
