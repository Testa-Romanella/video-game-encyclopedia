Marbles is a simple yet extremely addicting game for family and friends. It\u2019s a fun way to switch it up and kill time while training your brain and logical skills. <br/><br/>How to play: <br/><br/>Marbles starts with 3 colored marbles randomly placed on a 9x9 grid. Place any marble on any empty tile by first clicking the marble you\u2019d like to move and then click on the tile you\u2019d like to move it to. After each move, 3 new marbles are added to the grid.Below the field you can see which 3 marbles of what color will be added to the field after you have made your move.<br/> Move the marbles around to create vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lines of 5+ marbles of the same color. These lines are removed from the board, making space for new marbles. Marbles can only move on empty tiles, make sure the marble you want to move is not blocked by other marbles. The game goes on until the entire grid is filled with marbles and you don\u2019t have any empty tiles to make a move. The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible before the board is filled.<br/><br/>Please leave us a review telling us if you enjoyed Marbles!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:28:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f0/4f0a71e834350733a65ee8fe43c72ef2.jpg", "website": "http://greyheadstudio.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Veronika Medvedeva"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Veronika Medvedeva"], "esrb_rating": null}
