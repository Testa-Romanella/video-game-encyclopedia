If i had more time, I would have fixed the numerous errors.<br/></p>\n<p>I recommend playing in fullscreen so you can see the score counter and also view the beautiful art.</p>\n<p>The controls are as follows: WASD to move, Enter to reset game.<br/></p>\n<p>Your goal is to push all the junk as far to the right as possible. The junk is pushed like in sokoban. Every 6 seconds, a new piece spawns.<br/></p>\n<p>Once you've filled up the whole column to the right with junk, it is supposed to be cleared away and you get points.</p>\n<p>When there are more than 13 pieces of junk on screen at the same time, it's game over. <br/></p>\n<p>If a red piece of junk spawns in between two squares, you can't push it to the left or right. I recommend resetting the game if this happens too many times.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:40:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/553/553d2b8615fafb353aa3c26a67fd615d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaxPowah"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
