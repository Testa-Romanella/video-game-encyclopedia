The raccoon in his cart can pick up foodstuffs like apples, bananas and cereal boxes but not objects like paper cups. He can dash through the aisles, breaking them to pieces with enough momentum. The objective of the game is to pick up as many objects as you can in a minute.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f09/f09db9293968bfb8cd1f3c742e8de862.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rohanmore"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
