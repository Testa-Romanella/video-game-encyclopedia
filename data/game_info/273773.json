After a Brief discussion we arrived at our basic Idea: The player must fight his way through a dungeon in order to destroy the boss creatures within. however in order to defeat the boss creatures the player must sacrifice a part of his vitality (or in other words, his max health) in order to seal away the bosses powers so that he can kill them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However due to unforeseen circumstances we were unable to implement every aspect of the game. Including the main sealing aspect of the boss fight. however the main basic features of our game were implemented and a playable demo of our game is available. We encountered major issues with certain aspects of the games development as we were not used to using the Unity engine. however, we do feel that the game we have produced is somewhat fun to play, if somewhat short. and we feel like we have learned a lot from this experience and can improve upon this game and any other games we produce in the future because of this experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fd/0fdc0d1d2ff0fb1bd56c80a510072a2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cronatus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
