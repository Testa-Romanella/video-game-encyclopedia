Finally I decided that if I ever wanted to get better I needed to follow through for once and take a game from an idea to a completed entity. <br/><br/>But to do this I needed to start small, so I decided to take a page out of the game jam playbook: I picked a theme (found one using\u00a0this\u00a0generator) and set a hard deadline of two weeks, by which point I would release the game. Now that time has come and I present to you Epidemic. It's not going to blow any minds, win any awards or climb to the top of the charts, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless!
