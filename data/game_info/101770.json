{"id": 101770, "slug": "roguebox-adventures", "name": "RogueBox Adventures", "name_original": "RogueBox Adventures", "description": "<p><strong>December 30th 2017 Version 2.2.1(Hotfix) released!</strong></p>\n\n<p> RogueBox Adventures is a graphical roguelike with strong influences from sandbox games like Minecraft or Terraria.<br/> </p>\n<p>The main idea of RogueBox Adventures is to offer the player some kind of roguelike toy-world. This world can be explored at free will and even be changed.</p>\n<p>It is possible to chop down trees, gather plants or to dig trough the underground rock. The resources that are obtained on this way can be used to build structures (like buildings or whole settlements) or to craft new items like tools, weapons or furniture. Big structures allow peaceful villager NPCs to spawn inside them. Outdoor monsters like angry dryads, orcs and slimes wait for their chance to kill or to be taken by the player.<br/></p>\n<p> To allow a easy access to the game for everyone RogueBox Adventures offers different game modes, may it be a sandbox-mode, where all monsters are peaceful, or a real roguelike-mode, where dying means to loose every progress made inside a game world. Furthermore RogueBox Adventures tries to use as less key bindings as possible, what allows to play it even with a gamepad if you like. <br/></p>\n<p>Homepage</p>\n<p>Git-Repo<br/></p>\n<p>Dev-Group<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dd/7dd3a272df240f3c5ca412276ad236e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["themightyglider"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
