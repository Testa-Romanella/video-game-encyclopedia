The games featured three songs from the respective musical groups, and the player edited pre-made clips to make a new music video. The games were universally panned and were financial disasters.</p>\n<p>In each game players are given instructions of what they should include in the video, and then the song is played while the video is edited live. Players can change between video clips available by pressing the buttons on the controller, and choose from clips of videos of the group, stock footage, movie clips, and special effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d8/3d83f3dfb2907e515984594f98c2661b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA CD"], "developers": ["Digital Pictures"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
