I'm 21yo student and i have created this game to better understand unity. Basically you play as Slimy spit that wants to reach the cinema. You are spitted out and flying through the city while you try to collect germs and avoid flies and asteroids. After hitting the ground the shop opens up where you can upgrade your spit to jump or fly further. Later i want to add endless mode and release it on google play. Please leave a feedback and a rating after playing :)</p>\n<p>Controls: Click and drag to launch, if jump has been unlocked click to jump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Press escape to close the game.</p>\n\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://www.bensound.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T09:46:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a8/4a8eea57f6fa6b71e10d44a27e2ada20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Toby468"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
