The intent of this game is not to be funny, regardless of the art style and audio. Its intent is to show the tension of confrontations such as these, and to give a sense of loss of control in regards to the situation.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to get the officer close to the civilian and to talk him down from killing himself. As you get closer he gets more \"Anxious\" and is more likely to pull the trigger.
