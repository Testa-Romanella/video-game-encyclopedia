Red ships can travel through white areas and white ships can travel through red areas. If a ship travels through an area of its colour, it will die, and the player will lose. However, if a red ship shoots a red area, it will turn white so it can travel on it, and likewise for white. Both ships have to try make the other touch an area of its colour in order to win. This may all seem pretty complicated, but the gameplay is actually very simple and competitive. It's meant for two players, so be sure to grab a friend! Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dd/8dd8ec4f6a199fb95910e58ad7a40d86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jotlane"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
