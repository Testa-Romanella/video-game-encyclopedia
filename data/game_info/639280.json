Average Playtime is 4-7 hours. The Road of Light itself is an experiment that has some drastically divergent gameplay when compared to many other M\u00f6rk Borg scenarios. The Road of Light focuses not on combat but instead on puzzle solving. Often this scenario has no combat at all. The Road of Light instead presents itself as a tool to bond a small party together, via new lore, class changing, and puzzles that force players to work together. It also feeds into a larger epic spanning multiple\u00a0M\u00f6rk Borg compatible ttrpg books that are currently in the works by newyear Studios.</em></em></p>\n\n<p> \"The path before you hums with energy as the ground under your feet slowly begins to glow with white light. The withered grass and charcoal black dirt disintegrate and float away into a pitch-black moonless sky. An illuminated road burst out in front of you clearing a path into the distance. The world shifts as the hills and valleys flatten, conforming to the will of this \u201dRoad of Light.\u201d PCs have been chosen by an unknown god of light to be tested and led to its god throne. Gates create barriers preventing progression until some lesson has been learned or some twisted will is appeased.\"<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Within this document you will find the following:</strong></p>\n<p>- 43 pages filled with strange heavy metal inspired adventuring<br/></p>\n<p>- 14 original illustrations</p>\n<p>- 2 new character classes</p>\n<p>- 11 unique and challenging riddle/clue based puzzles for your players</p>\n<p>- Rich lore that expands the <em><em> M\u00f6rk Borg</em></em> universe into the celestial realm</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>If the names of the Puzzles in this book seem strange or even familiar that's for a reason.
