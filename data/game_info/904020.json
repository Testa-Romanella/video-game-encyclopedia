{"id": 904020, "slug": "coding-at-camp", "name": "Coding at Camp", "name_original": "Coding at Camp", "description": "<p><em>'Coding at Camp'</em>\u00a0is the story of a teenage boy that's gone camping with his family, but forgot to do his coding assignment and it's due tomorrow. You play as him as he tries to avoid getting distracted by his surroundings, pressing the correct key(s) at the correct time.</p>\n<p>The original idea for this game was to make Twister for your keyboard, where, like Twister, the game would be tying your fingers\u00a0up in knots as you try to reach each of the keys that you need to. This game was made over 1.5 months between February - March, 2021 as part of my MA in Games Design.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Q+F+P : reconnect laptop charger</li><li>U : use umbrella</li><li>M : shoo away deer</li><li>H : put on / take off headphones<br/> </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T15:27:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b48/b48a7f2c77138e112d5c0c2a4fe0424f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["CommanderShizzle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
