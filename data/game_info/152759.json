They are only vulnerable to the player of the similar color. On top of that the Mothership and both the arc reactors never have the same color at any given point of time. </p><p>The players have infinite lives but they can only be re-spawned by another player. These situations force the players to talk and cooperate with each other and they must coordinate their attacks in order to defeat the Mothership.</p><p>X-Spark was built using Unreal Engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c94/c9426aa8fff34a319224f2daa40211ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bruno Samuel Leal Rocha"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
