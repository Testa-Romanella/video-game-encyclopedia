They soon became bored themselves so they created a world with all kinds of races to keep themselves entertained. Filled with jealousy, but fearing rebellion, Raist manipulated the races into a false religion to fight against the demi gods. Raist then suggested the demi gods give their children magic as a reward for their loyalty and to combat this new false religion that was threatening the will of the gods. When the demi gods realized that the Raist was the one behind the false religion, they took all the magic from their childen and used it to destroy The Great Creator. Raist was destroyed and the embers of what was left smashed down upon the planet, shattering it into an untold number of pieces and destroyed most of the life on the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter thousands of years the few survivors remaining gained in strength and number. Magic, it was discovered, still remained, but could only be used if embedded into objects such as weapons and armor. The children of the gods used these embedded magical items to rage war against one another. In order to restore peace the races agreed to use arenas as a form of mediation. It was discovered through ancient artifacts and lore that if the ashes of creation were to be merged again it would bring back the creator to answer for his misdeeds and allow magic to be used inherently by the children once again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome of these ancient artifacts were bones of the old races, still emanating with the original magic that they hold. You have been brought back to life through the use of these old bones. Still not able to inherently use the magic within yourself you must decide to simply live your new life with no memory of what you once were or to search out and discover the roots of your past. Will you help bring the ashes of creation together, regain your memories and former glory or do you fear the past and prevent a new Apocalypse when they try to bring The Great Creator back to life?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n- Play as any race in the game..
