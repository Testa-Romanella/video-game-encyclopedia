{"id": 132947, "slug": "escape-velocity-otterworks", "name": "Escape Velocity (OtterWorks)", "name_original": "Escape Velocity (OtterWorks)", "description": "<p>Escape Velocity is the first game of OtterWorks, which is based on the classic shoot-em-up gameplay considering its style. There are no restrictions in the mission-system; we have the freedom to choose on what type of levels we want to prove our skills. We can improve the equipment of our spaceships depending on with what results we completed the chosen mission. The space is a free prey, it is up to us how big our fame is that we acquire.</p><p>Our aim is to broaden the classic shoot-em-up style with the feeling of freedom and to offer continuous challenge for players. Therefore, the gameplay of Escape Velocity is completely based on procedurally generated elements, so the player has to be prepared for the unexpected events each time. The types of missions are set, but the events going on at the levels can never be the same.</p> <br/> <p>The special structure of the weapon system, in which the elements are built on each other, also promises a unique game style. The weapons work with a given type of energy, which can be filled with the credits we have to get in the game in hangars, or they can be collected after the enemies we have shot during the game. However, the tactic we choose really matters. It depends on the chosen weapon to which weapon the shot enemy leaves cartridge.</p><p>The development of Escape Velocity has not been finished yet. New game modes are coming with minigame and multiplayer options. We are expanding the number of venues, so we will be able to complete our missions in diverse environments. We can expect a great wave of new enemies in the next update of Escape Velocity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4f/f4f9aefa525617cd31e0c167b094c091.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OtterWorks"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
