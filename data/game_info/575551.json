Make sure to read and follow the \"Solar System Assignment\" instructions carefully. Then submit the URL below and conduct peer reviews of your fellow learners.<br/></p>\n<p>What I\u00a0added:</p>\n<p>- All planets along with their materials and shaders.</p>\n<p>- Camera effects, both bloom and depth of field applied.</p>\n<p>- Additional work put into the minimap, I\u00a0make a simple little UI, and instead of rendering the camera for a viewport within the screen, I\u00a0render the camera to a texture target which is displayed in the UI.</p>\n<p>- Added a speed slider for the planet rotation, this allows you to speed up, low down, and even reverse the rotation on the planets. Very useful when trying to click on a planet to target the camera.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- I\u00a0made a number of enhancements to the minimap, I\u00a0added a label for each planet so it's more clear what's going on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- I\u00a0implemented a few scripts for all the above work.</p>\n<p>You can see how I usually track works on projects using Trello. I've added details to the cards on where I found resources while learning. For example, tutorials on particle systems, creating minimaps, doing Unity UI, etc.\u00a0here:\u00a0https://trello.com/b/IpTxRwSe/game-design-and-development-1-solar-system</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have also open-sourced this little project in case other students are curious how I did some of the effects etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>source-code:\u00a0https://github.com/bslayerw/coursera-solar-system</p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n<p>itch.io downloads:\u00a0https://bslayerw.itch.io/solar-system</p>\n<p>source code: https://github.com/bslayerw/coursera-solar-system</p>\n<p>Project management:\u00a0\u00a0https://trello.com/b/IpTxRwSe/game-design-and-development-1-solar-system<br/></p>\n<p>Demo video:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T06:16:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3edd46a1b0e599f30b6081245c6877c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Itchy B"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
