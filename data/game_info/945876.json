You are the sword and you have to get to the top of three castle levels for no particular reason.\u00a0\u00a0The difficulty increases the further through the levels you get. It has obstacles such as spikes and an item which slows down the speed of the player to throw them off. I have made this alone and it has taken about 4 months. Its my first game so plz be nice. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T11:59:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef02dc41782a6403936cca5087800349.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PortalGazing"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
