You play as a starting musician, whose objective is to form a band by recruiting an eccentric display of folks around the village. With new dazzling visuals to gawk at, you and your gang will be able to jam with an array of 12 musical instruments- each with their very own playstyle! This may include you turning your Neo Geo Pocket to match the instrument&#39;s specified orientation, &quot;plucking&quot; strings with the joysticks, and many more unique mechanisms.
