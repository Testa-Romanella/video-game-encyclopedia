{"id": 623767, "slug": "ue4-racing-prototype", "name": "UE4 Racing Prototype", "name_original": "UE4 Racing Prototype", "description": "<p>This prototype features a checkpoint system that has a tracker attached to each checkpoint. The player will make their way through the racetrack, clearing checkpoints, until they hit the final checkpoint. If the laps is set to more than one, the checkpoints will restart, if not then the race will end. At the end of each lap and race the game will check the time it took. If the time is better than the default best time for either the lap or race, the game will then create a new save slot for those times. When the game is closed and restarted, the game will then load the saved time rather than using the default time.</p>\n<p>I chose to create this as I wanted go gain more knowledge and experience in making core mechanics for the racing genre, as it is something I have always had a great interest in and wanted to expand my skill set into. I was able to learn about a new system in a genre I had not previously touched before, it has helped me to become a lot more versatile as a designer and show my interest in other manner of types of games and their mechanics.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:12:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99d/99d9039e7caca996d2bbc653fba83de4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam Davies"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
