It\u2019s the same high energy, competitive local multiplayer brawler with fast paced sword combat and jetpacks you love, but with tons more features!<h3>New Gamemodes</h3>In addition to the original tactical sword-and-shuriken gameplay of Classic Deathmatch, two new gamemodes are available!<br/>Experience a whole new way to play in Neo Deathmatch, with crazy game-changing modifiers that ensure no two rounds are the same. Gain a crown if you are skilled enough to get a win streak, but be sure not to lose it! Neo Deathmatch is sure to keep everyone on their toes until the very end.<br/>Play keepaway in Oddball, where players fight to keep control of a nuclear core until they run out the timer. Respawn as many times as it takes, grab ahold of the oddball, and evade everyone until you take home the win!<h3>Character Customization</h3>Fully customize your robot\u2019s armor and colors exactly the way you like it, with nearly 200,000 possible combinations available! Yellow is still the best, though.<h3>Level Editor</h3>Build your own levels with the fully integrated level editor! Lay it out, instantly test it, make some changes, and when you\u2019re done, save it. Custom levels can be played at any time from the level editor.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T03:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e22/e22521a553d7538d1849a7ec41a0fa4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Handshake Firm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["DigiPen Institute of Technology"], "esrb_rating": null}
