I hope it makes you relive the frustrations of the old classics, where you died every 30 seconds, but each game came a little further.</p>\n<p>This is my first experience of pixel art and level design, so be patient!</p>\n<p>The game plays on browser and is also designed for touch screens.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Function keys + space bar</p>\n<p>Touch buttons on the screen</p>\n\n<p>Rules:</p>\n<p>Avoid the enemies, collect the keys.</p>\n<p>Each key gives +5 energy.</p>\n<p>Each contact with enemies - 10 energy.</p>\n<p>If the energy reaches zero...
