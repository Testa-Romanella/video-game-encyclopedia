The players have to race from the top of the map to the flag at the bottom. The first player to reach the flag 5 times wins. The catch is that every round, player one chooses the controls for player two and vice versa. In addition there are some events that are thrown in to make each round more special.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65d89147c6cc838fe7bc3f4b9be89580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Connor Redwine"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
