Meanwhile, the brushers are attempting to hold a conversation. This can be difficult when your mouth is full of toothpaste foam. Depending on your brushing and spitting, the conversation will be relatively garbled.</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a co op game, though due to the simplicity of the controls its perfectly possible to play alone too. The left brusher is controlled by the A, S, and D keys: A and D to brush, and S to spit. Likewise, the right brusher uses arrow keys left, down, and right: left and right to brush, and down to spit.</p><p><strong>Updates???</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Future updates my include: more levels of garbled-ness; additional conversation branches; hygiene scores; or something entirely different!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T05:58:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c5/4c580565ce193fcbd0bf294da078024a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Meirian"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
