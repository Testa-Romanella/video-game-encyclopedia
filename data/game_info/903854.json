I saw this excellent asset pack from NotJam, and had to make something with it. Their game to demonstrate the assets is a lot of fun, and uses a gameboy aesthetic...so I figured why not try and put this on an actual GameBoy?<br/><br/>This game was built in a week.<br/></p>\n<p>This should run on GameBoy and GameBoy Pocket, but will run better on a Gameboy Color. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T14:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa6/aa6f510799cb483d0b3d28d0937819b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lazy Dev Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
