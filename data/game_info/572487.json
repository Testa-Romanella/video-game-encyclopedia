This project is for educational purposes only.</p>\r\nThis is just an ugly and buggy prototype! My only goal with this project is to share with you what I've been learning about Unity and\u00a0game development.\r\n<p><strong>MAKING OF:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY ONLINE:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To play it online with a friend, you have 3 options:\r\n</p>\n<p>- First option is to set up a \"port forwarding\" in your modem (this might be complicated).\r\n</p>\n<p>- Second option: you and your friends can install a private VPN software such as Hamachi:\u00a0www.vpn.net\r\n</p>\n<p>- The third option is to use Steam. You can add the executable of this game (Goku Theft Auto.exe) as a \"non-Steam game\" to your library and run it from Steam. Ask your friend to do the same. At the game's main menu, click on \"Host on Steam\". Then ask your friend to also launch the game and\u00a0join you by clicking on your name on his Steam friends list.\r\n</p>\n<p>Note this is not an official Steam game. The Steam option is only for testing and development.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T06:21:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/870/8701770c592f5f82563f8f7aeb8fd717.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["O Programador"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
