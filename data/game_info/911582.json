Now, for it's tenth anniversary, the game has been rebuilt from the ground up, sporting a fresh coat of paint and a handful of QOL improvements! <br/><br/>Light the Way brings a twist to the classic memory game genre! A sequence of tiles will light up across the playing grid. It is your job to memorize which tiles light up and the order that they light up in, then recreate said sequence. Sounds easy, but as you reach higher difficulties, the playing grid becomes larger and the sequences longer, testing how effective your memory truly is!<br/><br/>[KEY FEATURES]<br/>-60 memory straining levels<br/>-3 challenging difficulty levels<br/>-Beautiful, simplistic design that keeps players in the game without distractions<br/>-No timers! Play when you want for however long you want!<br/>-Buy once with no restrictions in current and future content!<br/><br/>REVIEWS FOR THE ORIGINAL LIGHT THE WAY<br/>**** This is a very fun game, and can be quite mind taxing.
