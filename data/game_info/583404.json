Between the demands of the trip, the severe jet lag, and taking one too many \"Xtra Strength\" flight sedatives you're barely standing. Bag after bag pass you by but none belong to you. The airport is nearly silent, as it is almost empty, you're all alone, late in the night, with only unclaimed luggage to keep you company.<br/></p>\n<p>It's almost hypnotic watching the luggage pass in front of you along the conveyor belt, like counting sheep. Gym bag... suitcase... briefcase... backpack... gym bag... backpack...... suitcase... is that a bottle of kombucha?</p>\n<p>You let out a long yawn as you feel your eyelids grow heavy, and you lose your balance, falling facefirst onto the conveyor belt. You embrace the sweet darkness of sleep as you succumb to your exhaustion.</p>\n<p>You wake up from your impromptu nap to the sound of rumbling machinery, and the scraping of luggage sliding down metal chutes. You jerk yourself awake, looking all around you, and find yourself somewhere unlike you've ever been before.</p>\n<p>You've found yourself inside the conveyer belt system of the airport. A giant warehouse, dark, cold and uncaring. The conveyor belt you fell unconscious on, pushing you endlessly to an unknown destination. You've always wondered where these conveyor belts lead to, but this isn't how you wanted to find out.</p>\n<p>You get to your feet and see a human skull at your feet before you. Terrified, you lock eyes with its empty eyesockets, and you feel a chill run up your spine, a ghostly presence all around you.</p>\n<p>You dare not suffer the same fate as the unfortunate souls that came here before you.</p>\n<p>For the sake of your life, it is time for you to escape: the Luggage Labyrinth.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Movement: [W, A, S, D]</p>\n<p>Rotate Character: [Q, E]</p>\n<p>Combat Controls:</p>\n<p>Attack: [W]</p>\n<p>Dodge: [S]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T22:53:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f96b07619c9dee38baa571535c7e60d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tfx", "zoped", "SonderGaming", "Xuubasa"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
