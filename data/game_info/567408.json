{"id": 567408, "slug": "altercation", "name": "Altercation", "name_original": "Altercation", "description": "<p>Steer tanks through a variety of arenas and destroy your opponents! These tanks have some cutting edge features: damage increases firepower, and destruction does not necessarily mean defeat.\u00a0Fight through 9 levels of a single player campaign, or challenge a friend.</p>\n<p>Altercation is a new NES game written for the 2020 NESDev Homebrew Competition. Gameplay resembles a\u00a0mash-up of Combat and Asteroids. When your tank is hit, it will split into two smaller tanks, and both will drive and fire with the same controls. You can also merge back into a larger tank to regain one hit point.</p>\n<p>Campaign gameplay is pretty simple, a series of 9 levels with various combinations of player and NPC tanks, and challenging levels. If there's interest, I may revisit the project and add more NPC types, and more varying levels and obstacles.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T09:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/369/3690e3ec78a70699bab3ece80e9feff2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Doc"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
