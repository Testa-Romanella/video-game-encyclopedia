Play against other players in local hot seat mode or online.</p>\n<p>The game is in a very early stage, but functional enough so people can try it out and give me feedback on how they feel about it. The idea is, that you can participate in playtesting for free and guide the development. Since it is a multiplayer focused game, it is hard to balance the game without player feedback.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone in advance for giving it a try!<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Gameplay:<ul><li>On your turn, you select cards from a hand of 7 cards.</li><li>Each card has a certain amount and kind of actions associated with it.</li><li>Arrage cards to your pawn plan, so that you have at least 5 actions ready.</li><li>After all players planed their turn, the actions are resolved simultanously.</li><li>If your pawn looses all it's hit points, you loose!</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Online Play:<ul><li>The game connects to a lobby where you can host or join games.</li><li>NOTE: If you play agains other players online, you directly connect to them, which means both see the internet IP of each other.</li><li>NOTE: The server might not always be online.
