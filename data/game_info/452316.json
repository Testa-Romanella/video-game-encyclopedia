Use the arrow keys to steer, and the space key to thrust. Try to land on the blue pad at the end of the level. Green pads with a symbol above them are safe (good for timing obstacles). Can you be the skilled pilot to fly Billy through the levels? (Expect bugs, the game is in Beta.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:53:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/91476dbda98060a9ec0f34cf7d7aa64d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dreaminggravel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
