{"id": 954400, "slug": "arken-demo", "name": "Arken (Demo)", "name_original": "Arken (Demo)", "description": "Welcome to the world of Arken\r\n<p>\u00a0<strong>[Release of full version is postponed!]</strong></p>\n<p>In this retro inspired Zelda-like you take the role of the hero to save not only one but two worlds.\r\n</p>\n<p>'The day has come for you to take the Guard's Trial, young knight!', the king of Liones Castle spoke to me.\u00a0Back then, I didn't know it was the day my quest to save Arken started. So I left the castle and went South to the Cave of Trials.'</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nNote of the developer\r\n<p>After a longer hiatus, working on and releasing other projects, I thought it was time to finally finish this game. It\u00a0is a project of my heart and so I began to completely remake the engine and graphics from scratch 3 months ago. Fortunately I\u00a0found\u00a0<strong>RyanAvx</strong>, a Twitch streamer and music maker, who is now in charge of doing all the music and sound effects. And he has already done a\u00a0really great job! Thank you, Ryan!\r\n</p>\n<p>Also, I decided to make the original game idea of a procedurally generated game, an option. In the full version you will not only be able to play the randomly generated world version that you know of previous versions, there will also be an\u00a0<strong>Item randomizer</strong>\u00a0mode. Inspired by popular randomizers of today (Zelda - A Link to the past etc...) there will be a bunch of options for the randomization logic, like keysanity, enemizer and so on.\r\n</p>\r\nWhat this Demo contains\r\n<p>Story mode with the first 3 full dungeons of the game and around 40 % of the first overworld.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can already find lots of optional items, talk to people and explore the world.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Supported languages:\r\n</p>\n<p>- English\r\n</p>\n<p>- German\r\n</p>\r\nWhich input methods are supported?\r\n<p>Currently the game supports keyboard and XBOX-controllers. You are able to configure the keys / gamepad buttons in game. To reconfigure the key mapping, select options in the file select screen and navigate to the input device you want to configurate.\r\n</p>\n<p>This table contains the default input settings:\r\n</p>\r\nButton\r\nKeyboard\r\nGamepad (Xbox)\r\nActions performed\r\n\r\nArrow-Up\r\nDPad-Up\r\nMove player, navigate menus\r\n\r\nArrow-Down\r\nDPad-Down\r\nMove player, navigate menus\r\n\r\nArrow-Right\r\nDPad-Right\r\nMove player, navigate menus\r\n\r\nArrow-Left\r\nDPad-Left\r\nMove player, navigate menus\r\n\r\nA\r\nButton 1 (A)\r\nPlayer talk, lift, roll etc, confirm in menus\r\n\r\nS\r\nButton 2 (B)\r\nUse Sword, cancel in some menus\r\n\r\nF\r\nButton 3 (X)\r\nOpen map, close map\r\n\r\nD\r\nButton 4 (Y)\r\nUse equipped item, save in inventory\r\n\r\nE\r\nLeft shoulder\r\nQuick swap items\r\n\r\nR\r\nRight shoulder\r\nQuick swap items\r\n\r\nEnter\r\nStart\r\nOpen inventory, close inventory\r\n\r\nWhat if I find a bug?\r\n<p>It's very likely you will find bugs.
