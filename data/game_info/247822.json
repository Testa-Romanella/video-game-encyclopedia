I've never programmed a combat before, I still suck at platformer level design and I've never programmed a boss battle before. So all of this was developed in a big hurry and with spaghetti code.</p>\n<p>That being said, I hope you enjoy what I was able to put out for this jam and leave any feedback!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm considering on taking ths project eventually and turn into something that is playable for 1 hour, maybe add procedural map generation on each gameplay, dunno, I think thas idea has potential, leave your thoughts on the comment section below.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>The attack's swoosh is from Buch's \"A Platformer in the Forest\" asset on OpenGameArt</p>\n<p>The Hearts in the UI are from ArMM1998's \"Zelda like tileset and sprites\" asset on OpenGameArt</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Snowfinal</p>\n<p>Music: Looped Pizzicato</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/3538e5cfa6a904320f61ec6855f2ac0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gueepo"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
