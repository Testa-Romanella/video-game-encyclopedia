All he's got to do is collect some ores for his boss. That there's a good job 'round these part for a boy o' 12.</p>\n<p>Dig deep, then ride the rope up to cash in your ores and buy upgrades. You're going to need at least 1 pick upgrade to mine the deep ore.\u00a0Dig down again for a new random hole.<br/></p>\n<p>Kind of a sequel to another game I made, Bullet Farm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Version 2: Fixed audio and added a mute button. The sound effects sounded ok on my headphones, but can sound terrible on others. Like needles to the ear bad.\u00a0I listened to it on my brother's headphones and using my laptop speakers and the sound pops a lot. I reduced the volume in unity and that\u00a0might have fixed it, but if not, there's now a mute button.</p>\n<p>Made with Unity, Paint.net, Bfxr</p>\n<p>Code if you want:\u00a0https://github.com/TyLanger/DepthGauge</p>\n<p>Font: https://pixeloverload.itch.io/basicfonts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T12:07:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/756c983ea6d4ffc231f4194433b576ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Solrun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
