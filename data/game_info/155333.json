Eat magic berries, fruits and mushrooms to change size and become invisible.</p><p>Beware of angry birds, deep water, green slime and boiling lava because that stuff will hurt Jumpy!</p><p>The only thing you know for sure is that there is a golden walnut in each level - how to get there, you must find out yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["awesume"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
