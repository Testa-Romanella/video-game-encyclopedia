Eventually I chose the latter and it had it's impact on the game. If I had plan for structure of the code on day one, I'd probably finish 2 or 3 episodes and make them longer.<br/>It has not been tested throughly, the text was not formatted properly, there's probably a ton of bugs - you're going to love it.</strong></p>\n<strong>\n<p>Anyway, it was fun to make. If interest araises, I might redo this and continue in more humanitarian environment, like Twine 2.</p>\n</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T04:36:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aea/aea3c3edb3a16d5b69865afa98a4b12a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shelled Spectre"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
