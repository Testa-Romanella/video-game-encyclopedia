Hover over cards to see details of each.<br/><strong>2. </strong>A round begins. You draw 5 cards the first round. Every successive round, you draw one card.<br/><strong>3. </strong>Click on a card to play/equip it for that round. Card effects only last for that specific round. All card effects are stacked. You can equip upto 8 cards.<br/><strong>4. </strong>Once you've equipped your cards, start that round.<br/><strong>5.</strong> WASD/Arrows to move around + Z/J to shoot the boss. What you shoot depends on what you equipped (if you didn't equip a weapon, you can't shoot).<br/><strong>6.</strong> Round ends if timer runs out or you kill the boss. If you do not have a weapon card equipped, just survive till the end of round.<br/><strong>7.</strong> If you kill that round's boss, you get to choose from the boss' cards + a reward card. Select any one card to add to your hand.<br/><strong>8.</strong> Any card you equipped that round gets shuffled back into the deck.<br/><strong>9.</strong> Next round begins, you draw another card, and continue.</p>\n<p>Created from scratch for Ludum Dare 41 #ldjam #ld41 by Diptoman Mukherjee, Pranjal Bisht and Joel Montpetit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cf/8cf91cb5708403b831bdc75e1facc9ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Diptoman"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
