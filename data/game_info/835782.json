{"id": 835782, "slug": "phasm8", "name": "Phasm8", "name_original": "Phasm8", "description": "<p>This is a 32KB demake of Phasmophobia, a 21-gigabyte horror-puzzle game.</p>\r\nHow to play Phasm8\r\n<p>Just like in Phasmophobia, there are seven different evidences possible (as of writing). You need to find three to determine what kind of ghost it is.</p>\n<ul><li>Press X/V to talk. Talking will temporarily increase the rate of interaction.</li><li>Hold Z/C to open the equipment wheel/navigate menus/etc.</li><li>Ghost abilities are described in the Journal. Use left/right arrows to turn the pages.</li><li>When the Spirit Box is on, talking may\u00a0incite a verbal response from the ghost if you are within range.</li><li>The Writing Book, Video Camera and D.O.T.S.\u00a0Projector can be placed. Observe the \"video feed\" from the outside terminal.</li><li>Use the UV Light to look for fingerprints (n.b.:\u00a0just like in the game, footprints do\u00a0<em>not</em> count, but can be used to help identify Wraiths).</li><li>The EMF reader will track recent interactions, just like in the regular game.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p>(There are currently some debug tools in the Pause menu; these might be removed later.)</p>\r\nHunts\r\n<p>The ghost will hunt. You will know when it happens.\u00a0You will hear louder footsteps as it gets closer to you. Hide!</p>\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>The Journal lets you select and filter out evidences and ghosts, just like in the game.</li><li>Any equipment that is turned on will remain on if you switch to another held item.</li><li>You can view ghost activity levels from the CCTV\u00a0monitor (a reading of 5 may indicate EMF5!).</li><li>Due to the lack of doors, ghosts can leave handprints on most surfaces, but also windows.</li><li>You don't need a Thermometer to look for freezing temperatures. You will see the cold breath when it happens.</li><li>Some ghosts can be identified immediately from their unique traits. Read the journal for information on each one.</li><li>Talking will reduce sanity by 0.5%, so don't overdo it (unless you really want a hunt).</li></ul>\r\nGhosts\r\n<p>23 of the 24 ghosts have been implemented in at least some form. Ghosts have certain abilities carried over from Phasmophobia:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Poltergeist</strong>: may interact with several items all at once.</li><li><strong>Shade</strong>: will interact less if you are in the room.</li><li><strong>Spirit: a</strong>ffected more by Smudge Sticks.</li><li><strong>Goryo</strong>: refuses to present itself on DOTS unless viewed through a camera system.</li><li><strong>Banshee</strong>: will occasionally wander towards you even when not hunting.</li><li><strong>Deogen</strong>:\u00a0always knows where you are, no matter what. Do not hide!</li><li><strong>Raiju:\u00a0</strong>has a greater effect on your flashlight when hunting. Gets a speed boost from placed electronic equipment.</li><li><strong>Myling:\u00a0</strong>has less audible footsteps in a hunt.</li><li><strong>Oni:\u00a0</strong>interacts way more. can launch an object at high speed.</li><li><strong>Yurei</strong>: more likely to perform a mist event, and events will drain more sanity.</li><li><strong>Moroi:\u00a0</strong>will curse the player if the Spirit Box is answered. Sanity Pills will remove the curse.</li><li><strong>Obake:\u00a0</strong>has a chance to leave a unique handprint.</li><li><strong>Revenant:\u00a0</strong>decreased hunt speed, increased chase speed.</li><li><strong>Demon</strong>: hunts too much.</li><li><strong>Yokai</strong>: much easier to annoy by talking, but is not very perceptive.</li><li><strong>The Mimic</strong>: will copy random ghost abilities, and has orbs too.</li><li><strong>Jinn</strong>: will never shut off the breaker.</li><li><strong>Hantu</strong>: will shut off the breaker more. Has frosty breath.</li><li><strong>Onryo</strong>: will try to hunt if a candle is extinguished.</li><li><strong>Wraith:\u00a0</strong>will never leave footprints (visible with the UV Light) after stepping\u00a0in salt.</li><li><strong>Mare:</strong> hates lights, never turning them on and more likely to turn them off.</li><li><strong>The Twins</strong>: increased interaction range to throw you off, and may also perform \"twinteractions.\"</li><li><strong>Thaye</strong>: will start off fast, and will interact frequently, but this will gradually fall off.</li></ul>\n<p>Ghost information is provided in the Journal if you need the information while you play.</p>\n<p>Good luck, hunter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb7/cb738f754b90349fa71954e467b24966.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kemohaus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
