You&#39;re in for the longest night of your life. Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves, bats - creatures lurking around every corner. As you descend deeper and deeper, they get thicker and thicker. Better stick close to the cavern floor - it&#39;s your only chance of finding a weapon or two. You&#39;re gonna need &#39;em. Because when you finally meet the Count, you know he&#39;ll be going for the jugular. So keep your courage up and your stake sharp. And say your prayers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-11T18:07:27", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
