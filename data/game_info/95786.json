Shoot them and they will break into 1-4 shards.<br/>Sometimes there is ore inside, collect it to grow longer. Ore will wrap around the screen twice before vanishing.<br/>The longer your snake, the more bullets you can fire, and you score more points for each move you make.</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong><br/>Moving object leave trails to help you infer direction from static screens.<br/>Plan several moves in advance, your bullets need time to travel<br/>Beware the chain reactions.<br/>You can wrap around the screen edges but the middle of the screen is safer</p>\n<p><em>PLEASE NOTE:<br/>The collision code can occasionally get inaccurate when the screen gets very busy.<br/>I started very late so I didn't have time to fix this. Will rectify post-compo.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01dc9b693c69fa9216ffaca8544be694.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iLKke"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
