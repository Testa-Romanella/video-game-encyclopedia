The resolution is locked to 64x64 pixels, although on start up you have the option to scale the window to a different set size.</p><p>You play the role of a space telescope's onboard computer. Your mission is to try to discover 10 new exoplanets.</p><p>Use the WASD or Arrow Keys to rotate the telescope and left mouse click on a star that you think has an exoplanet orbiting it. Be careful however, if you choose incorrectly 5 times, it will be assumed that the onboard computer is faulty, and the mission will be abandoned.</p><p>Be careful not to point the telescope directly at the sun as it will damage the sensors and could leave the spacecraft rendered useless.</p><p><strong>Post Jam</strong><br/></p><p>I've updated the computer builds so that the star hitboxes are smaller. This should make it so that you're more likely to select the star you're over.</p><p>I've also uploaded an android build. This doesn't meet the 64 x 64 requirements but allows you to play on the move. It's best played with a phone that has a gyroscope. If you don't have a gyro, then I'd advise playing with the phone starting parallel to the ground. Hold down on the screen for 3 seconds to simulate pressing the space bar (to skip the intro / restart the game).</p><p>For those with no idea how to detect exoplanets, here is a hint based on the recent Mercury transit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4c/f4c7fdfcea42d3a6be33cac24604264e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Skully B"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
