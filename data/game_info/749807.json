We aim to show players that it is a clear and present issue that needs to be addressed. <br/></p>\n<p><em>How to play:</em><br/></p>\n<p>The default controls are as follows:\r\n</p>\n<p>W - Move forward\r\n</p>\n<p>A - Move left\r\n</p>\n<p>S - Move back</p>\n<p>D - Move right\r\n</p>\n<p>Left click/E + drag - Move mirror along track\r\n</p>\n<p>Space - Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>Left click/E - Rotate mirror 90 degrees/interact\r\n</p>\n<p>Esc - Open pause menu\r\n</p>\n<p>The primary objective in the game is to reach the pit at the end of the level, which you fall into to progress onward. This helps the player get closer and closer to retrieving the plant, which is the main goal of the character. To do this, you must pass through a series of puzzle rooms where you must rotate mirrors to direct a laser to a receiver. By connecting lasers to all receivers in a room, the next door will unlock. In addition, the player can also find and read tattered notes scattered around the pyramid to learn more about the artifact, as well as the Protegat corporation.\r\n</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, you will encounter many types of mirrors. For instance, some mirrors are blocked (they will have a maroon base), and cannot be rotated. Other mirrors, however, can be rotated by left-clicking them. These mirrors are indicated by orange bases. Other mirrors will be on a track, and they can be dragged on in order to slide them. They will have grey bases. Receivers to the lasers are indicated with a colored glow with two gems. Receivers will remain unlit until a laser is directed into it. Emitters have one gem, but are always lit and directly output the laser. Splitters appear as glass prisms, and will create 2 lasers upon contact with a given laser. Notes will be scattered throughout each level that can be read by walking over them. They contain information about the plot, and help establish context for the player\u2019s objective.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are 5 total levels within the game, and as you complete each level, you can later go back and replay it without needing to play all the ones before it.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Awards:</strong></p>\n<p>2nd Place in Video Game Design at 2021 National TSA Conference<br/></p>\n<p>1st Place in Video Game Design at 2021 Florida TSA Conference</p>\n\n<p>Donations are appreciated, as they help us create more games!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T09:41:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/359/35994dfa5dfda262bc99d552d4279bd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StudioDB"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
