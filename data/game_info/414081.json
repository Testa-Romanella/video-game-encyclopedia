In Escape the Hedge Maze with the Bros you play as a bro that can't attack, but must avoid skeletons and use their smarts with your friends to navigate through the maze.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Standard controls - use WADS for your arrow keys and enter to initiate bro chat.\u00a0Hit 1 turn on/off audio!! Hit 2 to turn on/off music!!</p>\n<p><strong>Gates</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You must navigate the maze, but at some point you will find gates that need to have a bro on a pressure plate in order to get through. Use your bro weight to stand on the plate and let a bro through. Once through you can find another pressure plate that is on the other side that will open the door for your bro.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Skeletons</strong></p>\n<p>Skeletons are not bros and in fact they're anti bro if you can believe it. Skeletons also have no respect for hedges and will go through them at will (not very bro like). Avoid them at all costs or you will be sent back to the start.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Find the Exit!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Find the exit and make sure all bros get to it to exit the maze. NO BROS LEFT BEHIND. Another maze will generate after you get to the exit.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTACT</strong></p>\n<p>This game was created by\u00a0HeapOverfl0w on GitHub and\u00a0Legacy System Software.\u00a0 Please try out my WIP game\u00a0Solivern!\u00a0Please follow me on GitHub and I will follow you back!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:32:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d43c50dae90a120793170d586cd79bab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Legacy System Software"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
