{"id": 136311, "slug": "rumble-dogs", "name": "Rumble Dogs", "name_original": "Rumble Dogs", "description": "<p>\r\n\tFor Cipher Prime's 12-hour 1v1 themed game jam we've created Rumble Dogs, a fast-paced, two-player, arcadey take on the traditional turret game. Players take their turns at the same time as the game switches back and forth between Movement and Firing phases. Use the Movement phase to take position and act quick in the Firing phases to unleash on your enemy before he does the same to you. Be careful not to hit yourself as you take double damage from your own shots! Yow!\r\n</p><p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></p><p>Direct hits hurt more than splash damage. If you get hit during the firing phase before you get a shot off yourself you can no longer aim or adjust power for that phase but you can still shoot while tumbling through the air! And again, be sure not to hit yourself as that double damage really hurts! Have fun!</p><p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p><p>Player 1:<br/></p><ul><li>(move) A,D \u2013 move left/right</li><li>(firing) A,D \u2013 rotate turret counterclockwise/clockwise</li><li>(firing) W,S \u2013 increase/decrease power of shot</li><li>(firing) Space \u2013 shoot</li></ul><p>Player 2:</p><ul><li>(move) \u2190,\u2192 \u2013 move left/right</li><li>(firing) \u2190,\u2192 \u2013 rotate turret counterclockwise/clockwise</li><li>(firing) \u2191,\u2193 \u2013 increase/decrease power of shot</li><li>(firing) Enter/Return \u2013 shoot</li></ul><p>Built in Unity using 2D Toolkit and GoKit<br/>by Chris Hoopes &amp; Dustin Twilley<br/>July, 2013<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3dba8087332a2789eec6f26d65fe1fbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ghost Crab Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
