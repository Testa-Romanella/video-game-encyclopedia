These monsters generates a new energy source, and your job is to collect them through giving out to your subordinates. Through this process, you can open up new departments that facility allows and encounter various monsters. In the game, the player will have to go through the company\u2019s fear and tension filled atmosphere. <br/><br/><br/><strong> \u201cOur new technology will bring salvation to the human race.\u201d </strong><br/><br/>Lobotomy corporation is a newly established energy company that extracts infinite amount of entropy through the isolation of abnormality with our self developed technology. This is only an impression that the public has regarding our company. You will see its reality after you have joined us.<br/><br/>Our facility is formed of many departments just like any other companies.

You will only have your eyes and the manual to guide you. Speculate which process will be most suitable for each Abnormality. After that, just pick and place your employee who is best suited for the job and wait for results. Also, you will have to gather information through giving out orders to your employees to \u2018examine\u2019 the creature. Proceed to the end of the observation to complete the Abnormality\u2019s encyclopedia.<br/><br/>Abnormality\u2019s energy generation level depends on their conditions<br/><br/><br/><strong> This game is NOT a tycoon.</strong><br/><br/>As mentioned before, Abnormality is a creature that should be handled with extreme alert. Some of them might doesn\u2019t like the idea of humans keeping them locked up in chambers.  They will try to escape when they have a chance and when they do, they will destroy everything. Be it our employees or the facility.<br/><br/>Furthermore, certain Abnormality can brainwash and corrupt our employees into their pawn. These \u2018pawns\u2019 can have a bad effect on other employees and might randomly attack the people around them. Also, they also bring down the other employees mentality level which might result in disobedience. You could get rid the them of course, but you should consider the fact that all the information and data regarding that employee will be deleted as well.<br/><br/><br/><strong> One disaster will cause another, and it will lead everything into chaos.</strong><br/><br/>If you do not stop them instantly, the situation will get out of hand and fall int chaos. When this situation does occur, you will have to decide whether you will gather employees to recapture the Abnormality, or destroy some part of the facility with explosives to secure the company\u2019s safety. \u201cDo you have any wishes, administrator?\u201d <br/>Lobotomy corporation is divided into work procedure and the story mode.
