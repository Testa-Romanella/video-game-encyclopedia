With new moves, improved gameplay and more challenging levels. Run over the tables, take long jumps, slide under the chalks, climb walls and dodge the sticks to avoid taking damage. But despite the difficulties you will always have the support of your fans by your side, who will encourage and applaud all your progress. And while you decide what your next move will be, demonstrate your skills (not so much) to your fans.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Checkpoints</li></ul><ul><li>Fluid gameplay</li></ul><ul><li>Challenging levels</li></ul><ul><li>Funny moves</li></ul><ul><li>Breathtaking moments</li></ul><ul><li>Parkour moves</li></ul><ul><li>3rd or 1st person</li></ul><ul><li>Good for speedrun</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T03:24:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b3/7b3ea60c6ad170bc45ed800ec4810bb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One Buck"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["One Buck"], "esrb_rating": null}
