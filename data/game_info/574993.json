Soon after starting to collect resources you notice a call for help, but from who? Or what? It appears the planet is alive, but it won't be for long. At least, not unless you help!</p>\n<p>This hand drawn RTS is created for the Flair Fair Game Jam 2021. We interpreted the theme \"The environment is alive\" as the planet is alive (but for how long?). It's fully controllable by mouse, so it checks the mouse only extra challenge. Otherwise, we just wanted to make a cool game.<br/></p>\n<p>This is probably the most complex thing we've tried to create in the shortest game jam we've participated in.\u00a0We've found one bug: do not build solar panels in the path of a hovercraft, there is\u00a0a  bug in their pathfinding. Workaround: just send them around the  obstacle. One more bug: \u00a0no level 3. :( We have amazing nature style 'tanks', but no time for the logic behind it. But have fun playing!<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Nico and Gertjan form Shoe Fisher Games, we are indie developers from the Netherlands who create a little game called WanderOut in our spare time.\r\n </p>\n<p>If you like this game, let us know by rating it, commenting on it, or by following us on Twitter or Facebook.
