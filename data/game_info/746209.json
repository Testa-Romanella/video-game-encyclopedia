There is indeed a lot of metaverse project out there but most of them are not as well designed as Imaginary Ones. I followed their Twitter and always waiting for the discord invite to be dropped for almost two months. So without further due here is what made me crack on this project. I am soo glad that I discovered Imaginary Ones and finally got lucky to enter their discord server because the community here is soo great! This project helps the community to be creative, learn new skills and knowledge, and also genuinely enjoyed every moment in community engagement. We will be able to gather in metaverse with our avatars, I LOVE to meet new people. We will be able to chill, learn, play and chitchat without any boundaries or social judgments.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upon checking the Website roadmap, and the ART I fell in love again and this will be a strong HODL for me, imagine falling in love twice in a row with the same person. I love Imaginary Ones because of the real-life engagement and how the project is as a whole. The team is very great at communicating. The community is so wholesome. No matter where you are from, how old you are, what you do, you are welcomed. The best part about Imaginary Ones is they are emphasizing people learning new skills and trying to improve their lives. They teach different courses on twitch like coding in python, wine tasting and many more will come. Imaginary ones give us the chance to show our ideas and imagination. Their lessons about photoshop and python programming inspired and helps me to make my first and second games. I did this because it's also my way to share this great project with other people. I'm a newbie in programming in photo editing but I give my best to make these two games. I also made this fan art to share peace and this message \u201cThe greatest personalities that ever existed have been those who united human beings and put them on the road toward cooperation and effectiveness and peace. Those whom the world has held highest have helped to unite and not sever interconnectedness. They have not been the destroyers of differences but the harmonizer of differences.\u201d-John Lovejoy Elliott. I love this idea where we dream, learn, and play together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So far Imaginary Ones is the only project that I found that has committed to revealing a character every day. I love it because they want to be as transparent as possible, so nobody gets a shock on the reveal day. I can say that this will be the most anticipated project. I was sure that the team is solid and the art is different from projects that are released every day. I'm most excited about the overall potential this project has both from a day one standpoint as well as the greater, long-term plan. I think this is a project I want and need to be involved with. Having been here for several weeks, I love the experience of having an engagement with this community every day. I recommend, share and like to promote this wonderful project to other people, and I love to tell them \"Welcome to the future, Welcome to Imaginary Ones\". And to end this message I just want to say THANK YOU so much Imaginary Ones Team.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:49:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e78/e787e3efe45c0cdcc373a487e1e0a8f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Defiarto"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
