You can kill zombies for money to buy or upgrade your torches to keep the darkness at bay. You can also purchase a gun if it zombies are not dropping them. Zombies will drop more money the higher the wave. The game has basic zombies that just follow you; spitters that will walk after you and fire a projectile at you and dashers who will dash towards you if they get close. The game is meant to be difficult so your meant to die often and once you get to wave 5 the game gets a lot more difficult.</p>\n<p><em>Please tell me what you like and dislike about the game so I am able to make it better in the future.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T13:15:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee0/ee0a8f39240a6ccbd2b536355cfbb316.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thunderbow23"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
