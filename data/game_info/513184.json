It would have been a hectic game where you had service impatient customers while angry neighbors try to burn down your web. However, my faulty motherboard decided to stop me and give me headaches. So just appreciate the basic movement :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T02:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa1/aa185e00b2a5f75d9ab3905ef30bf73a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alpear"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
