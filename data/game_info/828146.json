Our main workload is to design and implement a large mathematical system, so that so many parameters in the game can operate reasonably, and it is the first time to feel the value The hell life of planning, and the UI part that makes us underestimate the workload, to be honest, running a simulation class as a little bit of operation game really kills a lot of time on the UI.<br/><br/>One of the shortcomings is the dynamic performance, not only the scene is not vivid enough, but also the button feedback, and a single shot.<br/>At the same time, because both of them have programming backgrounds, they are both planners and artists. In this competition with many art students, they deeply feel their lack of design ability and scene ability. Thinking about the desire to create the next work, I am very happy.
