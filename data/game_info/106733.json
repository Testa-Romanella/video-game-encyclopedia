You will have to be quick to grab them before they escape so you do not waste any time and are able to get back to your kitchen in order to prepare and server your dished to your customers, the orders will appear on the banners in your kitchen showing you the ingredients you need the create the dish. Be fast and efficient in your quest to create the best food in all the kingdom and above all else don't let Chef Ludum down.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 24 hours by a small team of 4 people working from dusk till dawn to produce something for Ludum dare, this is our first submission for Ludum dare and our first game jam working as a team. The theme was a tough one but we made something we are happy with and has an interesting twist to it. The combination of a cooking game with hunter gather type game play was something we were unsure if it would work when we first went into this, however i can say that we worked hard and should all be proud of what we accomplished within the time limit we set ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Thomas Dunn - Programmer</p>\n<p>James Patterson - Artist</p>\n<p>Harrison Stanley - Artist</p>\n<p>Will Robinson - Artist<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/714/71469115a7b6db50ebbf89c80950e5ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tommohawkaction"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
