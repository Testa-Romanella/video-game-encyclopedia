The state is now littered with L'ville Slugg'r baseball bats, that seem to have wonderful cat flinging properties. <br/><br/>Launch yourself out of your cannon, and use your\u00a0rocket boosts\u00a0to launch from\u00a0bat\u00a0to bat\u00a0while you avoid the\u00a0Virus, the dreaded\u00a0Ohio\u00a0Valley\u00a0Allergens,\u00a0and\u00a0of\u00a0course\u00a0those\u00a0infected still walking around\u00a0not\u00a0heeding\u00a0Uncle\u00a0Andy's\u00a0advice. <br/><br/>As you make your GetAway, you'll come across newly valuable commodities like toilet paper, and soap which you can also sell to upgrade your arsenal.
