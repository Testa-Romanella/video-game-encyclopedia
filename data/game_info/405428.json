I didn't really add anything that was a bug intentionally i just left bugs that appeared on their own. For example the player bobbing up and down is a bug. It was supposed to bob only when you jump. The jumping is also a bug. At first i made it so you can jump very high, but at some random point in time it just stopped working so i left it like that.</em></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:35:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce41b6e1bb93795b12878c4789f920bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gurkis"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
