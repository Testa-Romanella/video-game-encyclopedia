{"id": 754071, "slug": "escape-itch-yuminwu", "name": "ESCAPE (itch) (YuminWu)", "name_original": "ESCAPE (itch) (YuminWu)", "description": "<p>\"ESCAP\" is a survival RPG game. The art style and story background of the game are biased towards horror. Therefore, the gameplay design of the game also wants to bring players an exciting gaming experience, even if this is a tabletop game. Each character also has unique skills, when to use them, and how to plan escape routes. These are all factors that affect victory, not all luck factors. This is the attraction of this game, anyone has control over winning. Not all about luck. Another very interesting point of this game is customization, including customizing the house and the location and number of obstacles. The highly liberalized map editing mode will bring different gameplay and possibilities to the game. And the advantage of replacing certain buildings or items with colors is that it's easy to edit. Just paint the appropriate color where you want to place it. I hope the game can bring you an exciting gaming experience. Happy gaming everyone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T14:06:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/317/3176cf82413ae74b022a0b31b89e1db9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YuminWu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
