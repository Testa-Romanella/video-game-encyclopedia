Might work better on other browsers. Also Windows build has apparently some issues too... These export problems might be out of my scope to repair. Let's keep waiting for Godot 4 stable, I guess.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T13:13:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d9577250db5b8bc5301bbdf0f0b7a773.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Woffelson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
