That thing is a lootbox. We hate that they often times provide those that pay cash an unfair advantage, but we also want that loot just the same. Sometimes you can buy subscriptions with in-game currency and that lets us feel like we cheated the system, but did we? So, I present to you a way to simulate that feeling with no cost. Also, it involves lots of tedious clicking. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>## Instructions<br/>Click the lootbox in the center to generate clicks which are your currency. Use that currency to open the lootbox or buy a subscription.\u00a0</p>\n<p>## Credits<br/>All art and code were done by me, Aaranos.<br/>I removed the Audio vote category as I am using royalty free music.<br/>Song: Village Tarantella by Kevin Macleod</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/308/3089dc7c95a811a1284f02db4e1e72df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["aaranos"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
