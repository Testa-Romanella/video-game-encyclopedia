With every level, levels themselves get progressively more complex as each time, something new appears, which also includes new enemies you may encounter. But sometimes, a big mean antivirus may block your way to stop you from going further. With every boss you beat, you get better upgrades that make you even stronger and deadlier.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T04:53:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc6a85d0285235b0a5381b56afba1683.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Bracket Breakers"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bracket Breakers"], "esrb_rating": null}
