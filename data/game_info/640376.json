{"id": 640376, "slug": "shadows-of-forbidden-gods-demo", "name": "Shadows of Forbidden Gods (Demo)", "name_original": "Shadows of Forbidden Gods (Demo)", "description": "<p>Bring about a new ice age, destroy a small continent with a volcano, end the world in plague, swarm the lands with orcs or bring them under your unholy shadow.</p>\n<p>Shadows of Forbidden Gods is a strategy game where you play the role of a Lovecraftian God come to destroy the human world, through a variety of devastating approaches to full human extinction (or worse). Play as both the God and its agents, infiltrating the human kingdoms and turning them against each other, fighting against the heroes who will take up arms to defend their lands.</p>\n<p>In this demo you play as \"She Who Will Feast\" an as-of-yet unborn God-Worm who is fated to consume the entire world. She casts her shadow from her tomb-nest, as she waits to be reborn from her previous life. At her command are five types of agents, specialised for different roles against humans. If you can corrupt them, the heroes themselves can be brought under your control, letting you subvert your enemies' best weapons against you.</p>\n<p>This is a demo for the real game, which is hoped to launch late 2021, and will expand on this demo in all directions, with more agents, more Gods, more magics, more neutral creatures to bring to your side, more wonders to find and events to experience and new ways to end the world.</p>\n\n<p>A demo for the sequel to\u00a0Shadows Behind the Throne 2. This game takes into account the community's feedback and changes the focus of the game towards the parts which the players enjoyed the most. These are expanded, polished and refined to bring what we hope will be the apocalypse simulator we all were waiting for.</p>\n<p>Reducing the focus on politics allows the agents and gods to be developed in greater depth, with these now being expanded into complex RPG-like characters who can level up, recruit minions and carry out your dark plans in a complex fantasy world. The heroes, of course, also share in this complexity, and will specialise as they level up to try to combat the strategies employed by the agents.</p>\n<p>The NPCs are powered by preference-based AIs, which determine which actions they take (rulers taking national actions to respond to crises, heroes choosing which quests to engage in). Manipulate these to make a ruler too cowardly to fight your orcs, or too violent and ambitious to co-operate against a threat.</p>\n\n<p>Art by https://www.artstation.com/meganwong<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T03:46:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/471/47161b493948814f0b7920e15ecce94f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BobbyTwoHands"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
