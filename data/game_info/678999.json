Links to their page and the forum post here:</em><br/>https://solitaryscribbles.itch.io/<br/>https://forum.weightgaming.com/t/free-sample-sandbox/19802<br/><br/>Do you want to watch a bunch of ladies chow down on some free food?<br/>Do you want to watch fatties bully other fatties to steal their snacks?<br/>Do you want to be responsible for a sudden case of ballooning weight gain by being the bringer of said snacks?<br/>Then you might enjoy this cute little game made by me\u00a0and SolitaryScribbles!<br/>Like the name suggests, Free Sample Sandbox is a sandbox game where you toss food to characters. Watch them chow down and chonk up. The bigger they are, the slower they get.<br/>All the characters are randomly generated and will be different in some way every playthrough.<br/>There are even 2 different types of weight gain that they can randomly experience.<br/>Keep an eye out for rude ones. They\u2019ll belly bump into others to steal their food from them!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Use the mouse to click and drag food items from the bottom menu.\r\n</li><li>Click on the restaurant floor to fire a sonar. This will catch the attention of other characters.\r\n</li><li>Click on a character to follow them around.\r\n</li><li>Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. Right click and drag around to move the camera.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>We hope you all enjoy!<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>(also this is my first time exporting a game for Mac and Linux, if you try playing the game on those platforms and it doesn't work please let me know!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T05:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f6/8f606a5aae4aec0d807dbd13adf9eeff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MaxDigital"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
