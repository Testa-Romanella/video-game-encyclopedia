It was also my first foray into the world of game engines, as well as Godot specifically.</p>\n<p>In this 'game', you play the role of a budding photographer with their first camera dropped in the middle of the Yorkshire Dales. Who knows what shots you'll get?</p>\n<p>There isn't a lot to it, as I'm terrible for over-scoping jam games and never finishing, and I thought I would treat this jam completely as a learning experience (I also know nothing about photography).</p>\n<p>I'd love to see people's \"photos\". The <strong>Gallery</strong> option in the menu should open up the folder on your computer where they're saved.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD to move around, Mouse to look around<br/></p>\n<p>Right-Click to get out and put away your camera.</p>\n<p>With the camera out, Scrolling (or <strong>PAGEUP</strong>/<strong>PAGEDOWN</strong>) changes various things. With no modifiers, it zooms in and out. If you're holding <strong>E</strong>, it changes the exposure timer. If you're holding <strong>F</strong>, it changes the f-stop/aperture. If you're holding <strong>SHIFT</strong>, it changes the focus.</p>\n<p><strong>CTRL </strong>to crouch (and lie down). <strong>SPACE </strong>to get back up again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/992a7a2e825ef016ff4b155c18ca5d5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["IMP1"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
