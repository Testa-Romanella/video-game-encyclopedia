The charges of this gun are limited, and they can only teleport to certain surfaces. With such a stray, you have to solve small puzzles to go through all the rooms, but the further you go, the more difficult it will be for you. Speaking of you, or rather about your character, you are a cube, a cube is you. You are one with this 4-square, and you have a lot to go through together. Yes, in general, the whole world consists of 4-corners (the rest of the corners are not welcome, circles are wanted and are prohibited). I will only add that this is part of the game and it is not a full-fledged game (minor bugs are possible), but we plan to develop it further.</p><p>This is an early version of the game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T21:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e7/7e7b1836b380256515e32dcdaa286fce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G_Game"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
