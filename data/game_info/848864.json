The theme was \u201cwarm feelings\u201d.</p>\n<p>It tries to convey a slice of life from a couple and their daughter. One parent is at times\u00a0too involved in the bedtime stories for her, to the point of making them own. The daughter does not lack imagination, either.</p>\n<p>I had to rush to \u201ccomplete\u201d it in time for the jam, with just 10 days, so it is a\u00a0<em>bit\u00a0</em>rough around the edges\u2014mind your fingers!</p>\n<p>I am very sorry for the low quality of the art and the writing. This is definitively\u00a0<em>not</em> due to the short deadline, unfortunately.</p>\n<p><em>Sigh</em>.</p>\r\n\r\nMusic\r\n<p>\u201cEvil Plan\u201d by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\u201cSCP-x6x (Hopes)\u201d by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\u201cLoopster\u201d by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\u201cLoop Pirates Ahoy\u201d by Morten Barfod S\u00f8egaard (Little Robot Sound Factory)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T00:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/648/6487ccf65792e183857ff22f482133e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PerIta Soft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
