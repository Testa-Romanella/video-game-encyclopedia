{"id": 969806, "slug": "loopworlds", "name": "LoopWorlds", "name_original": "LoopWorlds", "description": "LoopWorlds is a game of difficult logic puzzles, with disco dance-floor graphics. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter each stage of 8 levels, a new game mechanic will be added, including sliding ice blocks, button-activated walls, and portals.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPress the arrow keys to move the disco ball in that direction, and it will keep moving until it hits something. Also if the disco ball leaves a screen edge, it will loop back in again on the opposite side, making for a very interesting brain challenge. It gets pretty epic!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can also create and save your own awesome levels and let your family try them out later.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T18:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f6/2f6d5eea70a7068ab7f88521c8d43cc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Robert Hendry Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Robert Hendry Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
