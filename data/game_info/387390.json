However, if you don't have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>The Angamanain Empire was always a strange world full of beauty, unimaginable beasts and mysteries and that was before the Basilisk arrived, determined to bring death and destruction to this ancient civilization. Hero, you are badly needed. The Basilisk terrorizes the land. One look from him can kill. He sends out his clones to do his dirty work and they are virtually indestructible.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"Basilisk's Eye\" as your travel destination. It's recommended you reach at least level 75 before taking on the challenges posed by this expansion.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T03:17:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/397/3979953c89449129dfac0937720e9cb4_u6rRsw0.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
