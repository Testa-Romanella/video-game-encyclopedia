Inspired by the \"good old days\" of gaming where you could just sit down and play a few rounds against bots!<br/></p>\n<p>Use swords, shields, bows, magic and even ballistas and more. Upcoming free updates will bring armored horses, catapults and - of course - flyable dragons.<br/></p>\n<p>Watch armies of bots battle it out with ragdoll physics!</p>\n\n<p>I've been working on Dragonfield alone for over 3 years now, doing everything myself - and I am looking forward to hear what you think!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>This first alpha version includes 1 map and a couple of weapons and gadgets to play around with! It is recommended to keep the bot count around 40 for performance reasons, larger counts will be optimized very soon!<br/></strong></p>\n<p>You can check the controls in the pause menu!<br/></p>\n<p>Planned updates include: Rideable horses, flyable dragons, large sieges with ladders, catapults and desctructible environments, a huge variety of weapons to choose from, army customization, full mod support!
