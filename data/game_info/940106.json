I wanted to\u00a0see if I could go from concept to \"finished\" in under a day. I didn't <em>quite</em> make the mark, go over by a few hours, but I still consider it a success. I learned a ton from this exercise!</p>\n<p>Some omitted ideas that may be added if there is a large\u00a0interest:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Daily mutations:</strong> Gain retools, armor, loot roll buffs, etc.</li><li><strong>Collectibles/Achievements:</strong> Ways to track certain outcomes and events. Example, collecting 3 Lunar Fragments unlocks ???.</li><li><strong>Wandering Trader:</strong> Offers healing services, help navigating, etc. in exchange for your SCRAP.</li></ul>\n<p>The cover artwork is a mixture of Public Domain works and my own drawing/embellishing on top.
