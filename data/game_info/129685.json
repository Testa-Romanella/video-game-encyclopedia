Each puzzle has hints scattered inside the mysterious audio file and you'll have to listen closely to figure out the solutions.<br/><br/>This project was created for Global Game Jam 2017 (meaning we created it in under 48 hours). The entire game and all of its artwork was created in a single weekend by Steve Rakar and Michelle Rakar. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b81/b811e28752cb2d684e0f6d96066023bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michelle Rakar", "The Gek Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
