Memories help us understand not only ourselves, but the care and hopes of loved ones and give us strength. Memories remind us that we are not alone.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a short story about a girl who participates in a cycling championship.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is our attempt at storytelling without words.</p>\n<p>Through game mechanics, we wanted to show that it is impossible to learn to ride a bicycle without ever falling. Just like it is impossible to learn to walk without overcoming difficulties. This overcoming of the difficulties of life also makes us who we are and if someone supports us at such moments, then the memories of this are very warm.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>The game is built on QTE game mechanics and some puzzle.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>Mouse.</p>\n<p>Made for\u00a0MiniJam 54: Memories\u00a0in 11 hours. Yes, we started very late, but really wanted to participate. We didn't sleep all night and submit the game 30 seconds before deadline =_=<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sorry for this game, we do not use drugs. We just had very little time, but we will fix it.
