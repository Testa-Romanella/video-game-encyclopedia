When a heavy downpour starts, he stumbles upon a school he's never seen before.</p>\n<p>Premise:</p>\n<p>After School-A Vocaloid RPG is a survival-horror Vocaloid RPG experience created using RPG MAKER VX\u00a0ACE. Playing as Oliver, you find yourself in a \"Spirit World,\" an alternate dimension hosted by a single corrupted spirit.\u00a0You meet new characters, and help spirits along the way while keeping an eye out for the corrupted host spirit. The player must help Oliver escape this world safely, while navigating the dangers it throws his way.</p>\n<p>Heavy inspiration was taken from games such as End Roll and Ib, while the initial inspiration to start this project was taken from the song \"Crushed Mary\" by Mondaiji-P.</p>\n<p><strong>*Extremely important note*: </strong>This game began development in 2016. It does not end with a cliff hanger, and there is a\u00a0scrap room explaining the game's direction,\u00a0but i<strong>t is important to understand the release of this updated but technically incomplete game\u00a0</strong><strong>was intended to provide players (particularly Vocaloid fans)\u00a0an entertaining hour and a half experience.</strong></p>\n<p>I debated on whether or not to mark this as cancelled. However, because of the \"Scrap Room,\"\u00a0<strong>I think the experience itself can be considered complete even if it's technically not a complete\u00a0</strong><em><strong>game</strong></em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>45-90 minutes of gameplay\u00a0</li><li>Original soundtrack</li><li>Original art assets</li><li>Original story and\u00a0characterization</li><li>At least 1 chase scene</li><li>Extra in-game content (the Scrap Room)</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Arrow keys--Move character</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Esc--Menu/Backspace</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Enter key: Inspect/confirm/talk</p>\n<p>Warnings:</p>\n<ul><li>Mild pixelated blood in one area</li><li>Some bullying</li><li>Existential time stuff (minor and limited to an avoidable diary entry)</li><li>Minor jumpscares (mostly sudden noises)</li><li>Chase scenes</li><li>Brief mention of animal death in a piece of dialogue</li><li>Maybe some minor flashing light (?) in one area\u00a0(I'm not sure if it's bad enough to really mention but be aware !)</li></ul>\n<p>Things to Know: This experience is relatively accessible even to people who are not Vocaloid fans.<strong> No prior knowledge is required</strong>, but at least having familiarity with the characters will add a layer of enjoyment. Please note either way that this game is technically considered incomplete and targets the Vocaloid crowd most.</p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<ul><li>Artist/Programmer/Voice Actor/Writer: Eddie/Edlinklover</li><li>Musician: Vane</li></ul>\n<p>Contacts:</p><p><strong>If you want to show me something whether it's fanart, thoughts, etc, tag any of my accounts!

However, hours upon hours of work have gone into this project. I remade almost all the visual assets from scratch and even provided my own voice for parts.
