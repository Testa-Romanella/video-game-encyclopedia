The score goes up 30 every second so to see how long you've survived, you divide your score by 30. To defend yourself and destroy mini Bobessas, you can left-click on them. You can punch baddies for points!\u00a0 Obviously to move, you must use the left, right, up ,and down. Well, just go have fun! Oh, also try to get 1000 points or above!<br/>F4 is for changing size and F9 is for taking a screenshot.</p>\n<p>Me: What are you waiting for?\u00a0</p>\n<p>You: Uhh, what? You can't even see me.</p>\n<p>Me: Just ignore that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08d7cf8790420586f714f94ed5d9c7ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arreyvan Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
