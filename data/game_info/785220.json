{"id": 785220, "slug": "dronebot", "name": "DRONEBOT", "name_original": "DRONEBOT", "description": "<p>Dronebot is my first full FPS game which was heavily inspired by one of my childhood favourite game developers: Psygnosis. It was really fun and creative to deal with the game development process from start to finish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The enemies were implemented by AI behaviours like Behaviour trees Blackboards, state machines and locomotion. An example of AI being implemented is cached geometry because I had an unusual animation for my Drone's chainsaw. There was the implementation of a player stamina system; HUD, for example, mini radar, health and shield; Particle systems like Cascade and multiple sounds. The game is a continuous loop that contains winning and losing conditions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The level construction was fun to build because I want to have that retro gameplay so the lighting aspect was important to implement. I animated the textures which were also important to have that retro gameplay - that was done in Blueprints. I turned a physics-based animation into a shader which enhanced the textures in Dronebot. Mechanics was crucial in Dronebot because my player needs to sprint and slide. The camera shake makes a huge difference when my player is sprinting, sliding, firing and taking damage - this improved the mechanics in Dronebot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game handles pause events so you can pause at any time and that was done in Blueprints. I manipulated my player's armature bone using inverse kinematics. Lastly, the mechanics helped Dronebot because I used a reusable mechanic where I initially have locked doors that requires a specific key to open for my player to progress to the next stage in Dronebot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T16:47:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/6775ee6c47a8c96cd8cfcb8558cd9ebb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OnePersonStudio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
