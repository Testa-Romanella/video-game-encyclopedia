Created for the Weekly Game Jam 145.</p>\n<p>You suddenly find yourself being in an unknown and unsettling forest. Night is rising and you have no clue why you're here or what you should do now.</p>\n<p>The only thing that catches your eye is a subtle light under a tree not far from you. Maybe you should check it out...<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>Still WiP. As you will see some ideas have only been roughly implemented.<br/>Also many assets are not optimized yet so you need a good hardware setup to play it.<br/>I will continue to improve the Game after the Jam is finished.
