One player plays as a thief, trying to steal all three artifacts in each museum, the other player plays as a guard, trying to catch the thief. The interesting mechanic is that the guard cannot see the thief unless they step into light of any kind, so the thief has to be careful. If the time runs out, the thief automatically wins, but guards shouldn't be discouraged, because they gain a speed boost during the final 20 seconds, giving them the edge they need.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam, using the theme Light<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c43/c4341016f528f08d15a766ba6fe62714.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gentle Tortoise"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
