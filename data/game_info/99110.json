A real genocide.</p>\n<p>Earth also seems to be overwhelmed by the assault and only a small group, scouting near Encelade manageto avoid the attack. By approching the icy surface of the moon there is still one last hope of a counter attack againt the ennemy from another world.\"</p>\n<p>Enceladus is a shoot'em up inspired by the Playstation &amp; Saturn era infused with mecanical gameplay and modern artistic style.</p>\n<p>Easy to handle, skill will be needed in order to beat the 7 levels available.</p>\n<p>The player takes control of \u00ab Frost \u00bb, a spaceship capable of firing energy blast or to channel a very powerful laser. He also has the ability to trigger a powerful explosion, ideal to get yourself out of trouble.</p>\n<p>The number one asset of \u00ab Frost \u00bb is his ability to teleport. By a simple push of a button, it is possible to create a ghost of Frost while still defending yourself. By letting go of that same button \u00ab Frost \u00bb teleports to the ghost's location.</p>\n<p>That technology allows you to move faster, to dodge overwhelming shots but also to gain acces to unaccessable zones.</p>\n<p>Teleportation needs practice, but once mastered \u00ab Frost \u00bb becomes so much harder to destroy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0dfdb779f4010e0898a9330bcc36fa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plug In Digital"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
