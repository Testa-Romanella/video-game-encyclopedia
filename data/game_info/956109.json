This a personal passion project inspired by themes of grief and mental health in my own life and inspired by the art workshops and stories from others. Thank you to my class, peers, and friends for contributing to this game: whether it was through class critique, filling out my surveys, or participating in the drawing workshops. I was deeply inspired not only by my own narrative of grief but by everyone who contributed with their vulnerable narratives and art pieces. <br/></em></p>\n<p><em>This is my first time developing a playable video game, let alone using RPGMaker. I am by no means a video game developer and am still learning the world of game design and storytelling. I plan on revising the story, adding more hidden features, licensable tracks, and more interactive functions after I get enough playtesters and after the senior Degree Symposium. I anticipate adding more to this prototype even after graduation. <br/></em></p>\n<p><em>I belong all rights to the artwork, development, and writing of this project.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>keyboard controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u2191 = up</p>\n<p>\u2193 = down</p>\n<p>\u2192 = left</p>\n<p>\u2190 = right<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T11:04:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1f/b1fc0cef596e48055abd8df5707c3b76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["ellayoung"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
