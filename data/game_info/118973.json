The name of the project is 'SKAL' and you play as a small orange cube that has to get from point A to point B as fast as possible. Currently there is no 'lose function' other than the player dying, however it is one of the things I'm currently looking into.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls are fairly simple. WASD or the arrow keys to move around. Shift is for sprinting, and Space is for jumping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would love to get some constructive critiscm on the game in order to make it better.</p>\n<p>The game runs on the Unity Engine.</p>\n<p>PS. Sorry for the sound effects, they might be a little annoying at times due to some bugs. The audio can be turned off in the options menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fdb2d0642bcb91b10806e7caec684a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laursen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
