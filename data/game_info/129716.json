You have to figure out ways to dispose of the boxes before your house is overrun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's a lot that I wanted to put in the game but didn't have time for, and there's only one way to get rid of the boxes, so you likely won't need to play the game very long to see everything in it's current state. Planned if I continue to work on the game, are things you, the player, can buy on the computer in the office to help get rid of the boxes (such as wood for your fireplace, some sort of shredder, etc.). The catch there would be that those items would come in boxes of their own, which you would have to weigh the cost of in terms of the space available in your house. I think it's a decent idea for a game and wanted to finish it, I just had other things come up that I needed to do and couldn't finish it.</p>\n<p> This was made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 42.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD\u00a0to move</li><li>Mouse\u00a0to move camera</li><li>LMB\u00a0to pick up/drop boxes</li><li>F\u00a0to fold boxes</li><li>F3\u00a0to open/close the debug menu</li><li>.\u00a0to spawn a bunch of boxes quickly (no actual gameplay purpose, just there if you want to see a bunch of boxes)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f2e3b87495a4b626c40f48146341ce1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jasperarmstrong"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
