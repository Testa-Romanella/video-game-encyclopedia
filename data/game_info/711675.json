Pretty simple right? let's see how you do it.<br/></p>\r\nWhat you need to know:\r\n<p>You move around with the A and D keys, as you need to get closer to the computer and the deposit managing screen to do your task, see the clients orders on the computer then go to the deposit managing screen to select the products you want in the box pressing the \"Drop\" button when you see the right one as you look through the options. You can also press the \"Box\" button to get a new empty box in case you make a mistake while selecting the products. After that, you can click on the box on the corner to wrap it up and drag it. You can\u00a0pile up your boxes\u00a0 in the shelf right in the middle of the office, but remember; you can't move a box under another! and also remember where you put them because they are pretty similar to one another, afterwards you only have to wait until the client comes to the office and deliver it to them! Be fast, they get angry waiting for a long period of time and be careful, they get angrier receiving the wrong order, so does your boss. Good luck!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Eduardo Machado (@arcticmm) - Programming</li><li>Thiago Okaime (@thiagokaime) - Game Design / Art</li></ul>\r\nSpecial Thanks to\r\n<ul><li>Flipper</li><li>S\u00e9rgio Kunaby</li></ul>\r\nSource\r\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmkERPXVcTa_NuCrn_qRdMOWwYNQkBld/view?usp=sharing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T06:23:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e465f2648b95a31f2845295836f8d93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Okaime"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
