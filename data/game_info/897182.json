Hop on your bike and weave your way through the city to get them safely to their destination, which is the building with a blue glow. Hold the eggs to heat them up, but don't hold on too long, or you'll\u00a0cook them!\u00a0Use your map to guide you and the street lights to predict the traffic patterns. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Oh, I almost forgot!\u00a0You only have two hands, so you can't steer and heat an egg at the same time. Don't get distracted, and have fun!</p>\n<p>Note: Leaning in your chair\u00a0does not help to avoid cars\u00a0in-game, but it boosts immersion.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Move forwards- W or Up arrow</li><li>Brake- S or Down arrow</li><li>Steer- A/D or Left arrow/Right arrow</li><li>Pick up/Set down eggs- 1, 2, and 3</li><li>Map- 4 or M</li><li>Restart- R</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:33:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be2/be2bfaaf530c90bf55a00c92e2e2ef0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kambopoloid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
