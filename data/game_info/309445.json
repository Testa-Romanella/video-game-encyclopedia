It was a fantastically fun challenge and I really enjoyed the process.</p>\n<p>The game is called Fatal Error: Robots Escape.</p>\n<p>You control a blaster at the doorway of a warehouse where all the robots have had a \"fatal error\" and are now\u00a0trying to escape. Each robot has an assigned color, and has to be blasted using the same color energy in order to decommission it. Protect the outside world from the run away robots\u00a0and rack up as many points you can.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Asset Store assets used:<br/>Bolt<br/>Beautify<br/>Master Audio: AAA Sound<br/>Epic Toon Fx<br/>Sci-Fi Styled Modular Pack<br/>Simple UI<br/><br/>Music from bensound.com</p>\n<p>Bolt graph GIFs:\u00a0<em>(on Giphy.com)</em><br/>Hud Manager<br/>End Level Results<br/>Robot<br/>Blaster<br/>Wave Controller</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T03:36:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df5/df5ae6b7c42f8b5d60e7787b523ead23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobby Wolfe"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
