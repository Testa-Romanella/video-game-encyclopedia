But they are fragile in nature, requiring constant care for them to grow in this foreign environment.<br/>As a chef, you need to resurrect the trees and tend to them during the seasons of \"life\", and you will have an unlimited supply of ingredients for your dishes.<h3>FISHING</h3> <br/>Some stray fish also snucks into the underworld from time to time. <br/>Which is extremely good news for you, because which real \"Cat Chef\" does not enjoy a bit of fishing (and subsequently sashimi) on the side?<br/>Choose the time of the day, the proper bait, maybe wait for some rain and enjoy the bountiful harvest of top-notch fish from a place nonother than the river Styx.<h3>COOKING</h3> <br/>The solemn and silent spookies of the underworld wish only to feast on mortal food - the best relief from their grueling travel.<br/>Arm yourself with the cooking utensils and prepare the best dishes you can think of. Your ghastly customers are a bit reluctant to part with their coin, though. <br/>Make sure, to \"woo\" them properly into buying stuff. And be careful, as some of them are daring enough to steal the products of your hard labor!<h3>LEARNING</h3> <br/>Good recipes don't grow on trees. By expanding your catalog of ingredients, you will inevitably learn more recipes to cook.<br/>And it just so happens that ghosts tend to come in batches by their food preferences. Some like dishes with salmon, others like honey.<br/>Make sure you are prepared by learning all the recipes available to you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T02:49:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d0140a442f2e8deca507e6846d2fb0cc.jpg", "website": "https://art-games.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Art Games Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Art Games Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
