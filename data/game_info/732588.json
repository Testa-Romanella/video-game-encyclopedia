You are just two friends playing around at the window. Suddenly a thunderstruck and there is no electricity, it is a BLACKOUT! Another thunder, the light lets you see your friend\u2019s building. You see your friend, he is OK, but he is not alone anymore\u2026 In another room, an evil man is glooming\u2026 Using your wits you\u2019ll have to guide your friend to the exit! Help him get to safety!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game revolves around how your input influences your friend. Your friend only sees your warnings when in a blackout (the flash doesn\u2019t allow him to see, only you). So you can see where your friend is during the flash, but he can only move during the blackout. You win if you can safely move your friend to the exit, but if the intruder catches your friend, you lose! <br/></p>\n<p>Originally submitted to GGJ 2019.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Playstation Controller: Control the lights using the X, Square, Triangle, and Circle;</li><li>Keyboard: Control the lights using the W, A, S, D</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T03:06:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdc1b2d6e097e627b19f528d855f3a2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Quenestil", "TheDarkRyze"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
