Hazard Class 13 was implemented to contain hazards from non-terrestrial biology, which were more dangerous and harder to contain. Positions in the cleanup and disposal of Class 13 Hazards were often exempt from the right to refuse due to a lack of effective containment protocols. It was a job no one wanted to take, but somebody has to do it, and everyone needs to earn a paycheck somehow.</p>\n<p>Determine the species of the alien queen using the investigation tools and hunt it down with your friends in this co-op alien hunter.<br/></p>\n<strong>CURRENT LIMITATIONS</strong>\n<p>Alien queen variants has not been fully implemented, <strong><em>ALL QUEENS ARE SPECIMEN A, MEANING THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE STUNNED USING THE FLAMETHROWER. </em></strong>The game is also missing an instruction screen (which will come with the variants) make sure that you <strong><em>USE THE CONTAINMENT TANKS TO BRING THE QUEEN BACK TO THE ENTRY ROOM.</em></strong></p>\n\n<strong>FEEDBACK</strong>\n<p>This prototype is on itch.io for free temporarily to get feedback on the core mechanics and design of this game. I really value input on how to develop this further. So if you have any:<br/>\u00a0&gt; Ideas:<em> (\"It might be cool if...\")<br/></em>\u00a0&gt; Comments: <em>(\"I didn't like how the aliens attacked immediately\"/It took me a while to figure out...)<br/></em> &gt; Bugs: (even if they look like they're obvious or temporary assets, sometimes I forget about them)<br/>\u00a0&gt; or Suggestions<br/><br/>Please let me know either in the comment section or in my discord here<br/>https://discord.gg/3GEVcpbUjZ<br/></p>\n\n<strong>JOINING DEVELOPMENT</strong>\n<p>I'm currently considering having some extra people join me in a Revshare capacity. So if you think that you fit an area I'm missing send me an email (applicationstation15@gmail.com) with the subject \"Hazard Class Development\" and maybe some of your work or whatever.</p>\n<br/><strong>Controls</strong>\n<p>WASD - Move<br/>F - Use<br/>G - Drop<br/>LMB - Fire/Use Tool<br/>RMB - Secondary Tool<br/>Space - Jump<br/>MMB - Spectate<br/>ESC - Bring up options menu</p>\n\n<strong>FAQ</strong>\n<p>I can't connect to my friend?<br/><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I was too lazy to build matchmaking so you need to use https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/<br/></em>Where do I find my IP Address.<br/><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Go to https://www.whatsmyip.org/ for a global connection or have your host type ipconfig into the command line.</em></p>\n<p>What's the port number?<br/><em>7777<br/></em></p>\n\r\nCan I play this game without friends?\n<p><em>Yes, but it will be much harder and less fun, you might also need to lure the queen closer to the entry room before stunning her.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T05:54:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/189/1892dc2f0e12ae80827e6da8a4ad8eb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nebulexgame"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
