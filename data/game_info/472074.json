Too bad (for him) that it's not a very stable program. Can he escape before his incompetency causes Dr_Pixel.exe to fail?</p>\n<p>At his disposal is an arsenal of firearms that are well suited for pixelating all the enemies that stand in his way. But to play around with the big guns he first needs fill some weird green bar, 'cause game mechanics.</p>\n<p>This game was created in 72 Hours for the Geta Game Jam 12. The theme for the jam was 'unstable'.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD for movement (the spacebar also works)</li><li>Q to slow down time temporarily</li><li>E to dash</li><li>Escape to pause the game.</li><li>Left click to shoot (You need to hold the button for the minigun)</li><li>Scroll for switching between weapons (You start out with only one)</li></ul>\n<p>Requires OpenGL\u00a03.3+.</p>\n<p>You may or may not need to use the version without particles (Though the old issue with this should now be fixed).
