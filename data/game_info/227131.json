You have for this several ordinary gear wheels of different sizes. You can move them and connect them to each other. With their help you have to transfer the rotation from a green wheel to all other wheels. <br/><br/>A smooth movement of your finger, no reference to the grid. You can move by millimeters, catching a rotation moment. An absolute freedom, a variety of options of puzzle solutions, A good training for your brain. Train your intelligence in an exceptional game.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- Thousands levels, with new trials constantly added.<br/>- All puzzles are open at once.<br/>- You can create your own levels.<br/>- Play exciting levels created by other players.<br/>- Spin blue gear wheels with your fingers.<br/>- Visual themes to choose from: wood, metal, ice, paper and stone. <br/>- Physics Puzzler, Physics-based gaming.<br/>- No time limit.<br/>- No WIFI?
