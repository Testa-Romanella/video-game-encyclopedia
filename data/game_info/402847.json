It's a Zombie Survival where the player must build certain items with parts collected from the map and bosses to build an escape portal out of hell. Horrors lurk around every corner. The map is a giant cave like maze in the depths of Hell. Resupply your ammo at the end of each round and see if you can make your way out of pits of Hell.</p>\n<p>Game is now officially released. Slay the enemies and make sure to stay alive.\u00a0</p><p>Game does not have the parts feature implemented yet. That feature will take a long time to develop and I hope you can be patient enough to wait for that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e82548e6c8b889993da55ef753a4497.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IMPULSE SLY"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
