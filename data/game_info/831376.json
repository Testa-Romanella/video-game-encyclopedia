I have uploaded a sort of pre-demo work in progress here that shows off the systems I've built so far. I should be updating it fairly often with each new feature. All sounds are only placeholders and will be updated.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Library's Guard,\u00a0</em>you will explore an island full of magic. The Library, the only government body of your town, has built a new research lab. Here they combine the magic found in old tomes and journals with new technology to create all kinds of contraptions (the new potion vending machine in front of the Library for example). You have been hired as a guard to keep their research out of the wrong hands. Despite the security, a shipment of magical tomes was stolen before it could make it to the Library. Now you must track down these powerful books and return them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Explore the Island and adventure through dangerous dungouns to find the missing books. Uncover the people and motives behind the theft. All while the Library's lab makes new advancements in combining technology and magic that changes the town and helps you on your quest.</p>\n<p>Please leave a comment to let me know what you think! If you're interested and would like to know more, you can check out my instagram here and be on the lookout for a pre-campaign Kickstarter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T16:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efd0751854ee316db83120dc1fd77a7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dev Bee"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
