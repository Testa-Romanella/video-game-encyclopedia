This is my Christmas gift to you. Every year, I try to make a tiny game for Christmas. This one I did for me; you probably won't like it. It is intended that you leave it open on the side as you do other things. At least that's how I play it.</p>\n<p>Vaguely inspired by Vesper5 and by my new lava lamp.</p>\n<p>See ya!</p>\n<p>\u2014narF, Dec 2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98c64d22c00ebabd3ca907fc94e05c55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["narF"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
