Endless waves of bigger and bigger beasts came forth with only one thing in mind: eating everything they encountered on their path. Humanity is now in shambles except in a couple of places where giant walls were built to defend against the unstoppable tides of destruction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only a couple of individuals crazy enough dare to adventure outside the walls, to collect rare creature parts that sell for ludicrous prices on the black market. You are one of those people, a name that everybody in this circle knows, famous for its efficacy and its otherworldly magical powers; you are: The Wizard\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Spells</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Choose from 3 different spells-type ranged weapons what\u2019s the best to deal with the innumerable waves of demonic enemies: the lightning-fast dagger, the massive scythe, and the groundbreaking axe.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Elements</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Imbue your weapons with foul elemental energies, exploiting enemy weaknesses to mow down hordes of raging enemies. Use fire to slowly kill monsters without even watching, ice to slow down the faster menaces, and thunder to spread the pain between enemy ranks.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Tree</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Gather experience from defeating your foes and use it to unlock powerful upgrades that most suit your playstyle: will you choose to be The Runner, The Expert, or The Elementalist?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Codex</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Find valuable pieces of ancient knowledge and dig into the story of GogMajus. Why did the Earth get invaded by otherworldly entities? Where do these monsters come from?
