Fortunately, the viruses are isolated to a\r\nsmall sector of the hard drive for now, but if they aren\u2019t eliminated soon,\r\nthey may spread to the entire system, wreaking havoc on the user\u2019s programs and\r\nfiles! It\u2019s time to send in VirusHunter, the top name in antivirus software, to\r\nscan the sector, delete all threats, and ensure the user\u2019s system is secure\r\nonce again!</p>\n<p><strong>The Game: </strong>The game is a very brief (about one minute\r\nlong) light gun game controlled via mouse. Shoot the enemies with the left\r\nmouse button, reload with the right mouse button. Once all visible enemies are\r\ndefeated, the camera will move to a new position to reveal the next group of\r\nenemies. The game ends when all enemies have been destroyed or the player runs\r\nout of health from being attacked.</p>\n<p>I had planned to include friendly \u201ccivilian\u201d programs for\r\nthe player to rescue, but that proved to be too ambitious for the time\r\nallotted. I also had to scrap more complex enemy behavior other than \u201cstand\r\nstill till the player can see you, then walk in a straight line towards them.\u201d\r\nStill, despite its simplicity, I\u2019m pretty happy with how it came out. It might be cool to do a bigger project like this sometime, one where I don't have to figure out how to get it all working in 48 hours!</p>\n<p><strong>The Jam Theme:</strong> The theme for the first Extra Game\r\nJam was \u201cAwesome Per Second,\u201d taken from an Extra Credits episode of the same\r\nname. Immediately upon hearing this, I was fairly certain I would tackle\r\nsomething action-oriented. However, I re-watched the episode to see if I could\r\nfocus in on an idea. The idea behind \u201cAwesome Per Second\u201d was, essentially, cut\r\nout the fluff, only keep the stuff that makes a game \u201cawesome\u201d and skip the\r\nboring parts.</p>\n<p>After that, I zeroed in on the idea of doing a light gun\r\ngame. I\u2019d been wanting to prototype this idea for a while, being fond of these\r\nsort of games whenever I\u2019m able to visit a video arcade (which isn\u2019t often). Some\r\nof my favorites are The House of the Dead 2, the Star Wars Trilogy game, and\r\nGhost Squad (all by SEGA, incidentally. They\u2019ve got this genre nailed). These\r\ngames also fit the idea of \u201cAwesome Per Second\u201d very well due to their format.\r\nWhile home console games are meant to be experienced over the course of several\r\nsittings stretched out over weeks or months, arcade games are meant to be much\r\nbriefer diversions and therefore their players will have much shorter attention\r\nspans. If an arcade game loses its player\u2019s interest, they\u2019re going to go spend\r\ntheir quarters on something more exciting. Therefore, to keep players hooked, light\r\ngun games go from one action set piece to the next, boom-boom-boom, until the\r\nend of the game (assuming the player can even get there!).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c86/c86672d6d0fdeec8cd9b886c10563eea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dragon King Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
