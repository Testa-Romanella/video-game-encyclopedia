I know the art doesn't look great, I'm a programmer so I'm artistically challenged.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I did have to change the idea 16 hours in as I had overscoped massively and needed another idea so I didn't drown in imposter syndrome.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm reasonably happy with it, I know it isn't a masterpiece and I\u00a0know I'll be quite far down the leaderboard, but for my first 48 hour game jam I'm very happy with the progress I made and the result of it all.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0would have loved to have included a WebGL version, but the build didn't work and I started to run out of time.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:45:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/521576581589b396fbed20e403ac8db4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JagubSmof"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
