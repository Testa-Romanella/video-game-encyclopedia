I was SO wrong to think I\u00a0could handle it - but hey, I hope you'll appreciate the effort and have a good laugh too! What I mean is that\u00a0only half of the dialogues are completed. Most of the text follows the order of the file - the first sections of the game and UI should be almost fully localized. The remaining text was\u00a0kept in English.
