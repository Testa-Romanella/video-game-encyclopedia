To include RayTracing modeled after methods used to make \"X\" and \"Faceball 2000\".<br/><br/>Sadly due to needing floating-point data, mathematics and such the project is stuck on final stretch of having a walking simulator. (was halfway through the scientific denomination before the timer ran out)<br/><br/>Anyway proper scalable vertical scan-lines was possible and it can be scaled from 1 tile up to 8x8 tiles. The whitebar is just a visual element by setting the current column of tiles to white, before these are redrawn to black. If removed, the screen will only update the current column of pixels.<br/><br/>Up-to-date source code you can find here:<br/>Github - Tech Demo Project<br/></p>\n<p>Source is provided for those that want to continue this project or want to create their own implementation on this base. <br/>! This project uses GBDK as devkit !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T07:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4c/f4c7447bca2f2315b4c5e041288b214c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PSPiso"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
