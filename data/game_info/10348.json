There\u2019s an adorable robotic companion who pops up from time to time to offer cryptic advice, and tons of interesting environmental details. (...) People who want to explore a striking new land in a relaxing fashion will be in heaven here. Adding to this are some interesting puzzles. An early one that involved rearranging pieces of a coil to reactivate the ships engine was simple and clever. Traversal puzzles that goof around with gravity are a delight to solve as they force a level of three dimensional thinking that is satisfying to solve.<br/><br/><strong>VR Focus</strong><br/>The world that Carbon Studio has created is a fantastic mix of sci-fi architecture and bizarre dreamlike scenarios.
