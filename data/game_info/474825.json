A different experience. You may prefer this though, let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:26:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/251/251a25d689fcc6a5ada9959a9ffaea1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rugeon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
