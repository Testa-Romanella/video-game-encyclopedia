You play as a father who must safely transport his child through a treacherous backyard full of monsters, and reach the gate safely.</p><p>This game is in prototype / experiment mode because, even with two months to work on it, being a working father takes up a lot of my dev time. My goals were to get the basic engine done, and have something playable and loseable by the end of this jam. I hope to expand on this further, or at least use the engine to make another roguelike.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/977c0004414453031c4d3325ff54b91b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jonathan Hirz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
