Instead of reaping souls, Thanatos, the Angel of Death, has to deal with his teenage daughter Prim. Every night, Prim has the same dream: An oddly familiar human boy cries out for her help. Needless to say that our heroine tries to answer the call. There\u2018s just one tiny problem: The Grim Reaper has strictly forbidden her to enter the Realm of the Living \u2013 she\u2018s not ready for the immense power she\u2018d develop there, he claims. Unfortunately, when Prim finds a way to trick her father and travel to Earth, it painfully turns out that Thanatos\u2018s presentiments have been right all along...\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt its core, PRIM is a story of a father learning to let go and a girl finding out who she really is. But it's also a thrilling adventure, full of magic and darkness. On her journey, Prim repeatedly has to switch between the Realm of the Dead and the Land of the Living, where she faces demons, real ones and ones within herself, while always being accompanied by her sidekick, an eye with spider legs.\n<br/>\nKey Features:\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Hand drawn HD artwork and traditional frame-by-frame animation</li>\n<li>Simple one-click interface</li>\n<li>6-8 hours of varied gameplay</li>\n<li>Atmospheric orchestral soundtrack</li>\n<li>Control multiple characters</li>\n<li>In-game hint system, hot-spots and fast-travel</li>\n<li>Mini games, such as a deck-building card game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T09:35:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c63/c635892187a98f20ba90e26b913aa417.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Application Systems Heidelberg", "Common Colors"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Application Systems Heidelberg"], "esrb_rating": null}
