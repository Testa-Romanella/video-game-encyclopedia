Gameplay is bound to be buggy and almost pointless. This game is designed for the Oculus Rift + Touch (Sorry vive users). It may work on the vive, I\u00a0honestly have no idea.</p>\n<p>Shoot robots before they shoot you! If they shoot you, nothing happens, because that makes total sense. If you shoot them, they die. Try to kill all the robots without getting hit, and you will gain an immense feeling of satisfaction. Trust me.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A and X:\u00a0Teleport around, and have a great time!<br/>B: Reload your gun, and shoot more robots!<br/>Right trigger:\u00a0Blast those robots to pieces with your gun.<br/>Joystick:\u00a0Rotate left and right, because why not.<br/>Y: Teleport dash forward, with cool sound effects! Use this to try to avoid the robots.</p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy this 20 seconds of gameplay thrown together in a few hours :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cc/7cce88598842ae236889c5c51bbedb02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheCircuitLord"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
