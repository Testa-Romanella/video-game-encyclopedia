It's inspired by air traffic type games.</p>\n<p>This was a my first real programming project, something I had started 6.5 years ago. I decided to dig it out and port it to OUYA for the 2019 OUYA game jam. This sort of thing is exactly why I bought an OUYA back in the day, although I never got around to publishing anything. Seeing this jam inspired me to revisit it.</p>\n<p>I didn't see the jam until the day before it ended so game is pretty much as it was. The conversion from touch controls ended up a little clunky. I had built this game completely from scratch, no engines or 3rd party libraries. I tested on 1080 monitor and it looks alright. Tested on my 1440 phone and I wouldn't recommend it, haha.<br/></p>\n<p>The graphics are very crude and some things are unpolished. The original vision for the game had a number of additional play modes that I never got around to. I'm not sure if I'll have the time or motivation to tackle those things. My experience working on it in the last 8 hours is that the code is really bad. :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T05:11:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e14/e148acac426766d236ddfbda66b15b92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["DOODYsandwich"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
