So, I had learned all about the beef industry from several sources, all with their own unique perspectives on the practices and overall merit of the meat industry. My favorite source by far was Temple Grandin, as she was appealing to the industry to instill higher standards for animal living conditions, treatment, and slaughter. She was't talking to us about the beef, she was talking to the ranchers. I loved it. But that's not exactly what this game is about.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis game is a depiction of what I think the most apologetic in the industry see. This is how the YouTube videos from ranches in Iowa want you to believe the process is. Sure, they don't exactly lie to you, but they don't give you a complete picture by any sense. This also reflects what I've seen from even educational programs meant to take away the mysticism of meat, but it ends up painting a much brighter, happier picture than reality. Game Maker let my creativity flow. As ideas came and went, I was able to test anything I wanted as long as I took the time to figure out how to do it. What started as an exercise in mechanics, became a platform for my emotional and social ideas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7db/7db78b6d75e2bb044f86f8dc3961a2fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["andycastaneda"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
