I had one month to complete it and it must be 30 minutes  long at least. I couldn\u2019t 100% complete it as the last battle not  balanced that well with a temp sprite. So please keep this in mind.\r\n    </p>\n<p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 <strong>Game</strong> <strong>Back Story</strong> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\r\n    </p>\n<p>Jolly is a \u201cdefected\u201d kitsune, meaning she can\u2019t transform or grow  more tails like they normally should. She is basically an outcast in her  town and can only get by doing quests at the guild. One day a quest  came up specially for Jolly and her two fox familiars. She has to  explore a forest to find a said rare item. But will her adventure stop  there?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>*Possible Trigger Warnings:</strong> <em>Hinted at Suicide, Hinted at Rape</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 <strong>Game Features</strong> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\r\n    </p>\n<ul><li>Frontal Battlesystem (Use of skills, Casting system, Use of Items, Cooldown system, Buffs, Debuffs)</li><li>\u00a0Random Battles</li><li>An Item Shop</li><li>\u201cExploration\u201d</li><li>3D Camera Plugin</li><li>7 Bad Ends\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T15:36:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/592/592f5535f00f16dfda042dcf6a4e1b76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TsunamiJurai"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
