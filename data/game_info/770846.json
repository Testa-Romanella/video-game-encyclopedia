I also worked on creating a Time Dilating Mechanic which is the Unique Selling Point of the game alongside more mechanics that make the game fun to play. This project also focused on allowing me to create an extensive Games Design Document.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T15:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36eeb7d009323abdb431a956174159be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Konstantin Kanev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
