COMET.Q does away with all the complex mechanics and delivers a streamlined experience fit for a modern age.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game adds an optional twist in that it gives you the choice to up your score by using an ability called \"Shiftphase\" which you can activate by turning your phone 180 degrees around. With Shiftphase, you get extra points and can slow down time for a moment.</p>\n<p>To help you get used to the double paddles on both the top and bottom, COMET.Q gives you three lives that are lost when you miss the ball but can be easily regained by hitting the ball with the paddle again.</p>\n<p>How long can you last?</p>\n<p><strong>=== This is Blockbreaker. Redefined. ===</strong><br/><br/>Built for maximum efficiency and for our indefinitely busy lives, Comet.Q\u2019s short burst gameplay brings you an energetic rush that will challenge the limits of your skill, no matter your age. Coupled with ultra smooth responsiveness, feel no stress as the game takes you on a ride that will thrill your senses.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>=== Everyone can play this game... ===</strong><br/><br/>Optimized for accessibility, Comet.Q brings one-touch control to a new level, one that allows every individual to play the game. Set in portrait mode and streamlined for both thumb and finger gameplay, you'll definitely feel at ease with playing the game, so play it your way!\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>=== ...But not everyone can beat your highscore. ===</strong><br/><br/>Made for Co-op. Strengthened for Solo play. Comet.Q delivers three game modes all in one game without any fluff or paywall. Everything is available right off the bat, so challenge yourself in solo mode, or challenge your highscore with a friend. Don't like playing against the score?
