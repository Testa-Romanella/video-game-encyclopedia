So I wanted to try to create what I\u00a0would consider to be the perfect 2-player battle game. It is very easy to learn but can take a long time to master, since there are tons of special items that keep the game interesting:\u00a0lasers, rotators, ball spin, multi-ball, brick wall, bomb, cannon and even a frog that will bug your opponent.</p>\n<p> You can also play against a computer. Set the AI level to 99 in the settings to get a really difficult AI opponent!</p>\n<p>Play with a shared keyboard, a touchscreen or with two game pads!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:04:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/939/939631f2cbd728e9d35246ec2aaafc9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ecation"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
