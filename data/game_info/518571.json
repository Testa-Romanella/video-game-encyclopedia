Also, the size, glow and opacity can now be modified via sliders on the UI. I modeled a 3D clock which follows the system time, and allowed the user to interact with the clock's hour hand and AM/PM toggle to change the time of day completely and compliment the user's painting experience. Lastly I added a feature that allows the user to toggle rotation of the paint objects using the UI.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T07:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f91/f91e32e74e4de403b45f64c0fc431932.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["amangrover72"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
