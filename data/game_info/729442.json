I wanted to make interactability but the trees themselves took a longer than expected amount of time.\u00a0 So basically it's a forest growth simulation. However, it's fun to walk around in so I am submitting anyways. The intent is that these are apple trees and as they grow the player can pick them up to plant elsewhere, however, because I didn't get that (admittedly important) feature in, I have it randomly offset the apple by up to 10 meters and then drop it there, this way the forest can grow on its own. The apples also will fail to grow into saplings if they are under another tree (not enough light) and fail to grow into mature trees if they are too close to another mature tree (limited space or resources). </p><p>WASD to move, Esc to close the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T03:47:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d00c5e2d46254d48cfb6e0223f0eb34d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LiamCrowley"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
