Basically, your head is the only important part for you.\u00a0Yes, you can go through your own snake, but your shiny, floating and\u00a0opaque body covers everything under you. Including food. And projectiles. And\u00a0enemies.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Enemies.</p>\n<p>You can shoot them.</p>\n<p>Press space to do it.</p>\n<p>And standard WASD to move your snake.</p>\n<p>Also I suggest changing your console font because it might be too small.</p>\n<p><em>Note: this is a quickly put-together prototype that I wrote in a few hours, further development of the project might happen, but I'm not sure yet. I\u00a0wonder if I'll be able to afford college by making this game.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T05:57:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/beb/beb3d3d092725207e39f326c172f01b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["danteclava"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
