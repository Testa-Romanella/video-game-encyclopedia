I named the individual patterns \"vulcano\", \"tornado\", \"cloud\" and \"wave\" so \"elements\" seemed fitting for the overall intro.</p>\n<p>Enjoy</p>\n<p>Marc</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T14:40:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28cbd607f57977cd6a1b5e647e2c3c57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jetset entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
