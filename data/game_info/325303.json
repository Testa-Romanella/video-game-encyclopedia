Just drag and release to set angle and speed. While dragging a preview of the trajectory will show! Shoot fire at gun powder, or place particles in orbit...<br/><br/>Particles are attracted to a black hole at the center of the canvas.<br/><br/>Optionally use the accelerometer as added force.<br/><br/>Add different elements to the simulation, see planets getting formed, plants grow,...<br/><br/>Particles react with each other, for example when ice and fire touch the ice will melt. Fire will burn plants. Any particle touching the \"Drain\" particle will disappear...<br/><br/>Physics engine tracks individual particles for a realistic simulation. You can see particles orbit the black hole.<br/><br/>Meteors create spectacular explosions on hitting other particles.<br/><br/>The current simulation is saved on exiting the app and automatically restored on restarting the application.<br/><br/>Check out the full version (\"Meteors\" ) as well.<br/>Full version adds :<br/>- Editor for the force field : add white holes, black holes, gravity shields. This feature allows you to create different kind of simulations.<br/><br/>- Saving and loading your simulations.<br/><br/>- Full version does not have ads.<br/><br/>==&gt; if you like this be sure to check out the full version.<br/><br/>Please send suggestions for future versions! For example what type of particles would you like to see.
