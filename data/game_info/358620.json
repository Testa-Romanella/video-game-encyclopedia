You play as a youngster who returns to his old hometown, and who wants to reconnect with his old buddies. Before long you will be discovering ancient evil, blasting hideous monsters and saving your friends from the hands of an evil cult. <br/><br/><br/>\r\nThe game will be an atmospheric horror shooter, kind of like a story-oriented version of <em><strong>Blood</strong></em> seen from a topdown angle, mixed with<strong><em> Blair Witch Projec</em>t</strong> and Stephen King. Ctulhu mythos will play its part in this game's design as well, as we already danced around the idea in earlier concepts. Hybrid Children will be a continuation of sorts to our previous Steam game <strong><em>Kalaban</em></strong>, this time realized as a fully 3D game. <br/><br/><br/>\r\nThis time around you can play the game in couch coop with your friend, not just in survival mode, but in story mode as well!\u00a0The game will be hitting Steam early access later this year.\u00a0</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________<br/><br/>We have set up a Patreon page where you can follow and support the game, or get the downloadable build from Itch.io.\u00a0Show your support by downloading the early test build, and giving your feedback on the game directly to us.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>If you have talent in 3D character art, we would love to work with you!
