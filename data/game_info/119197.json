{"id": 119197, "slug": "ripple-itch", "name": "Ripple (itch)", "name_original": "Ripple (itch)", "description": "<p>Currently in a pretty incomplete state.</p>\n<p>A giant squid is enjoying a normal everyday swim when something \r\nterrible happens. In the meantime, you and a friend (currently circles) \r\nare trying to get from A to B. A loooot of squid ink is slowing them \r\ndown because one of them (spoilers: not you) has a morbid fear of ink. \r\nTo get where you're going, you need to build a bridge from one side of \r\neach ink pool to the other.</p>\r\nInstall instructions\r\n<ol><li>Download the latest build zip file and unzip anywhere</li><li>Run the .exe file inside the zip</li>\n</ol>\r\nStuck?\r\n<p>Pressing R will restart the current level. Pressing shift + right click will discard the current piece. Alt + F4 closes the game (sorry!).<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong>: move<br/><strong>Click</strong>: Attack (move mouse to swing)</p>\n<p><strong>Shift + WASD</strong>: rotate your current bridge piece into position<br/><strong>Shift</strong><strong> + Click</strong>: Place your bridge piece<br/><strong>Shift</strong><strong> + Right Click</strong>: Discard your bridge piece</p>\n<p><strong>R</strong>: Restart current level</p>\r\nGeneral info\r\n<p>When pieces are near each other, they will increase in size to show which pieces will connect. Be careful placing the final piece of a bridge - make sure both ends of the bridge increase in size before trying to place it.</p>\n<p>You can attack enemies to stop them hitting you. You lose the current level if you get hit by enemies three times.</p>\r\nContent to add\r\n<ul><li>Graphics for main characters</li><li>Graphics for spiky frog enemy</li><li>When starting a level, show without ink. Then, splatter ink everywhere while main character is trying to cross.</li><li>Better attack / swing mechanic</li><li>More levels past the tutorial stages</li><li>Pre-placed bridge pieces in the level which can give bonus points if passed through</li><li>Start / end art stills</li><li>Swinging a piece breaks it, and it must be discarded. Hitting multiple enemies with a single hit will be a useful strategy</li></ul>\r\nFun things\r\n<p>New things that went into this game that were fun to learn about</p>\n<ul><li>re-implementing some basic physics engine functionality (circle-circle collision resolution, line-circle collision resolution, line-line collision detection)</li><li>Water ripple effect, using this code as a base: http://unitycoder.com/blog/201... and this site to (kind of) understand the logic: https://web.archive.org/web/20...</li><li>Bridge-building mechanics using a radius and a list of \"connection angles\" for each piece</li><li>Using Unity Runtime Animation Controller https://github.com/newyellow/U... to animate the squid</li></ul>\r\nAudio credits\r\n<p><strong>Sound effects</strong><br/>Bridge attack swish: https://freesound.org/people/I...<br/>Enemy / bridge water splash: https://freesound.org/people/y...<br/>Next level gong: https://freesound.org/people/j...<br/>Enemy blowing up: https://freesound.org/people/G...<br/>Enemy bursting: https://freesound.org/people/b...</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong> (Under the license https://creativecommons.org/li...)<br/>Track 1 - Wategos Boogie by The Underscore Orkestra http://freemusicarchive.org/mu...<br/>Track 2 G # # Plucky by The Underscore Orkestra http://freemusicarchive.org/mu...<br/>Track 3 by The Underscore Orkestra http://freemusicarchive.org/mu...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e4/5e491f19bf96ac40ecbeee34cb3e483b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Splerp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
