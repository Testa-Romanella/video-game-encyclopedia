Trump!</strong>BackgroundSome may call this propaganda. Others may say it's gloating. While those assumptions admittedly may have a shred of truth to them, my hope is that most see this game as I do ... as a fun, light-hearted but sincere salute to Donald J. Trump's amazing and successful run for the U.S. presidency. However people see it, this was just something I had to create ... so I did!GameThis \"mini\" game consists of 6 \u201cbattles\u201d between Donald J. Trump and a handful of the enemies he faced during his campaign, namely:<br/><br/><ul><li> Fake News<br/></li><li> Southern Border<br/></li><li> Protesters <br/></li><li> Hollywood<br/></li><li> The Swamp<br/></li><li> \"Crooked\" Hillary</li></ul><br/>The gameplay is meant to be more of an entertaining experience than a hard-core gamer challenge but I've tried to make it a decent mix of both. <br/><br/>With each battle win players can choose to upgrade their health (HP) for future battles or get more \u201cWinning Coins\u201d to unlock additional hats and outfits.<br/><br/>The first battle is free and if you enjoy it you can purchase the other 5 via the DLC:<br/>http://store.steampowered.com/app/676080/Super_POTUS_Trump_The_Full_Game/.<br/><br/><strong>Long Live the God Emperor! #MAGA!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T19:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a3/9a37430d3ff6ffba2f2f0e5132a65557.jpg", "website": "http://apps.chris-emerson.com/SuperPotusTrump", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 140, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emerson Design"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Emerson Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
