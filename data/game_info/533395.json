The objective of the game is to roll around the floating objects and reach the goal to proceed to the next stage. However you won\u2019t be able to move in the conventional sense. While the ball is against a surface, the player can\u2019t directly influence its physics and will need to jump before it can alter course. With 3 levels to roll through, will the marble still be bouncing?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T07:30:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000cac10082474b1960e80c1624df860.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoMorris"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
