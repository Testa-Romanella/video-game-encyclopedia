Our world is a unique version of the lands dominated by the myths and legends of Its Inhabitants. Various tribes interact with one another, engaging in diplomacy, war, and expansion. This game is <strong>not</strong> historically related and doesn't include any real tribe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We have crafted an <strong>open world rife for exploration and conflict</strong>. You will interact with the various tribes of indigenous people. That alone can make for a compelling gaming experience, but there is something more. Something much darker that lurks in the forests and wilderness. In the corner of your eye and the slight cracks in the earth. Also, <strong>to survive alongside your fellow tribals, you must learn caution!</strong> Creatures born from the minds of men and spirits that terrify the soul are talked about in hushed voices around campfires by storytellers and shamans. In the world of Ayash, they are very real, and the monsters of this world must be fought lest you lose your life or your soul to beasts, both natural and profane.<br/><br/><h3>List of Included Monsters:</h3><br/><ul><li>Djiein<br/></li><li>Aglemus<br/></li><li>Bloodflies<br/></li><li>Crawlers<br/></li><li>Burnt Monsters<br/></li><li>Wendigos<br/></li><li>Werebears<br/></li><li>Werewolves<br/></li><li>Wudies<br/></li><li>Tizheruks<br/></li><li>Flying Insects<br/></li><li>Onyares<br/></li><li>Cavemen<br/></li><li>Rock Monsters<br/></li><li>Saumens<br/></li><li>Tizheruks</li></ul><h3>Native Monsters</h3><br/>You must change your tactics to survive the ever-changing world around you. <strong>You are prey.
