That's it... basically\u2026 But what else do you need?</p>\n<p>I really wanted to make a game that would scratch that itch. You know the one.\u00a0The feeling of a perfectly entered turn, or a sniper riffle\u00a0headshot in a fps game. Of a perfectly executed combo attack.\u00a0Of one box fitting perfectly into another. You get the idea.</p>\n<p>Which is why I spent two days to make DRIFTR. Actually, I've been trying to create a game like driftr for many years, and went through three or four iterations. shoot' em up, card game, strategy. They were fun, but something was lacking. I think DRIFTR is what I was looking for. It has been my favourite game ever since it started to work, and I have been playing in on and off for almost two years.</p>\n<p>So I decided to share it, maybe somebody will enjoy it as much as I do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/315/315d035ab3b22588ea5f2783b256a769.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Oleg-Avdeev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
