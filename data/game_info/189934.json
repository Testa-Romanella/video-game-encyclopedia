I hope to polish it up and add more content in the future. <br/></p>\n<p>This is a physics based platformer. Roll and jump around the platforms squashing bugs. Roll into the purple square to complete the level and try not to fall off. Explore for bugs off the obvious path for a higher score.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Up Arrow - Jump</p>\n<p>\u00a0Down Arrow - Slam</p>\n<p>\r\nLeft Arrow - Roll Left <br/></p>\n<p>Right Arrow - Roll Right</p><p>Note: I am aware that the game crashes when changing levels and replaying the level after death. Currently working on a fix for this issue.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ea/7ea6a113d0f7c3d68a69a93eaf4f2643.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kavinci"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
