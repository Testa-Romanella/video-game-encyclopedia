Use your power siphon to leech power from other robots, make sure to fully drain them or they'll turn on you and call for backup. They've all been built better than you so if they've noticed you then you can't siphon them until they've backed off. Luckily, they're pretty stupid for intelligent robots. We trust you to outsmart them (tip - they can't actually see through walls or machinery even if it looks like that way).</p><p>Source and credits available at\u00a0https://github.com/dirty-casuals/V.Ampere</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aea/aeaf4bde207a259573d5348963b9a426.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dirtycasuals"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
