Incorrectly guessing the \n      differences will force the player to start over and try to spot the \n      differences again. Every ten levels, the game changes things up with a \n      minigame.\n    </p><p>\n      Fun for the entire family!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac6/ac6f606e43843417f71c472f8dcd60be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Enjoy Gaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Enjoy Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
