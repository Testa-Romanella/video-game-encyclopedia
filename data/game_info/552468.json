But, now that all your family has either been starved or killed by officers of the state, you demand change. Convince the masses and build a crowd massive enough to storm the palace so that the old regime topples and new leadership can emerge. You must be willing to say whatever, do whatever, the less you hold to your morals, the more allies you can gather.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Info:</strong></p>\n<p>Use WASD to move.<br/>Click on the dialogue buttons to speak.<br/>Each level you must get enough civilians across the gate to continue. The more you positively influence the crowd, the quicker they follow you. But be careful, after you sound the alarm you only have 10 seconds before the authorities arrive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Game Design - AnnaAD</li><li>Programming - AnnaAD</li><li>Art - AnnaAD</li><li>Black Vector Silhouettes - Royalty Free Art from wikipedia,\u00a0 pixabay</li><li>Map Made with - https://probabletrain.itch.io/city-generator</li><li>Man Yelling Sound, Door Slam - freesound.org</li><li>Music \"The Warsawian\" - Historical Sound, Marxists.org</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:11:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/904/90446f750ac654e215d83055b958fbb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["AnnaAD"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
