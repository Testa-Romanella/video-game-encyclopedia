They're capturing races from all planets and putting them in alien zoos to make fun of. Save Earth by battling them in mind games and see who is actually better, faster, and smarter!<br/></p>\n<p>Made for game development course as part of my studies, Number Snatchers is a basic arithmetic game where you learn how to add up numbers correctly. It's targeted towards kids to make addition and subtraction fun.</p>\n<p>The game was intended to be larger; including subtraction and wild cards. Plus, it was planned to add exploration and enemy engagements similar to classic Pokemon games, which lead you to battling different enemy types and styles. Unfortunately, due to the little time available for this project, and the team being busy with other courses, we had to cut it short to what it is today.</p>\n<p>There is a possibility to revisit this project in the future and add these missing elements to the game. When will that happen, is currently unknown.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b87f28c9909e72903ac9e8e9972c0f8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shenawy", "irys"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
