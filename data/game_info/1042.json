The tracks are decomposed into diverging game mode segments. The obstacles, tracks and visual effects are all adjusted to the music and in perfect harmony with each song. Dub Dash has a great soundtrack including music from Bossfight and the DJs of Geometry Dash \u2013 to enjoy the full experience the use of headphones is highly recommended. <br/> <br/>ULTRA CHALLENGING MODES <br/>Spin your crazy wheel in harmony with the song and keep dodging left and right avoiding obstacles at high speed. Fly like a bird, make hard 90\u00b0 turns and feel the rhythm of the zig-zag trajectory. The objective for each track is clear: Do you rock the funky road of Dub Dash?<br/> <br/>PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT <br/>The gameplay of each segment is simple but it\u00b4s tough to master the levels. Actually it\u00b4s extremely hard, almost impossible \u2013 but fortunately there\u00b4s the practice mode which gives you a save point after each passage so you won\u00b4t need to finish the whole level in one try. Memorize each segment of the level and maybe (only maybe) you will be able to master even the hardest levels someday. <br/> <br/>FEATURES:<br/>- Rhythm based action game<br/>- Great soundtrack including Bossfight and DJs from Geometry Dash<br/>- Challenging levels with groovy tracks and stunning effects to the beat of the music<br/>- Different game modes requiring fast reactions<br/>- Practice mode<br/><br/>Requires iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad mini, iPod touch 5th gen or newer!<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram: <br/>www.facebook.com/HeadupGames  <br/>www.facebook.com/DubDashGame<br/>www.twitter.com/headupgames<br/>www.twitter.com/DubDashGame<br/>www.instagram.com/headupgames<br/><br/>If you have problems with the game or feedback please send an email to: support@headupgames.com<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Photosensitive Seizure Warning <br/>A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these &amp;quot;photosensitive epileptic seizures&amp;quot; while watching video games. <br/><br/>These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. <br/><br/>Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms - children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. <br/><br/>The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions:<br/>\u2022Play in a well-lit room<br/>\u2022Do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued<br/>If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b95/b95acc81a23d7907563b0457f79519da.jpeg", "website": "http://www.dubdashgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Headup Games"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Headup Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
