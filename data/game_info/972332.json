If you encounter any problems in the game, please leave a message or contact me.<br/><br/><br/>Story background:<br/><br/>With the recent technological advances, humans have achieved lunar colonization. Meanwhile, humans have established a joint scientific research institution on the moon to conduct scientific research. Through controlled nuclear fusion technology, humans have successfully obtained fuel from lunar rocks for nuclear fusion and realized wireless power supply and artificial gravitational atmosphere to ensure that the oxygen and pressure around the base are maintained at near-earth levels.<br/><br/>Due to anomalies in the moon's orbit, the human base on the moon is frequently attacked by unknown creatures. Currently, humans have evacuated the relevant personnel of the lunar base. Now, as a military scout, you are sent to the moon to investigate the anomalies and find solutions to the problems.<br/><br/>Stage 1: Survival<br/><br/>You wake up from the lunar base and the first thing you need to do is to maintain supplies and energy, and find ways to survive. Explore and collect raw materials, produce essential items.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stage 2: Defense<br/><br/>There are often attacks from unknown creatures around the spacecraft docked in space. You need to strengthen the defense turret construction to ensure that the spacecraft is not destroyed so that you have hope of returning to Earth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stage 3: Exploration<br/><br/>By developing your own equipment and supplies and increasing endurance, you can go to surrounding buildings and mysterious places to explore treasures, discover anomalies and mysterious spaces, and solve crises. At the same time, you can establish branch base constructions, allowing yourself to have temporary shelter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stage 4: Solve anomalies<br/><br/>You will encounter different mysterious bosses, collect their drops, open hidden spaces, solve the final problem, and return to Earth or continue your leisure travel on the moon.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T09:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f454b36336d01408d83c4d761e0015e3.jpg", "website": "https://www.themysteryofthemoon.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HUANG MEI ZHAO"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HUANG MEI ZHAO"], "esrb_rating": null}
