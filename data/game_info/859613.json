And not just that but your closest subordinate just told you that you\u2019ll have to be working through old cases at an extreme pace today.\r\n</p>\n<p>Instructions:\u00a0</p>\n<p>* Read the case presented to you in this box and then press the correct punishment\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0based on the perpetrators characteristics and the laws from the lawbook on the\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0right.<br/><br/>*\u00a0 New laws will appear for every case. These will in many case contradict each other\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0but you are to judge according to the HIGHEST possible punishment (we go hard on\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 crime here).<br/><br/>*\u00a0 Fail too many cases and there will be consequenses.<br/><br/>*\u00a0 Get through the pile to save your career.<br/><br/>I was way too tired this weekend to actually do this well but in the interest of preserving my Ludum Dare\u00a0streak I at least made something. It has a bit of humour at least and while I almost ripped my hair out trying to make Godot export it correctly I did at least get a Windows version at last. I\u2019ll see if I can get a web version on this itch.io later. This was my first time ever touching Godot which was a bad mistake to make for a gamejam. Too much googling in too little time\u2026<br/>I also had no time for sound or music despite my love for both so there is an eerie silence thing going on.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope to perform better next LD. :)</p>\n<p>Here is the link to the LD submission if you want it:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/quick-to-judge</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ff/9fff1e4ad4709ac26070ebd5168f05ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anfallsigelkott"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
