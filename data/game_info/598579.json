It isn't much of a game yet though. I\u00a0learned how to \"open\" chests and doors in the game, how to use Unity's particle system,\u00a0and also how to set up a UI with health and XP bars.\u00a0\u00a0I tweaked a few things personalizing this game, so it doesn't look like the tutorial original. I hope to work more on it in the future to make it a game worth playing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T08:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ca/5ca61cf2e925c2daf9419ddcb534172a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maribell"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
