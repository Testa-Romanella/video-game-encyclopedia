{"id": 862048, "slug": "secure-contain-pursue", "name": "Secure, Contain, Pursue", "name_original": "Secure, Contain, Pursue", "description": "<p>'Secure, Contain, Pursue' uses the NextMind brain-computer interface to create a unique horror experience. The player traverses an obstacle-laden urban cityscape on a mission to detain a dangerous entity called \u2018SCP-173\u2019.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The NextMind sensor uses non-invasive EEG (electroencephalography) technology to translate active visual focus to an executable command. An event (like a button press or mouse click) can be triggered when the player \u2018focuses\u2019 on a specifically tagged object in the game. The NextMind Sensor is worn as a headband with a sensor attached to the head.</p>\n<p>This game\u00a0is based on the SCP Foundation lore. The player is sent by the Foundation to locate and disable SCP-173. This entity is based on the original SCP-173 and it sneaks up on and chases the player via teleportation. However, the player can \u2018focus\u2019 on SCP-173 to hold it still and prevent it from teleporting. To end the game, the player must navigate through the dark and winding city alleyways to assemble a device that can be used to disable SCP-173, or face its wrath.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T11:03:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/573/5734e29ed932d88ed9ee1074d9fdbd1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikki"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
