When the timer is over, you'll have to fight a powerful boss using only the weapons you've managed to create!</p>\r\n Extras \r\n<p>Additionally, there is a secondary game mode you unlock when you get a certain high-score: \"Demons\". It's a little arcade mini-game added just for fun :) You can watch a video about it here.</p>\r\nAny problems?\r\n<p>The game shouldn't have any problems :) <br/> ...But if you <strong>do</strong> encounter a problem, feel free to contact me via my email (address can be found in my itch.io profile).</p>\r\nNote\r\n<p>This game is only available for Windows. I'm sorry, Mac and Linux users, but I don't want to distribute a file I didn't check. The Windows version was checked several times to ensure it's working properly, but I don't own a Mac/Linux computer, so I can't check if those files work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5f2979d4c713c71c60faf6115e5acae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bip Studios"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
