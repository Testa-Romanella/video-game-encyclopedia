{"id": 931247, "slug": "cyclic-conundrum", "name": "Cyclic Conundrum", "name_original": "Cyclic Conundrum", "description": "<p>\"<strong>Cyclic Conundrum</strong>\" is a challenging puzzle game that combines three different types of puzzles to keep you engaged and entertained.</p>\n<p>The first\u00a0type of puzzle is a <strong>Jigsaw puzzle</strong>. You will be given a scrambled image, and your task is to put it back together by rearranging the pieces. The catch here is that the image is circular, which means that you will need to think outside the box to solve it.\u00a0 <strong><em>(Before starting the puzzle, you can click the next option to get some more jigsaw puzzles)</em></strong></p>\n<p>The second type of puzzle is a W<strong>ord matching puzzle</strong>. You will be given a set of words, and your task is to match them with their correct meanings. The catch is that the words are all jumbled up, so you will need to unscramble them first before you can match them with their meanings.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The third and final type of puzzle is similar to <strong>Sokoban</strong>. You will control a character who needs to push objects around a room to their designated spots. The catch here is that the objects are arranged in a cyclic pattern, which means that you will need to carefully plan your moves to avoid getting stuck. <em><strong>(You can press the reset button to get a new level and next game to move on)</strong></em></p>\n<p>When a puzzle ends, there is the beginning of a new puzzle (I know this a very rough implementation of the theme, but let's just ignore and move on)<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Each level presents a new challenge, and you will need to use your problem-solving skills to overcome them. So, if you are ready for a brain-busting puzzle adventure, play\"Cyclic Conundrum\" today and put your skills to the test!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T08:09:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec5/ec5ab48e5eef924cbf85956eb6d71798.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Swayam2004"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
