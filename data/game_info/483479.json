Well, be thankful you're not clumsy Magician's Assistant, Brando. He accidentally dropped boss's\u00a0spell book into a cauldron of acid (who just keeps those lying around, amirite?), and spawned a whole mess of zombies! Angry with his clumsiness, Brando's boss cursed him\u00a0to forever randomly turn into different animals, unless he can clean up his mess.</p>\n<p>The only way to break the curse is to kill off all the zombie's he accidentally created. Use our swift attacks as a snake or powerful blows of a living tree to kill zombies, but be wary of their attacks if you happen to be a mouse!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Movement - WASD or Arrow Keys</li><li>Attack - Moving into the same square as an enemy initiates an attack</li><li>Exit Game - ESC (at anytime!)</li></ul>\n<p>Each of your forms comes with custom stats!
