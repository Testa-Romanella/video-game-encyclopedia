The engine used is\u00a0<em>Quandary</em>. It has been heavily adapted by me for this project. The ZIP file weighs in at a\u00a0<em>whopping</em> 39KBs (including images). The raw files are not much more than 100KBs.</p>\n<p>Every game designer, I suppose, tires of using bloated engines to construct their games. This project is minimalist in design, but with a surprising number of features.\u00a0<em>Quandary</em> offers the non-programmer a simple means to construct and deploy their creations <strong>without bloat</strong>. If you are interested in creating a minimalist interactive fiction Gamebook/CYOA, I believe that you cannot go wrong using the Quandary engine.</p>\n<p>For people who like to PLAY Gamebooks/CYOAs, I hope you enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:50:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63bcda6e4c2652f6cebfce15306ac2d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John C.
