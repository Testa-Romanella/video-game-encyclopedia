{"id": 459324, "slug": "lucid-2", "name": "Lu:Cid", "name_original": "Lu:Cid", "description": "<p>Lu:Cid is an unfinished Yume Nikki fan game made for Dream Diary Jam 4. Inspired by Yume Nikki, of course, as well as Soul Void.</p><p>This is pretty much my first game made with RPGMaker, and I learned a lot in the process. Thank you for taking the time to check it out.</p>\n<p>Contains: mild horror atmosphere, some autobiographical elements but overall is a work of fiction with a dreamlike meditation on quarantine life. Very empty right now, lots of events though. 3 \"effects\" and 2 cats to find.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: As of present version, uploaded 6/28/20...</strong></p>\n<p>-You do not need to eat. This was a planned feature that was incompletely implemented.</p>\n<p>-Weapons serve no purpose at this time.</p>\n<p>-Tarot is incompletely implemented and is not needed to progress.</p>\n<p>-The book \"Jekyll &amp; Hyde\" still needs to be formatted properly, but the bookshelf is still useful for reading the credits.</p>\n\n<p>Planned Updates\u00a0(In Order of Priority):</p>\n<p>-Jekyll\u00a0&amp; Hyde will be properly formatted so that it can be read in-game.</p>\n<p>-More worlds, more effects, more cats!</p>\n<p>-More (public domain) books. A book is, in many ways, like a dream, don't you think? It's a little experimental, and has no impact on gameplay, so feel free to ignore this feature.</p>\n<p>-Tarot card reading system will be implemented. Readings will be conducted like combat, and the \"enemy\" cards will yield abstract concepts as item drops. This is inspired somewhat by the story progression in games like Fallen London. For example (and this much should work in the game) drawing The Fool will sometimes yield the item \"Opportunity.\" There is an obstacle\u00a0which cannot be moved without \"Opportunity\" in the player's inventory; though there is nothing yet beyond this obstacle so it's not really worth trying out. Since the player character puts some stock in tarot reading, the cards will affect their dreams. Good cards may influence good things to happen in the dream, bad cards may influence bad things to happen.</p>\n<p>-Once the major arcana is fully implemented, I would like to add the minor arcana.</p>\n<p>-Graphical improvements. Tilesets and sprites were sometimes rushed for the jam, and could benefit from some polish.</p>\n<p>-Hunger mechanic, possibly. I initially planned on this but have questioned how fun it would be in practice.</p>\n<p>-Reduced overall jankiness.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>Viola Pasquarello for believing in my project and providing some awesome original tracks!
