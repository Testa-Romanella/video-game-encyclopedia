Control the feisty little construction vehicle and watch it burrow its way through the perils of an underground world. Players dig through the dirt horizontally and vertically to create paths, collect jewels and coins, avoid monsters and falling bags of gold in single and multiplayer modes. Return to Eighties' arcade roots with the Vintage mode that replicates the original Digger\u2122's old-school vibe. Detailed, high-end graphics and a playful, cutting-edge techno score make Digger HD a retro gaming experience unlike any other. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCreat Studios, Inc. \u00a9 2009, Creat Studios, Inc.
