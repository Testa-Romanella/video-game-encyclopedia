It's your job to make it fit! <br/>Aand there's bunch of action happening on foreground to distract you. <br/>And that's not all, it get's bit harder the longer you play it. <br/>I hope this doesn't sound too disturbing to you, so give it a try! <br/>Please tell me how you made it! (your best highscore) <br/> <br/>Also controls can be first bit tricky, but I think you can manage. <br/> <br/><strong>If you have any trouble: </strong><br/>There's this darker shift-block to guide you how your shape is going to look <br/>like before you change to it with Shift-key. <br/>The trick is that you need to try to shapeshift just before the walls! <br/> <br/><strong>Controls:</strong> <br/>ARROW-KEYS or WASD to change shape <br/>SHIFT to hold a shape (uses stamina) <br/>ENTER to restart the level <br/>ESC to go back to menu/exit game.(don't worry, your highscore stays there as long as you have the application/web-page open) <br/> <br/>All sounds are made with microphone and using Audacity. <br/>3Dmodels with Blender3D and simple shapes in Unity3D. <br/>Unity3D used for making the game using C# in Visual Studio. <br/>That's about it. <br/> <br/>Tell me what did you like or not? ;) <br/> <br/>PS: you can follow me on twitter: @Jukepoks1 <br/>also for sending links to your gameplay &amp; give feedback! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acd/acdaa5e9b12a03593be5cc8f4436fa33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Jukepoks1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
