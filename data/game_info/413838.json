Get a high score and learn a little about sailing.\u00a0</p><p>Controls: A and D to turn the rudder, W and S to change the trim (angle) of the sail\u00a0<br/></p><p>Helpful tips: <br/>- If you are luffing, your sail is not catching the wind. Try adjusting your trim or turning away from the wind<br/>- What trim to put the sail depends on the angle of the wind. Generally, the closer you are to opposing the wind the closer the sail should be to the center line of the ship<br/>- Sailboats cannot sail directly into the wind</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T05:01:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e8758210b4e96a2a002fc5c6d9183af6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["greycompanion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
