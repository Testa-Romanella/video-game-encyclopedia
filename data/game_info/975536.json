Such incidents sometimes happen and now it has happened to you. From now on you have only one task - to find 8 pictures and leave this strange place. <br/>In terms of gameplay Eyes Of Memes is a classic indie horror in which you have to explore the location in search of pictures.  You don't have any weapons, you are always defenseless against the inhabitants of the place and if you encounter them, running away is the only way to escape.<h3>Levels</h3>You just went to sleep in your cozy bed in your home and when you wake up you find that you are in some dark creepy place... There are 6 levels available to you in the game: Morgue, School, Basement, Game Room, Backrooms and Desert. Visually all levels look different, but your goal is always the same - explore the location and collect all the pictures.<br/><br/><h3>Hazards</h3>Watch out if you hear strange noises or notice something moving in the dark. The inhabitants of this world only at first glance look funny and ridiculous, but they are not! Run. Don't stop, don't try to hide, just run! The creatures that inhabit this place are far more terrifying than anything you've seen before.<br/><br/><h3>Eyes</h3>While wandering through this strange place, you can discover mystical eye pills that allow you to look through the monster's distorted minds.<br/><br/><h3>Progression</h3>For successfully completing levels, you will earn experience points that can be spent to unlock new levels and enemies. Playing on a higher difficulty level will require more effort, but you will gain twice as much experience.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T07:15:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44d/44da95375ae4967735d1c96cd0974f2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astra Playroom"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Astra Playroom"], "esrb_rating": null}
