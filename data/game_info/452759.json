And Wolfram said that he didn't know, and that he had just enumerated the outcomes. And then Feynman said, 'awe good, I\u00a0thought you had some intuition that I\u00a0did not'.<br/>[AI Podcast #89 with Lex Fridman]</li><li>Even the great minds who dedicate themselves to it wholeheartedly, are still left puzzled when it comes to knowing how these types of systems behave (without running simulation).</li><li>Don't be discouraged. Just try things out and see what happens.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Background:</p>\n<p>Built\u00a0for Ludum Dare game jam #46 in 48 hours by one artist/programmer.<br/>Theme: keep it alive.</p>\n<p>Ludum Dare is a global game jam that happens twice a year. This was my first time participating in which\u00a0I\u00a0had enough free time set aside to not be totally kidding myself that I\u00a0would finish.</p>\n<p>John Conway, who was known as a brilliant mathematical thinker,\u00a0passed away not long before this game's publication. He will be greatly missed and his work continues with an enduring life of it's own.<br/><br/><br/>Plans vs Outcomes:</p>\n<p>Initially I had planned to release this\u00a0game in webGL format (as I'm doing now), but I had been a bit too hasty in my development process, and the game completely broke under changing resolutions. I had an hour left in the jam - and I\u00a0scrambled to release something. The final product was a windows only download with a fixed screen window-size. I made it with just 2 minutes left on the clock.<br/></p>\n<p>This release is identical to the original game-jam, except that I have included more background information and\u00a0formatted it for the web.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:42:58", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aztec_man"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
