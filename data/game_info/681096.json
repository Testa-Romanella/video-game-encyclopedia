You also have a few of a single healing item if needed.</p>\n<p>The game automatically resets when either side wins. You'll have to click in the game window after starting it or toggling full screen for the controls to respond. If you do decide to play in full screen (which would make sense), I'd advise you pause before doing so.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype for the game's battle system, so any feedback is greatly appreciated. I hope you'll try the full game when it's finished!</p>\n<p>Have fun, and good luck not exploding!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T07:14:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/556/55601358366772744becd8bb80956e7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Giggle Tail"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
