Aliens have copied our olympics and have got it all slightly wrong. Sponsors will randomly take control of events and twist them to fit their agenda creating havoc for the athletes. <br/><br/>With an almost endless number of event and sponsor combinations Glurp has masses of replayability. Just when you think you are getting the hang of an event, you get laser hands! <br/><br/>Each arm of the athlete is controlled independently with the controller's analogue sticks. You can grab with each arm... and that is it. Super simple, but hard to master! <br/><br/>Glurp supports up to 20 players and makes for a great spectator game \u2013 expect lots of shouting and cheering! Designed to keep the action going with drop in and drop out and defer turn features. One controller is all you need.*** And now a word from our sponsor ***<br/>MAXIMUM COLOUR, ZERO TASTE<br/><br/>DRINK MORE GLURP<br/><br/>Glurp believes in giving you the very best in beverage technology. With maximum colour and zero taste, Glurp gives our athletes the edge when competing in the games.<br/><br/>AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE NOW", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0f/b0f96611e80c202153d3529a4d25e552.jpg", "website": "https://drinkmoreglurp.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 85, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CATASTROPHIC_OVERLOAD"], "genres": ["Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CATASTROPHIC_OVERLOAD"], "esrb_rating": null}
