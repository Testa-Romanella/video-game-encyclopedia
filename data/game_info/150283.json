{"id": 150283, "slug": "spotlight-waltz", "name": "Spotlight Waltz", "name_original": "Spotlight Waltz", "description": "<p>A simple puzzle game in the style of early 90's arcade, with a theme of synesthesia. Made in Fall 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>For the best experience, please play with headphones correctly adjusted to your left and right ears.</strong></p>\n<p>The goal is to move the cursor around the screen in the right directions to reach the end of each level. The quicker you move, the more points you will get, but be careful not to get carried away!</p>\n<p>Each spotlight color corresponds to a different direction:</p>\n<p><em>Red=Up</em></p>\n<p><em>Blue=Right</em></p>\n<p><em>Green=Down</em></p>\n<p><em>Orange=Left</em></p>\n<p>Also, as you progress, you will find some new items:</p>\n<p><em>The directional tile reveals a part of the path for you.</em></p>\n<p><em>The fog tile makes it harder to distinguish the tile's colors, but sound is also your friend!</em></p>\n<p><em>The reverse tile indicates that the following tiles will have their colors reversed. Up is down, left is right, and vice versa.</em></p>\n<p><em>Mines will explode as soon as you move your cursor into them! Try to avoid them or they will make you restart your level! Thankfully, you can observe their movement patterns.</em></p>\n<p>With a total of 50 levels, it's most enjoyable if you calm down and slowly look for the solution. You can try as many times as you want - you'll eventually find the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c02/c023c69ee3b5e19e92e5c6eeae1c7b56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jojogape"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
