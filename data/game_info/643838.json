No? <strong>Well, in my case, the answer was \"YES.\"</strong> Imagine Jimin from BTS... Being a dog. <strong>Thus, <em>My New Pet?</em> came into being!</strong> <strong>Featuring seven different endings, there's bound to be re-play value!</strong> To be honest, I do not remember the title of the absolutely powerful fan fiction that inspired my work, but its memory lives on in the form of this game. This game was made as a joke, is a joke, and forever will be a joke. Don't take it personally if you are a BTS or Jimin fan. And lastly, if this game has gotten even as much as a smirk from you in response to it, then I have done my duty.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T05:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf310cf68e84dcfb4c0ebbd18abaf3b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aristocratic Axolotl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
