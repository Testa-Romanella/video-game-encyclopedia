I was not able to finish it all in time, so be warned, this build is really rough! I'll finish this up post jam!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Arrow keys: Move left/right\u00a0and aim up/down<br/>Z: Jump, press Z mid-air do make a small double jump<br/>X: Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>Idea</strong><br/>As the game lacks any context here's a summery of the general idea:<br/>Your goal is to finish 2 levels and reach the throne to win. <br/>If you die on the way your spirit will leave its mark on the world in the next rounds, this can be anything from reshaping that part of the level, adding more enemies or dropping bonus items!<br/>Your spirit name is displayed at the bottom. At the top you see which area you're in. All starting areas are \"wastelands\" until a spirit takes over that space.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I'll try to finish this project as soon as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T07:46:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e78/e788f84e1964527d1f0c74620e6aab22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["arrpii"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
