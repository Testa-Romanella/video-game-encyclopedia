You play as Io'e (pronounced \"yo - ee\"), and your task is to use the glowing aubs that circle you\u00a0to climb the lighthouse and rekindle its light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's one small problem, however. There's currently no light to rekindle. The game doesn't quite live up to our original vision, and what we do have is largely untested. That's where you come in! We've listed the game as a prototype as we are eager to see it grow and evolve into the game we know it can be, and we'd love to hear your feedback and advice on the matter. But go easy on us! We're still fairly new at this ;)</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>W - A - S - D =\u00a0Movement</p>\n<p>Space = Jump</p>\n<p>Left click = Throw aub</p>\n<p>Right click = Teleport to aub<br/>(currently there's a bug that means you often have to shoot two aubs before you can actually teleport)</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>INSTALL</strong></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Extract the ZIP file anywhere you like and simply double click the .exe (PC)\u00a0or app (Mac)\u00a0file to play.</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>THE CREW</strong></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>| ---\u00a0Daniel ---\u00a0|<br/>Twitter:\u00a0@thedanielkemp</p>\n<p>| --- Sasha\u00a0--- |<br/>Twitter: @KwitchlangDev</p>\n<p>| --- Siriah --- |<br/>Twitter: @SiriahRiah</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>We have used a few plugins and assets (all attained from the Unity Asset Store).
