This does not mean that my next works will be developed with this theme, simply, I thought it was appropriate to do it in this way, taking into account the possibilities offered by the Bitsy platform. <br/></p>\n<p> I recommend playing the game with sad piano music in the background, such as Yiruma - River Flows in You.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy it and that you leave me your comments.\u00a0 Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/780d55af866171b22b5c3e7b2a76b616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FoxerTheBest"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
