I've really stepped up learning Unity, on top of many other skills to bring a game out for all to play and share in hopes I can keep being a developer for the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>What is Holo Battle Network?</em></p>\n\n<p>Step in to a world much like our own but set much into the future. Augmented reality and Holograms have advanced to\u00a0\u00a0create incredible experiences for the gaming world. Holo Battle Network was created \u00a0and became a super popular game due to allowing players to explore their surroundings to catch, battle and compete against Holo Battle Trainers in ways above and beyond the competition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the advance of Hover Tech the world has stepped in to a new era of movement. Jumping, rolling and running\u00a0is a breeze\u00a0 with all the coin collecting, questing and stopping off at the vending machine for a quick drink.\u00a0\u00a0You'll find it hard to become tired. :)</p>\n<p>HomeStead.</p>\n<p><em>Home area.</em></p>\n<p>The in-game home is the video game area. Begin the tutorial and then begin your journey in AR mode. Battle Holo Pet monsters and take on their quests to improve skills, and abilities through the Holo Talent Tree system and Trainer Talent Tree system.</p>\n<p><em>Battle Trainers</em></p>\n<p>The trainers are ready and waiting to dish out challenges and offer rewards for beating their pets once you're strong enough.</p>\n<p>Complete local quests.</p>\n<p>Collecting coins and battling for coins to complete goals will also reward the player with newer access modules to VR realms!\u00a0</p>\n<p>VR realms.</p>\n<p>Virtual reality is mind-bendingly superior in the future. Going in to the VR realm offers exploration to Holo Realms where Holo Monsters dwell.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Holo Battle Network is now around 1-2 hours long and I'm completing the demo for you to come and play. I will only be releasing Holo Battle Network on Itch.io like all of my games. Maybe this one can be enjoyed allot more by the community seeking an experience similar to Pok\u00e9mon Go and Digimon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is not a bait game. It's a real project. Check out the video and please support. It's surely expensive work and exclusive pets will be redeemable by supporters.</p>\n<p>Music.</p>\n<p>Holo Battle Network will have some seriously awesome Synthwave music that'll get you excited and possibly keep you up all night.</p>\n<p>Future progression to consider.</p>\n<p>Holo Battle Network will be a Co-Op / Multi-player game by 2023. I'm panning out the single player and it takes quite allot of work. :O\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T07:39:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92e/92ec10832017c0b470f2f3c2e9472d1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Alexanda"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
