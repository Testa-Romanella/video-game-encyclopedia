Like the butterfly effect, a small action can have unforeseen consequences. Stranded on the isle of Acadia, a small but important island off the mainland of Ralvan, you must find your way through Blight-ridden camps, dust storms, vicious bandits and killers, dangerous wildlife, and above all else, your own pitiful self, with only one goal; to find her. Nothing matters but her, your sister, robbed from you by cultists in the night. Forced into choices that will decide the fate of Acadia and its people, what will you do, what will you sacrifice, in her name?<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay Features</strong><br/>- An active battle system, where your weapons and skills matter less than your skill and focus.<br/><br/>- Over 600 hand-crafted locations, from soaring mountains, to deep woods, to dark caverns below the earth...<br/><br/>- Willing followers, bound by love or duty, whose goals may differ from yours...<br/><br/>- Seven factions, each serving their own purpose in Acadia.<br/><br/>- Choices. The fates of people, each with their own lives, or bigger than that.
