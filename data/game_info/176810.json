You are faced with an ever-shrinking play field as you frantically avoid enemy fire and falling blocks all for the highest score possible. Balance risk and reward as you battle your way through waves of enemies. Just when you think you're safe, then you're met with fearsome enemy generals and monstrosities. You are not alone, your ship has been retrofitted with the ability to use alien weaponry turning their strength against them. Now go, the Earth's fate is in your hands.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frozenpeppers"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
