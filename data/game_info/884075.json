You're trying to reach space with your rocket, that only has the durability for 20 seconds of flight. Try to fly as high as you can to beat your own highscore!</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Hold Space to fly your rocket, while trying to dodge certain obstacles. Clouds, planes,\u00a0balloons and stars do not count as obstacles, so you can fly right through them! The Booster, well, gives you a boost and the Redbird (flying thing) completely halts you. There's also the timer, that counts up to 20 seconds (without the countdown). Once the timer is up, you're done!</p>\r\nRecommended Requirements\r\n<p>RAM: 4 GB</p>\n<p>CPU: Intel Core i3 9100</p>\n<p>Graphics Card: AMD Radeon RX 570</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T13:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/9339af1199ebff006d9d1f096503224c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Diazz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
