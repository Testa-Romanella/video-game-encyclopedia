The story follows a TV crew from America, who has journeyed to research and film an expose on the urban myth of Hanuda, the Vanished Village. Frozen in the 1970s and surrounded by a red sea, it is said that an ancient curse has been set upon this town. The introduction of western characters to Siren Blood Curse brings a new dimension to the series and, in order to survive, they must defend themselves from the vicious Shibito, the living dead, and other terrifying monsters. Throughout the game you play each of the visitors to the village, while the game&#39;s unique Sight-Jack System enables you to switch seamlessly between the visions of the hunted and the hunters. As the plot thickens you discover you are stuck in a time loop in which events eternally repeat and change.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2008-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-29T18:05:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/dfc/dfc5307c35e9d6f664b476cce66611e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.55, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 13, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 27, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 561, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 20, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["SCE Japan Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
