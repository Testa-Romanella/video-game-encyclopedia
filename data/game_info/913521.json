I also started late, so this game is <strong>extremely incomplete</strong>, and I missed the submission deadline for the jam by 1 minute!<br/></p>\n<p>Assembly part: Base building (assembling buildings etc). A bit basic, but I couldn't think of anything else.<br/></p>\n<p>Optional Temperature mechanic: Droids running the base are damaged by the extremely high temps during the middle of the day and their batteries are drained by cold in the coldest part of the night. Droids can be returned to barracks for protection and recovery.<br/></p>\n<p>Expand your base to collect alaments and, at some point (possibly not this version) deal with or defend agains the locals.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD or arrow keys to move the camera drone</li><li>Middle mouse button drag to rotate the camera drone</li><li>Mouse wheel to zoom in and out</li><li>Left mouse button for pretty much anything else</li></ul>\n<p>Limited functionality:</p>\n<ul><li>It is possible to send the droids exploring\u00a0.</li><li>The droids can be recalled and redeployed to/from the barracks. Droids recharge and repair while in the barracks.</li><li>Place some buildings (mostly non-functional).</li></ul>\n<p>I will do some more work on this game to get a better prototype. I will publish that separately, as this page was supposed to be for the game jam only...<br/></p>\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>Most of the buildings are missing or not working.</li><li>Built on Beta 14 of Godot 4, so\u00a0 there are probably engine bugs that I am not aware of.</li></ul>\n<p>Mac and Linux builds:</p>\n<ul><li>No testing on either of these platforms. I do not know if the game will run in either environment.</li></ul>\n<p>Made in Godot 4 using the Forward+ renderer (so may not work on all PCs).<br/></p>\n<p>If you like the concept and think it is worth further development beyond the prototype (barely) done for GWJ#53, please leave a comment and I will keep working on it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T06:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f488669756bdeb51fcede59436bae9cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cymbalis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
