The more whiskey you pour, the more likely you're clients are to pay you. But you have limited time: less whiskey poured in each glass means less time wasted, which translates to more clients served and more money earned at the end of the day. At the end of every day you'll have to keep up with some expenses. If you finish the money or if you're unable to keep up with the expendes you lose.</p>\n<p>I made the game for the Blackthornprod game jam. I had very limited time this week so I wasn't able to do all the things I had planned for the game. I have many ideas and this is just a prototype, so if you'll like it i will update it and slowly improve it.</p>\r\nMusic: Roots that burned our boots - Jahzzar", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:35:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/287/287a935a545f0ee5877dd71d88ab15d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TommyMP16"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
