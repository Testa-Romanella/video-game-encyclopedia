Thanks to the training with the many anime girls, Nyanco has become very powerful and all that remains is to save her world. In order to achieve her goal, Nyanco passed through the magic gate with the sword-spirit, but she arrived in the Gensokyo world in the Touhou Project instead!<br/><br/>After playing for a while with some of the fantasy town's villagers Nyanco had finally found a way back to her original world. However, in order for a new magic gate to be opened, it requires the use of many special magical spell cards. Though because of someone's mischief, those cards have been spread across the  Gensokyo world as parts to a new card game.<br/><br/>As a result, the new card game has been gaining popularity in the fantasy township. Nyanco now has to collect all kinds of different cards so she can open the new magic gate. Keep in mind however, that this card game could be  addictive enough to make you forget who you are. Can Nyanco overcome this adversity?
