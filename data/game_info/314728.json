Unfortunately I had less than a day this weekend to work on the jam, but i'm happy with the small, easy game that came out of it.</p>\n<p>You play as a necromancer trying to gather enough life canisters to summon his own zombie army and overwhelm the skeleton hordes. Between each level you will have the option to lose some life points to summon zombies. But beware, taking away too much life could put you in a bad situation later in the next level! Avoid hitting the skeletons, skelecopters and pits while collecting the soul canisters to get the highest score possible.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Spacebar - Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a4adfc42b5f1d9a61889bcaeb7f6063.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Amatwiedle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
