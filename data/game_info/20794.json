{"id": 20794, "slug": "prismatica", "name": "Prismatica", "name_original": "Prismatica", "description": "<strong>Prismatica</strong> is a puzzle game with a brand <strong>new twist</strong>, inspired by Rubik\u2019s Cubes, Sudoku, Dodecahedrons and way, way too much caffeine.<br/><br/>The goal is to unscramble a series of puzzle boards by rotating multicolored pieces to match a logical pattern. It\u2019s easy to learn and simple to play but surprisingly deep and difficult to master at later levels, presenting even the most veteran of puzzle enthusiasts with brain-tickling challenge.<br/><br/>Prismatica's aesthetic design and feel is intended to be calm and essentialist, presenting the player with a pure puzzle to focus on solving in a flowing natural way. A hauntingly beautiful soundtrack from award winning indie folk musician Svavar Knutur reinforces the stoic atmosphere of contemplation and mental challenge presented by the deceptively simple looking puzzles.Features<ul><li> Brand <strong>new &amp; innovative</strong> puzzle type<br/></li><li> Old-school rotational <strong>chromatic combination</strong> mechanism<br/></li><li> Clean <strong>essentialistic style</strong> and design aesthetics<br/></li><li> Breathtakingly <strong>beautiful music</strong> by <strong>award winning</strong> indie folk musician Svavar Knutur<br/></li><li> <strong>Simple</strong> gameplay that's <strong>easy</strong> to learn<br/></li><li> <strong>Challenging</strong> puzzles that can be <strong>difficult</strong> to master<br/></li><li> <strong>Intuitive</strong> and straightforward controls<br/></li><li> Calmly tackle <strong>48 lovingly hand crafted puzzles</strong> in your own time or test your wit and speed in the new <strong>Challenge Mode</strong><br/></li><li> Now includes <strong>color blind mode</strong> for added accessibility</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3e/b3eca9e5ff6fecd3135e78abbec2a4a1.jpg", "website": "http://loomus.com/prismatica/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 76}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Loomus Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Loomus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
