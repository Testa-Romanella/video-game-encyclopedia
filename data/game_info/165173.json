{"id": 165173, "slug": "box-avoider", "name": "Box Avoider", "name_original": "Box Avoider", "description": "<p>A dodging game with a twist! The boxes will bounce against everything, making it very unpredictable. Nowhere is safe!<br/><br/>Playtime: &lt;5min<br/>No sound.</p>\r\nAfterthoughts\r\n<p>Another simple game, reminiscent of the first web games. This time it's a keyboard-only game.<br/><br/>I played around with Unity's rigidbody physics in order to get some neat emergent effects in the game. The box bouncing makes for a very interesting game of trying to anticipate the bounces. Situations that look hopeless will usually have a gap or two due to how the boxes interact with each other.<br/><br/>I used rigidbodies for the player control as well, but the result wasn't as I had hoped. I wanted the player control to be more responsive and less 'acceleration' based, but I wasn't able to get the settings quite right.<br/><br/>Overall, unity's physics system is quite powerful. I'll have to study it more in order to learn how to control it better.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/266/2661d03f63dfbd11d5cdfb532c0da178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clorica6"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
