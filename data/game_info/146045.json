These circuit games will provide hundreds of hours of challenging entertainment!<br/>- A circuit jam will happen if you don't allow the power to flow out!<br/> <br/>How to play Powerhouse:<br/>Simply use your finger to slide the components into order to make a power line and connect the LED just like in an unblock puzzle. Roll the power to the finish to light all the LED's on the circuits to pass the level. Careful not to jam the circuits!<br/>Make use of the following electronics in every circuit:<br/>- Voltage source: Your journey starts with this power! Roll the power line to flow to the LED from here by sliding the tiles and connect them together and free the blocks that are stuck!<br/>- LED: This is where your journey ends. Once the power flows to all of these on the circuitry board, you will advance to the next epic unblock level!<br/>- Voltage Splitter: Need an extra power source? Just split the voltage power line to flow to the nearest blocks! Unblock me from the sides and connect!<br/>- Zener Diode: Voltage can only pass one way through these devices, so think hard where you place them.<br/>- Transistor: These require 2 power sources connected to power up - which then your transistor will turn on! Think strategically!<br/>- Once the slider circuits are connected and the current has a flow free to the end you win!<br/> <br/>Unblock puzzles are proven to help with logic making decisions and overall health of your brain. Mind games are great for kids, adults and anyone else. Enjoy these number puzzles with the whole family! Sliding puzzles can be a great pass time!<br/> <br/>Do you love to solve puzzles?
