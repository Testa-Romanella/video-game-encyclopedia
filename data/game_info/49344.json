Your objective is to drive the enemy out of your land and make your way to the enemy base and destroy it. They don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming, but neither do you!<br />\nThe game has an isometric view on the level, which stands out from the typical for this genre top-down or side view and adds some depth to the environment. The graphics are simple yet eye-catching, with lots of stuff happening on screen. There&#39;s no room for boredom.<br />\nKey features include most of what you&#39;d expect to see in an arcade shooter: a variety of enemies, power-ups, changing environments, player progression, score, etc.Planned features:<br />\nSteam Achievements<br />\nSteam Leaderboards<br />\nTrading cards</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d0/7d05036b7920dd509c5e0e69701d9c89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["TocanaDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TocanaDev"], "esrb_rating": null}
