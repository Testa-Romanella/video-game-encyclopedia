Even the <strong>big region plants</strong> struggle to find enough ressources to flourish.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abuchi</strong>, a nomad that travels through this desert\u00a0has found a<strong> region plant seedling</strong>, and wants to find a place in which it could flourish. <strong>She must find a way to revive the desert</strong> and make it a place in which life springs.</p>\n\n<p>But, in <em>INITEN</em>, life and sounds are closely related. Indeed, <strong>sound </strong>can be compared to a sort of <strong>life energy</strong>.\u00a0This specificity is going to be very useful for our character Abuchi. Our hero has a very special and unique ability : <strong>she can see sounds</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Each <strong>sound </strong>Abuchi can hear is visible as a <strong>colorful fluid shape</strong> evolving in the environment, near the source of the sounds. For <em>example</em>: imagine, a bird singing. Not only can you hear the sound, you can also see it. Those sounds can be used as a sort of special <strong>energy </strong>to <strong>revive lifeless vegetation</strong>!</p>\n\r\nThe Team\r\n\n<p>INITEN is a graduation project made by students from SUPINFOGAME RUBIKA. We worked during one year on this game project.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Team</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Vincent Jalliffier-Merlon - <em>Producer &amp; technical artist</em><br/>\u2022 Aur\u00e9lie Bouquet - <em>Concept artist &amp; 3D artist</em><br/>\u2022 C\u00e9cile Jaubert - <em>Concept artist &amp; animator</em><br/>\u2022 Yu\u00e8 Du - <em>Programmer</em><br/>\u2022 Guillaume Lucas - <em>Technical game designer</em><br/>\u2022 Isabelle Lallemand - <em>Lead game designer</em><br/>\u2022 Fran\u00e7ois Dernoncourt - <em>Game designer</em><br/>\u2022 Roman Ruiz - Game &amp; <em>level designer</em></p>\n<p><strong>External Team</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Ewan Argouse - <em>Game designer</em><br/>\u2022 Julie Jeanvoine - <em>3D artist</em><br/>\u2022 Victor De Lipski - <em>Sound designer</em><br/>\u2022 Guillaume Rivi\u00e8re - <em>Animator</em><br/>\u2022 Quek Rui Jing -<em> Programmer</em><br/>\u2022 Vincent Sergent - <em>Composer</em><br/>\u2022 Alo\u00efs Mispelon - <em>Graphics programmer</em></p>\n\r\nInformations\r\n\n<p>The game is playable<strong> ONLY with a gamepad</strong>, and we highly recommend the use of <strong>headphones </strong>for an optimal experience.
