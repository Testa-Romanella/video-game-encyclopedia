As the royal penguin you need to gather them up and lead them out of the iceberg. Slide around the slippery ice with your penguins friends and make your way quickly to the exit.</p>\n<p>How fast can you beat the 15 levels?</p>\r\nHow does the game work?\r\n<p>You control the royal penguin, caracterised by his golden hair. He can slide in any direction, but he will move until he hits a wall. When you slide over a penguin, he gets collected and stacks over the royal penguin. Now whenever you move, the final position will be further from the wall, depending on the number of penguins you have joined together. Snow tiles allow penguins to stop directly on them. Holes need to be avoided.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\nMenu\r\n<p><strong>WASD </strong>or <strong>arrow keys</strong> to move up and down.<br/><strong>Left (A) </strong>and <strong>right (D)</strong><strong> </strong>to adjust the volume levels.<br/><strong>Enter </strong>to select an option.</p>\r\nIn game\r\n<p><strong>WASD </strong>or <strong>arrow keys</strong> to slide in a direction.<br/><strong>R </strong>to restart the level.<br/><strong>Escape </strong>to access the menu.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Not compatible with mobile devices / touchscreen inputs.</strong></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All art, music and programming made specifically for the project during the 48 hours of the GMTK\u00a0 Game Jam 2021 by the 5 of us.</p>\n<p>David Taramarcaz / Terrarc (Level Design, Programming)<br/>Thomas Steinmann / superflouz (Art, Animations, Programming)<br/>Adam True / AdamAlpaca (Music, SFX, Programming)<br/>Alain Hardy (Programming)<br/>Corentin Barman / DrEchoes (Programming, Project Management).</p>\n<p>Running in Unity 3D.<br/>Font: Penguin by Francis Fonye<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:08:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7c/a7c6c6ac60884d1ad9da3536bd373e6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DrEchoes", "Terrarc", "AdamAlpaca", "superflouz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
