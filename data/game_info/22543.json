The experience is shared between every game mode. The player can earn and spend their experience points both in PvE and PvP. Thus, a player can move from one game mode to the other very easily. During a Fight, two teams face each other.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFIGHTS WORK ON A DYNAMIC TURN BASED SYSTEM:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile a player attacks, the other player defends or prepares a counter-attack. This system makes the game very dynamic. Positioning becomes a key-composant of the fights. It can change who the character is currently targeting and the might of their attacks. Special area influence the fight greatly: among other things, they allow characters to launch special abilities but can also give them bonuses or misuses. Each character has different Special Skills. These skills are powerful and unique (alteration of areas, attack with Area of Effect, heal on allies, etc.) To trigger them, the player must place their character on a Harmony or Dissonance area.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHARMONY and DISSONANCE:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA real mind game with two types of magical energy on Thasys.<br/>\r\nHarmony: actions are predictable and without any danger for the character who uses it.<br/>\r\nDissonance: effects are always stronger but dangerous and unstable for their user.<br/>\r\nEvery action can be triggered with either Harmony or Dissonance.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCREATURES AND THE CREATION OF HARMONY AREA<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCreatures are magical entities who channel the magical energy of the world of Thasys. At the end of his turn, if the Creature acts in Harmony, it creates a Harmony area.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTHE DISSONANCE HAS STRONGER EFFECTS BUT COMES WITH MANY DANGERS<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach time the player uses the Dissonance, a Dissonance area is created. On these areas, the player cannot use their abilities in Harmony. Characters are forced to use Dissonance, and then, to create a new Dissonance area. Also, each time the player uses Dissonance, there is a risk that an Explosion of Dissonance occurs. The chances an Explosion occurs increase with the number of Dissonance areas. The Explosion destroys every Dissonance areas on the player\u2019s side and deals high damages. The amount of damages depends on the number of destroyed areas.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAFFINITY DEFENSE and AFFINITY ATTACK<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach character is linked to a magic Arcana. They have an Affinity with this Arcana.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuring the Defense Sequence, the player can use Affinities to protect several characters at the same time. During the Attack Sequence, the player can also use Affinities to trigger secondary attacks at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nREINFORCEMENT<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player can add new characters during a fight. They simply have to be placed on Harmony areas during the player\u2019s turn. The Harmony areas are then destroyed.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVICTORY<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVictory conditions depend on the Game mode.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Bastion mode, The player might have to vanquish all their enemies to end the fight.<br/>\r\nIn PvP fights, the victory is determined by a Victory Point system.
