So feel free to test the game, and share your opinion on it with me here, or on twitter: @HijackOverdrive</p>\n<p>Currently most of the game has placeholder graphics, so no feedback on that desired. Except for everything you see in the video above, while that is still not necessarily the final look, it is the style I'm going for.<br/></p>\n<p>The game also currently lacks proper explanations for everything in the game (I just placed some text in various places, explaining things, but that's ofcourse not how I intend it to be in the final version).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T04:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93c/93c12d9479192e996f43ba45fe2e33fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamingStef"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
