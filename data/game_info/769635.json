Reach the end of each level and defeat the elite plane at the end to complete the level. Defeat planes to get coins in order to repair and upgrade your plane as you cross through five levels. Will you be able to cross all five levels or will you be taken down by the never-ending horde of planes?</p>\n<p>Note: This game is HARD. There is a hard mode in the game, but it is REALLY DIFFICULT. Even I've never completed it, so good luck! Here are some tips I got while playing:</p>\n<ul><li>Get the spread-shot as soon as possible. It'll save you a ton of pain.</li><li>Focus on conserving health early in the game rather than money.</li></ul>\n<p>One last thing: Use P to pause the game, not Esc.</p>\n<p>Have fun and thank you for playing!</p><p>Music by TeknoAXE:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtgf00GvfFQVsYBA7V7RwUw</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T06:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9a/b9aff7e2c4cc26dc7eac978da392cdb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boinga"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
