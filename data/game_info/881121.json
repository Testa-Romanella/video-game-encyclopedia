It's an album, not a game?\r\n<p>Well, yeah. But you download it to your Playdate like a game, and it is kind of playable... you can explore the album art with the D-pad or scroll through the lyrics with the crank as you listen.</p>\r\nSo is this... legal?\r\n<p>This album was made free, as in free speech, by the band upon release. The masters are available at https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/polygondwanaland. Anyone can publish this album, and so this is me publishing it for Playdate.</p>\n<p>This release of the album is also free as in free beer. If you like this album and want to spend some money, you should buy a copy of Nonagon Infinity, another great album by KGATLW.<br/></p>\r\nYou mentioned art?\r\n<p>Album art is included in this Playdate release. All the artwork is rendered in 1-bit graphics, and all of it is much too big to fit on the Playdate screen, so you can use the D-pad to scroll about and explore the details of artwork. Press the 'A' button to change the image.</p>\r\nSo what does the 'B' button do then?\r\n<p>'B' button presses change the operating mode:</p>\n<p>* Single click 'B' to display lyrics, crank to scroll.</p>\n<p>* Double click 'B' to adjust volume (you can of course set volume from the system menu, but that pauses the audio... grr).</p>\n<p>* Triple click 'B' for track select mode; here D-pad left and right will select the track, and the crank allows you to scrub through the audio of the current track.<br/></p>\r\nAnything else?\r\n<p>Help and About screens are available via the system menu.<br/></p>\r\nHow do I install it?\r\n<p>Sideload to your Playdate as per any other sideloaded game (instructions at https://help.play.date/games/sideloading/). It is a full album... despite the fact that the audio is compressed and the art is (obviously) rendered in 1-bit, it takes up a little over 100Mb of space, which is a lot for a Playdate game. It will take a few minutes to upload to your Playdate account, and about 15 minutes to download to your Playdate.</p>\r\nPlaydate albums are great I would like to make another one!\r\n<p>If you want to release an album for Playdate and you like the system used here, you can get it from github: https://github.com/YoursTruly2095/playdate_album<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T15:13:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bdb946b0d7d973b0e2245853ccae75e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YoursTruly2095"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
