If you sell the icecream that the customer wants you will still get the money, but you will get a strike. If you get over 3 strikes you lose.</p><p>If the customer does not want your flavour of the day, you must try to convince him otherwise. If the customer really does not want it (shown by the 3 red exclamation marks), you can choose to send him out of the shop, give him the flavours that he wants or you can threaten him. </p><p>Be careful with making your decision, it can either lead to getting a strike, losing lots of money or it can get you killed.</p><p>To get the icecream flavours you must click on 1 of the squares under \"Chosen flavours\" (it will turn orange) and then click on 1 of the colors in the shop. The flavour will appear in the square.
