As you are aware that you will be turned into stone should you look into her eyes, you will solely be able to see the enemies in the opposite direction you are facing. But be careful, Medusa's snakes patrol the cave, and they will camouflage themselves as you come close! See if you can find and defeat Medusa in her own lair!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys for movement. Space bar for aerial attack.</p>\n<p>Hint:</p>\n<p>The direction you are facing will not change in the air, so you could make small hops in the direction you want to while still pointing your vision forwards. Good luck! (I suggest turning up your brightness and going fullscreen to see clearer)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T04:57:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/479/479010ab66799b40c1222c8ababb9ff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Elporkador"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
