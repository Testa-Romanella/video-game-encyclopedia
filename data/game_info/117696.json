The untold story is that you control a skeleton king which has been banished from its dungeon by those filthy human adventurers, and must now enter the dungeon again to reclaim it. <br/><br/>At this point there are no enemies, only puzzle mechanics. The puzzles are not very difficult and are mostly designed to teach the mechanics. There are four levels in total in this prototype build. I apologize in advance for potential bugs.<br/><br/>I want to thank\u00a0Matthew Palaje and Rick Davidson from youtube on motivating me to finish this prototype as a \"first\" game that I am realizing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf431fb8c072c5f30d30b54c8330a831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Needless"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
