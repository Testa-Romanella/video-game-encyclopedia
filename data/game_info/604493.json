Unfortunately, it was not created in the required time of 3 hours, but took almost 2 days, because we are both inexperienced game developers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to your comments if you liked the little game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T05:53:51", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Painder"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
