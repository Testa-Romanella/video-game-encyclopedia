The thumb can be used to scroll the <strong>ball\u2019s horizontal position</strong> and tapping the ball would make it jump. The intensity of the tapping or basically the duration of how long the ball was tapped would determine how high the ball is to jump, though there is a maximum threshold height to which it can jump.</p>\n<p>The fun and challenging part is that the <strong>obstacles</strong> are brick walls which are\u00a0<strong>color\u00a0coded</strong>. This implies that each block of wall has a different color and each color represents different height. If a player only taps on the ball once and tries to jump over a while wall they would succeed because it is the lowest wall, however the black wall has the height value so they have to time it. The array of walls make it confusing since we are trying to<strong> co-relate colors\u00a0with depth</strong>. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T10:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc5/fc5bfd70ac76b6b24918bde9bdb6c745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PercyX"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
