Your goal is to keep the R rate below 1.\u00a0Good luck!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Covid Express is a\u00a0game set on a busy London Underground train. The\u00a0user\u00a0plays as \u2018Hasmat', a character who is tasked with ensuring social distancing guidelines are adhered to.\u00a0This is done by\u00a0either physically grabbing and moving\u00a0passengers further apart,\u00a0\u00a0or by giving them a face mask. Each iteration is completely random, meaning the number of passengers and seat choice changes every time the game is played.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve built it using a combination of the\u00a0scripts provided by LabX and my own scripts, and used real life data. It's a\u00a0lighthearted game, built from scratch\u00a0using Unity, Maya and ZBrush.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have built this game on my own as part of the \"Jamming the Curve\" game jam. It's still a work in progress and I will\u00a0continue to add more features - if you have any feedback or\u00a0suggestions\u00a0I would love to hear them!\u00a0Thanks and enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T06:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/548577d57d44eeb6704398ffc78b79ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Feelingterrible"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
