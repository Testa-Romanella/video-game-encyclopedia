Game doesn't have graphics , sound , music and I'm gonna add a lot of gameplay aspects if I get positive feedback. The game is a mobile casual platformer game. Don't forget to leave your feedback. So I can understand if its a good game design or a bad one because I can't see the quality of my own products. Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T04:40:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a02/a028bb2bc14b232fc41ff3db74e6a720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gypsy1714"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
