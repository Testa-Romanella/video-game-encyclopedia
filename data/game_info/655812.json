A beginner in developing games!\u00a0I have created a game called \"Chaotic Beans\". By the title, you can tell that this game has beans and is chaotic!\r\n<p>This game was created for the\u00a0Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2</p>\n<p>You have fight through waves of enemies on each level, there are 5 levels in total. I will be adding more levels and updates to the game. On Level 5, you have to defeat the boss who is called \"<strong>Big\u00a0Bean Boss.</strong>\" He looking kind of THICC. He also has 2 lightsabers that are green and do a lot of damage so be careful!</p>\n<p><strong>The enemies include 3 stages.</strong></p>\n<p>1. <strong>Red Beans</strong></p>\n<p>These beans are red with red lightsabers, and do not that much damage. Be careful though, because if you don't dodge their attacks they will do more damage then usual.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.<strong> Blue Beans.</strong></p>\n<p>These beans are blue with a special kind of weapon.\u00a0The weapon is called \"The Bonk Hammer\" and is used to <strong>BONK</strong> the player on the head. I\u00a0will be adding a bonk animation to this game very soon. They do a decent amount of damage so watch out!\u00a0That bonk hammer is pretty strong.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Green\u00a0Beans</strong></p>\n<p>These beans are green, with nothing but their fist. They wont have a weapon until a future update but there really strong. You know how there is \"<strong>One Punch Man</strong>?\" Well these beans can definitely punch almost as strong as him. These are the strongest beans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These are all the enemies! I hope you enjoy this game, also there is a decent amount of parkour! Let me know if you want more updates on this game, it could be improved.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music/sound effects created by Russet or RussetVibes.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:25:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d44/d44d3d66860e6e50582e92f393ac732e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FreshiGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
