For each scene, you are given a \"score\" based on how much damage the character has taken. The controls are simple: tilt the device to slightly alter gravity, guiding the character into objects -- swipe a finger on the screen to \"nudge\" the character -- or touch on-screen interactive props such as pinball flippers, cannons, rockets, cars, and more to cause even more damage!<br/><br/><br/>--==--==--==--==--<br/>Lite Version Features:<br/><br/>* Amazing Ragdoll physics<br/><br/>* 5 scenes to try out, plus 3 special scenes created by Ouch! players<br/><br/>* Download player-created scenes right from within the game (Lite version is limited to storing only 1 downloaded scene at a time)<br/><br/>* 10 built-in game replays showing gameplay from the full version.<br/><br/>* Full replay system - watch playback in forward, reverse, slow motion, fast motion and any speed in-between with the intuitive \"playback spinner\"<br/><br/>* Unique \"High Impact Tour\" of the full version.<br/><br/>* Detailed how-to-play instructions<br/><br/><br/>--==--==--==--==--<br/>The Full Game Features:<br/><br/>* Over 40 pre-built scenes to play<br/><br/>* Over 60 props and objects to interact with (crash into, hit, drop, shoot, etc)<br/><br/>* Create your own characters with customizable outfits, hats and hairstyles, and faces<br/><br/>* Put your friends (or your enemies, or your own!) face on a character by importing pictures from your photo library, or by taking pictures directly with the iPhone camera - complete with multiple facial expressions!
