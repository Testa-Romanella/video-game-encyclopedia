{"id": 979466, "slug": "mushrush-2", "name": "Mushrush", "name_original": "Mushrush", "description": "In this platformer you play as a lonesome mushroom creature in search of some fungal friends.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTraverse through increasingly difficult levels to approach and befriend the different mushrooms waiting at the end. Run, jump, slide, and crouch your way through mountains, caves, lakes and floating islands to increase your circle of friends. And, of course, perform a celebratory dance with your new friends. When you have found and befriended all seven fungal friends, you will all grow together under a great pine tree and live happily ever after. (Until you are stepped on, eaten, kicked or wither away!)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe flowers all have different uses such as a speed boost and a launch pad so make sure to utilize these as you traverse Mushrush. Jump and run carefully while you make your way over lily pads, rocks, trees and other obstacles to prevent a a devastating death, respawning you back at the start of the level you're on. Or don't! Also, don't worry if you have to take a break before you collect all 7 friends because the level you're on will save.
