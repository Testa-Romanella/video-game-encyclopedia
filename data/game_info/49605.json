Everywhere she goes it rains \u2013 is she going to ruin everyone\u2019s day?<br/>\r\nRain or Shine is Nexus\u2019 interactive 360\u00b0 mobile VR short film made for Google Spotlight Stories. Directed by Felix Massie, Rain or Shine follows Ella, a charismatic young girl who loves being outside in the sunshine, but whenever she puts her sunglasses on all loveliness disappears \u2013 her very own raincloud appears above her head and showers her with unwanted rain.
