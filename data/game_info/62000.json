{"id": 62000, "slug": "flock-of-dogs", "name": "Flock of Dogs", "name_original": "Flock of Dogs", "description": "<strong>FLOCK OF DOGS</strong> is a wild 1- to 8-player couch co-op adventure. Mount your winged dog to join the flying crew of dog riders. Then with your brother and sister dog riders, navigate treacherous and wonderous skies, solve environmental puzzles, and engage in high flying twin stick shooter battles. Soar through the air, wield harpoons, carry solar panels, fire cannonballs, pick apples, mop dirt, read maps, take naps, and make life long friends with a flying whale. Together, go on a road trip through the sky with handmade and procedurally generated levels. Discover secrets, defeat enemies, and achieve the great symbiosis of dog, whale, and rider!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>UP TO EIGHT PLAYER LOCAL CO-OP</strong><br/>2 to 8 players (or 1 player with a magic whale whistle) need to work together to guide the flock. Many weapons and tools require teammwork, such as the hose + mop, the triplicator shield, and the electric clothesliner. Progression is largely linked to the dogs and the sky whale, allowing individual players to drop in/drop out at any time.<br/><br/><strong>TEND TO YOUR FLOCK</strong><br/>Care for your feathered canines by providing food and water, and teaching them new tricks such as rollover, bite, and play dead. Raise the next generation of puppies to ensure the survival of the flock.<br/><br/><strong>ATTACH EQUIPMENT TO YOUR WHALE</strong><br/>Stash items and resources in the belly of the whale. Visit the whalesmith to buy whale attachments such as a horn drill, spot light, solar shield system, and anchor.<br/><br/><strong>DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS AND CHALLENGE</strong><br/>Many paths lay before the flock and decisions along the journey will affect the story's end. Daring teams of clever dog riders can choose routes with devious monsters and puzzling mysteries. While others may choose leisurely routes with comfy sky inns, (mostly) friendly flying creatures, and brightly lit sky canyons.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7c385155e1b53ac252030ccb80280a9.jpg", "website": "https://www.flockofdogs.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Max Clark"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Max Clark"], "esrb_rating": null}
