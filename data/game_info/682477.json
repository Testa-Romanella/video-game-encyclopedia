{"id": 682477, "slug": "space-funeral-3d", "name": "Space Funeral 3D", "name_original": "Space Funeral 3D", "description": "<p>Space Funeral 3D was created by a dedicated team of unpaid volunteers  over a timespan of about half a year (with most of that time taken up  by the map file just lying around and accumulating dust). Someone  accidentally dug up the project just in time for the deadline of Kate's  Informal Katelabs Jam (https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/12033), so now you have to suffer through this mess. Play it or perish!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thanks to Kate for creating such a fun game/tool! Thank you to the  BBC Radiophonic Workshop for preemptively composing the soundtrack for  Space Funeral 3D half a century ago. Thank you to thecatamites for  inspiring the original character of Hand Horse\u2122. Thank you to all Space  Funeral fangame makers, especially all those that never published their  work anywhere and just left their beautifully unfinished RPG Maker  projects germinating in some subfolder. Also thank you to Nintendo for  providing the Mario\u2122 license to Camelot Software Planning - where would  we be without them?\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:37:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/abaf025612eb1c732ec991ac3c6eca31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spiders", "krisekrise"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
