Can you make it home alive? What dangers lie in wait in the early hours of the night?</strong></p>\n<p>Late Night Wanderer tries to capture the feeling of paranoia and fear by taking the player through dark and empty streets that are a bitter contrast to the warm and inviting home you are trying to reach. Just a late night walk through the city in the early hours of the morning, what lurks down the dark alleys and lonely roads at night?<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Darryl Long - Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Nick Duxbury -\u00a0 Lead Designer</p>\n<p>Tristan Shaw -\u00a0 Designer</p>\n\n<p>Music - CheukNam Wong</p>\n<p>Audio - Brendan Blanch, Natalie Salmon-Plesia,\u00a0Kiara Martinovic-Kellerman</p>\n<p>Freesounds - InspactorJ, Polytest, duckduckpony, luckylittleraven, janbezouska, samulis, dobroide, snapper4298, tigersound, blimp66, SoundsExciting, deleted_user_37, Rudmer_Rotteveel, SpaceJoe, Mickael_Leroi, M-RED, vibe_crc, albertofrog, morganpurkis</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb8/bb88f366974d045b2c9400f8dd0eaa13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tristan Shaw", "Nicholas Duxbury", "LarrylDong"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
