{"id": 501241, "slug": "descension-arkytoothis", "name": "Descension (Arkytoothis)", "name_original": "Descension (Arkytoothis)", "description": "<p>Descension is a First Person Party Based RPG inspired by games like Might and Magic and D&amp;D but with grid-less movement and procedural world generation. Features turn-based combat, crafting, party morale and injury/trauma system (like Darkest Dungeon). Low poly, vibrant art style.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My goal is to create a fun RPG with lots of atmosphere, exploration, some survival elements, procedurally generated islands (5 biomes planned, mountain/forest, snow, desert, jungle/tropical and volcanic/waste) and multi level dungeons.<br/></p>\n<p>I am a single, not very artistic developer. I prefer to spend my time building game systems and not creating art. Most of the game assets used were bought from the Unity asset store. \u00a0I have spent a fair amount of time finding assets that fit well together. All of the 3d models used are from the same team of creators (Synty Studios) so they share the same artistic look. Visual and audio effects also fit together well though there are some placeholder assets used.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Very Early Alpha.<br/></p>\n<p>Regular development updates planned. I may do dev videos depending upon interest.<br/></p>\n<p>Steam Early Access and release planned. (no release date yet).</p>\n<p>Scenes in screenshots are test scenes only and will be updated soon to show how actual in game levels will appear. \u00a0Current scenes are used to test lighting and movement/interaction.</p>\n\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p>Backspace will exit the game (except new game screen)<br/></p>\n<p>New Game Screen - You start with 4 Character. The next and previous buttons will select the next/previous character. The Random button will randomly change the Characters race and looks, profession is currently locked. The race dropdown menu does nothing yet.<br/></p>\n<p>Continue and Load buttons both skip character generation and loads the last party</p>\n<p>Options button does nothing.<br/></p>\n<p>Test Island <br/></p>\n<p>W,A,S,D controls</p>\n<p>Left Alt - toggles Mouse Look. Cursor is wonky and you have to click on window to refocus game.</p>\n<p>C - Opens Character Viewer - not much functionality yet.</p>\n<p>Encounter</p>\n<p>Tab - skips current actor, no other functionality implemented currently</p>\n<p>End Encounter simply destroys all enemies and returns party to Exploration state</p>\n\n<p>ISSUES</p>\n<p>Too many to list. Nothing really works except for scene transitions, saving data, basic inventory and combat. If something seems broken it probably just isn't implemented yet, but feel free to leave feedback anyway.<br/></p>\n<p>I am interested mostly in crash reports and and major graphical glitches (pink or white textures/models especially). Also any issues with really low frame rate (no in game frame counter yet).</p>\n<p>Load times between scenes should be really quick (5 seconds or so) depending on hardware.</p>\n<p>Currently no way to access the Test Dungeon from Test Island, next build will include some dungeon entrances.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:27:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0a/a0a14f5ff31b2433bb106c61e3dd7a4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arkytoothis"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
