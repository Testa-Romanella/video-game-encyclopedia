{"id": 514640, "slug": "plasma-mania", "name": "Plasma Mania", "name_original": "Plasma Mania", "description": "<p>Plasma Mania is a game about a space station attempting to protect the Earth from a massive influx of asteroids. Destroy asteroids, use bombs, send down recovery packs to Earth and just try to survive.</p>\n<p><strong>THIS GAME REQUIRES A GYROSCOPE TO PLAY ON ANDROID OR IOS</strong>. To play simply hold your device out in front of you, and prepare to aim it in any direction (VR-style). Asteroids can come from anywhere, so be quick and be aware of your surroundings!</p><p>Updates will be coming to include the ability to launch a Shield Satellite to protect an area, the iOS version, more game modes and leader boards.</p><p>Resurrected for the Revival Jam!</p><p>See some screenshots of older versions that were heading in a very different direction!</p>Original Title Background:<br/><p>Prototype that was basically seeing how many asteroids you could beat in each wave.</p><p>This is backfrom when I had plans for the game to be much longer, with you continuously trying to keep preserve the population and economy of the planet. Instead of an Earth health bar there is a Space Station shield bar - an idea that has received many revamps along the way. There were also plans to collect colored crystals to help stimulate the regrowth of the planet.</p><br/><p>The current game is built off of an older build from around the time of this screenshot, which was before I went on a huge tangent to try to turn it into a 360 degree \"Satellite Defense\" game (Aka the worst Tower Defense you've ever played). That branch had its version control become wildly corrupted.<br/></p><p>This is from the Satellite Defense Idea. The plan was to have completely modular satellites that you launch from the Space Station that could serve different purposes. You would have to have the blueprints ready before each round.<br/></p>I may have then proceeded to waste a month or two trying to redesign the cockpit.<p>And another month trying to make a stupidly impossible \"cool looking\" space station that LITERALLY SITS BEHIND THE CAMERA THE ENTIRE TIME. You only ever saw it in the \"Rearview Mirror\" Camera.</p><p>After losing almost all of that Satellite/Space Station/Cockpit jazz this is what we end up with today.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T08:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07ac987b576d43ad7b800df776ae0f06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Twisted Webbe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
