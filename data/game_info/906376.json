She stopped her years of suffering from lung cancer in peace, after the first few hours of 2023, before the dawn.</p>\n<p>In her last years, she always complained about not hearing clearly, and rested a lot on the bed. I thought it must because she was busy saving the world at somewhere beyond, making her tired, and often too far away to hear the voice from this world.

She planted so many beautiful things in her life, and here came the harvest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T09:18:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/575/575d66ca8238e3d4451351878793d077.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["S.
