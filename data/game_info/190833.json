Levels are planned to be streamlined into handcrafted maze-like areas that each possess their own unique theme and purpose in Helmarch's grim fiction. Players will progress with a skill system and develop their own weapon arsenal that allows them to interact with the world and progress further in the story through several facilities and spaces.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b78c77ad4aad0f645ac6520f936571aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Radvantage"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
