Can you find all 15 treasures chests hidden all over the island?\r\n </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game is an early prototype. You can download a demo for Linux, Windows, and Android below. By now, it is still rather short but I will continue to add new content and to build the whole island.\r\n </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it anyways.  If you have any feedback, I would really appreciate if you leave a comment.\r\n </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!\r\n </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\r\n </strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>On PC:</em>\n</p>\n<p>This game is intended to be played with a gamepad. I have tested it with a wired xbox 360 controller but others should work as well. It also works with keyboard.\r\n </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>w a s d = move around\r\n </p>\n<p>k = First/main action\r\n </p>\n<p>h = Second action\r\n </p>\n<p>i = Inventory/pause\r\n </p>\n<p>c = Show controls in-game at any time\r\n </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>On Android:\r\n </em></p>\n<p>Controls will be displayed on app start. Left half of the screen is for movement (swipe and hold) and the right half is divided in subsections for first action, second action, and inventory.\r\n </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Some additional notes:\r\n </strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>- There is currently no real load/save implemented. You don't lose progress if you die, but if you close the application, you have to start again from the beginning. Since the game is still short, you should be able to beat it in one session (my \"speedrun\" took about 15 minutes).\r\n </p>\n<p>- All coding, art, and sound arrangements are done by me in my spare time (one song is composed by my brother). Inspiration are mainly (but not exclusively) the GB(C) games Link's Awakening and Oracle of Seasons/Ages.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T15:53:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/0237eb80e1e505f67bd6bab3ddd7ada6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["stedu"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
