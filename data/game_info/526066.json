{"id": 526066, "slug": "winter-bliss", "name": "Winter Bliss", "name_original": "Winter Bliss", "description": "<p>This is my first video game. I wanted to make something chill that tried to replicate the meditative-like experience of cross-country skiing. It's not about speed, excitement, competition, or optimisation. Just about relaxing and enjoying the repeating motions.</p>\n<p>My goal was to make the game in 3D but everyone recommends that you start with 2D, so I made this Out Run-like, fake-3D version as a proof of concept.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: The tutorial shows the keyboard controls but you can also play with a controller. The \"pole\" controls (W, O) would be the shoulder buttons (ie. L1 and R1 on a PlayStation controller) and the \"ski\" controls (Q, P) would be the triggers (ie. L2 and R2 on a PlayStation controller).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T05:25:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/6563ea7d0881630e8e66cd3cbf4062ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hardcore Narrativist"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
