The babies and the mother depend on each other to survive the attacks of the hostile cells.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In order for the cell babies to stay alive, they must stay inside the mother's body that acts as an incubator. If they stay outside for too long, they perish. The mother needs her babies to protect herself from the hostile cells. She can eliminate the enemies by throwing her babies at them. However, once the babies are thrown, the mother must pick them back up before they're exposed to the outside world! Long story short, the mother and the babies are joined together for the sake of survival.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to stay alive as long as possible while trying to lose as few babies as you can!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:18:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/476/476cea83e9f205cf7b310caa643b33c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueBee Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
