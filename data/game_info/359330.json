Train your custom Madness combatant for the endless trials of Arena Mode, building weapons from your own sick imagination to get through just one more wave of deranged assailants. Or, play through the core campaign as the antiheroes of the Madness universe and unearth the terrible secrets of Project Nexus itself.<br />\nMADNESS: Project Nexus challenges your use of immersive &amp; tactical combat, on-your-feet decision making, environmental navigation, a massive selection of weapons, and a pretty heavy dose of comic blood and violence. You&#39;ll progress through the game by navigating between rooms and overworld stages, engaging baddies along the way (who become wiser and more tactical as you advance). Not everyone is cut out to survive; we think you may be the exception.<br />\nCan you overcome the hordes of gun-toting Agents, sword-brandishing assassins, and bullet-deflecting giants that Project Nexus throws in your path? Grab your trusty weapon and let&#39;s find out.<br />\nMADNESS: Project Nexus features:<br />\nStory Campaign: Take the reigns of the heroes of the Madness universe, and infiltrate heavily guarded installations, survive cultist-ridden tunnel networks, fight back against dynamite-wielding cannibal bandits, and dodge the grasp of armor-plated Mag Agents over three times your size.<br />\nArena Mode: Create your character from scratch, advance through specialized skill tiers, and build a unique Madness warrior who is equipped to take on wave after wave of never-ending badguys in several combat environments. Build your own custom weapons and outfit them with the latest technology to give yourself the edge you&#39;re going to need to pull through.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-04T21:38:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e8e/e8e58baea875da094c52389286a701a9.jpg", "website": "http://www.madnessprojectnexus.com", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 64, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 3, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 332, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GIBBING TREE"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GIBBING TREE"], "esrb_rating": null}
