Monsters of Th</em><em>e Dead have arisen after Halloween and are attacking the ancient cities of Wizworld. The Dead have already taken the capital of Brasswhole, but an important artifact that may change the course of the war still remains inside the city walls: the crystal key. You, a one-man army Commando Wizlord have been sent to safely acquire this weapon from the heart of the monster-ridden city. You know some beneficial spellbooks that can be acquired on your way to the center that may help you fight the hoard, but it will not be easy\u2026\u00a0</em><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>NOTE: This game has no sound or title screen.
