It was revived and revised in 2015 after discovering that DOS executables could be run in the browser with em-dosbox.  To select an option, press the key as indicated by the highlight, or click on it with the mouse. If you have trouble with keyboard or mouse input in the browser, try fullscreen mode.</p><p>\r\n\tAlthough it's more of a toy than a game, a game mode has been added called \"Floaty Fish\" which was inspired, of course, by \"Crossy Road\".</p><p>Additions to v1.1:</p><ul>\n<li>Ported from Windows Console to DOS for em-dosbox compatibility.</li>\n<li>New display modes: Anti-gravity and Winter (with Tree and Present decor).</li>\n<li>New decorations: Gravel, Rock, Sign, Thermometer, Moving Plants.</li>\n<li>New torment mode: Kitty.</li>\n<li>New play mode: Floaty Fish.</li>\n<li>Boss key. (Ctrl-B)</li>\n<li>New dialogue.</li>\n</ul><p>It was a lot of fun coming up with little touches and funny things to add.  I hope it amuses you as much as it amused me.<br/></p><p>If the browser emulation doesn't work or is slow, you can try downloading the executable for a faster version. (I'll try to build for other OSes in the future)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54a/54ac666ac0bb302687846af18da64cf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Snowybit Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
