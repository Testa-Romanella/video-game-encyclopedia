Players can play with friends from either platform as a co-op multiplayer group.  <br/>\r\nIn the world of Skyscape, autonomous drone jets have turned on the very people who unleashed them, now the survivors must take to the sky in the old manually piloted fleet in an attempt to take on the overwhelming tide of the A.I<br/>\r\nUnlike most flight experiences, in Skyscape you are free to exit the cockpit and run free. Outside the cockpit you can organize your hardpoint mounted weapons, refuel, reload and repair. <br/>\r\nSuccessfully reaching and landing at outpost airfields enables you to collect new upgrades for your fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe jet cockpit includes fairly in-depth systems and lots of buttons and switches to interact with using unique physicalized VR interaction<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game world of Project:Skyscape is a spherical planet, meaning that it's possible to fly along the surface for as long as you care! The world is all 'in scale', meaning that it's possible to walk on the very same terrain you fly over.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRoyalty Free music in trailer: <br/>\r\nGhostrifter Official - Resurgence,<br/>\r\nAnders (Soundcloud),", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T03:41:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ed/6ed4e02713e909cb8cd97d724ccf2b22.jpg", "website": "http://www.flyleap.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flyleap Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flyleap Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
