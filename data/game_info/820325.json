I know I could have put some limitations on the dice rolls, but in the begging I thought that a level design could make things more fun and random, and it does (I think) but the game must be too easy to be playable.</p>\n<p>I hope you like the idea of this game... I definitely will use aspects of this game in a future game, but giving more control to the player, like, making the player colect the dices and using than to use the multiverse travel, something like that...</p>\n<p><strong>BROWSER NOTES:</strong>\u00a0Maybe the performance on the browser version is worse than the downloadable versions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>-------------SOFTWARES USED-----------</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Engine: Unity\r\n</p>\n<p>Coding: Visual Studio (C#)\r\n</p>\n<p>Art: Procreate, Photoshop\r\n</p>\n<p>Music: Garage Band for Mac (using apple loops)\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: I reused some effects of the game Censer Eminence in this game\r\n</p>\n<p>Font: Iloopfont (made by me for the game Iloopnati\u00a0)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T00:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/906/9061df787ad206318fb973e55205488c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bruno Gat Car"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
