First, the herons grow when you feed them fish. Also, the player character grows in abilities as they explore the island and catch bugs and get new items. Also, the player character literally grows three times as big when they collect enough mushrooms. Also, I grew as a developer while making this game over a week! Finally, my level of stress grew trying to cram all the features into this game in such a short amount of time.
