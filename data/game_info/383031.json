The theme was Dimension Switch where we had to take a mechanic from a 2D game and turn it into a 3D game or vice versa. I took the \"hit and enemy to refresh your jump\" mechanic from The Messenger and turned it into a Doom-like platform shooter. Shooting green objects (other than projectiles) refreshes your jump. Getting hit by an enemy will disable your gun for a couple seconds. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c1/7c1bab2e1881ffa13fd660eefdb9c9ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Ray"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
