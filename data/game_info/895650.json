And here we are! My newest title: FLYTRAP!</p>\n<p>This is another simplistic game. See a fly coming? Move the head of Marty the Flytrap to block its path! If a fly gets through, they'll munch on Marty's stem! Get bit a total of 4 times and you're out! It's a gourmet race!</p>\n<p><strong><em>PLAYING FLYTRAP - THE BASICS</em></strong></p>\r\nKeyboardControllerStart GameZAMoveArrow KeysD-Pad/Joystick\r\n<p>As always, this game plays best with a controller. But it still works with a keyboard, and even a little bit on phones/with a mouse! Feel free to try it however you like!</p><p>As you can probably tell, the score display doesn't work if you play in browser. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I KEEP SAYING IT'S BRUTALLY DIFFICULT TO DO A SCORE DISPLAY IN RPG MAKER!? It does work if you download the game though. Apologies for that.</p>\n<p><strong><em>JUST AS A HEADS UP</em></strong></p>\n<p>THIS GAME DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF HIGH SCORES AFTER HOW BRUTAL IT WAS TO GET THAT WORKING IN DAROACH!! BE SURE TO SCREENSHOT YOUR SCORE BEFORE STARTING A NEW GAME!</p>\n<p><strong><em>PHONE VERSION ISSUES</em></strong></p>\n<p>Sadly the phone version does have a lot of limitations? I for some reason cannot get it to play the sounds as well as the score failing to display? Plus it's a little intense about where you have to tap the screen to get the flytrap to move. Generally try tapping off the fake screen in game in the direction you want to move.\u00a0(if you're having trouble making it move down, try hitting below the screen in the center) Similarly, try tapping all around the screen in order to get the game to start, idk why that's not working either.<br/></p>\n<p>And that's about it. This is a very small game so there's not a lot to say about it. Just play for a bit and have a good time!</p>\n<p>Special shout out to Garden Guardian, a really cute little G&amp;W inspired game ALSO about fighting bugs... just in a very different way. I played it recently and it inspired me to try making a G&amp;W styled game too</p>\n<p><strong><em>PLUGINS USED</em></strong></p>\n<p>REMOVETITLESCREEN, SUPERTOOLSENGINE, AND HUDMAKER PLUGINS ALL CREATED BY SUMRNDMDDE</p>\n<p>Please check out their website, you wouldn't believe how hard it was to find a plugin that let me have a visible score display during gameplay! They saved my life on this one!</p>\n\n<p>And as always, please consider donating to my Ko-Fi if you enjoy my work! I make all my money through commissions and such, so every little bit helps. If you donate, please leave a sketch request and I'll try to draw it for you if it doesn't make me uncomfortable!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T15:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbe/dbee1ac36b50460545fa0679af828e32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bahamutgreen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
