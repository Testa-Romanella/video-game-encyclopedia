If you have\u00a0 a second monitor that goes at a lower speed you can drag the window over, or if you lower your refresh rate to 60 or 59 hz it will fix the bug.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T08:51:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2cdca98c7b1ec9a10abb99069225d39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zetim", "Ikey234"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
