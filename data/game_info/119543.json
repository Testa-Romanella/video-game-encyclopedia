Do you make new safety laws? Do you lock yourself in your room and get horribly depressed? Do you start worshipping some fat, bearded cloud god?</p><p>NO! Of course you don't! You go on a journey instead! A journey to get your island to drop down again somehow. There's always a way! And it's worth going even if you're just a little short-tempered kitty-kitten. No weird nerds or ancient kitty civilizations will stand in your way! GO YOU LITTLE FUZZBALL! KICK SOME BUTT!</p><p>Turns out actually drawing levels per hand is hard! It sorta works but the backgrounds could've used more work. Anyway! This game has a great soundtrack by Sean Cameron aka Rudy Fox again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aea/aea5860f5fa0fefafa51df80e4e90285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["origamihero"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
