It was my first published video game.&gt;</em><br/></p>\n<p>RGBeacon is a keyboard-breaking-ly difficult game about a little cuboid virus. The game is a Lunar Lander inspired platformer with a difficulty curve steeper than Tower of Heaven, but with the consistency of Super Mario Bros. In other words, It's hard, but it tries to stay true to its rules. It includes forty-eight challenging levels, one easy level, and one boss level that might also be considered challenging.<br/></p>\n<p>You guide a cube/virus that must fly through various danger filled mazes, called servers, to destroy the RGBeacons, core like squares that distribute color to the digital worlds and function as the brains of the internet. Through the adventure you challenge \"Dev\", the developer and mastermind who created the virus and the servers and traps within each domain.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Features:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>50 challenging levels\r\n</li><li>5 unique worlds\r\n</li><li>Co-op multiplayer\r\n</li><li>Two player battle mode\r\n</li><li>Keyboard support (Player one only)\r\n</li><li>Xbox One controller support (Recommended)\r\n</li><li>Any other Xinput controller (Not guaranteed to work as intended)\r\n</li><li>Soundtrack by Waterflame (https://www.youtube.com/user/waterflame89)\r\n</li><li><strong>BONUS FEATURE:</strong>\u00a0Doesn't delete system32!...

If you'd really like to play my game, but don't have Windows, my suggestion would be to use a program such as WINE (known as WINE Is Not an Emulator). I cannot guarantee expected functionality with the program, but it's worth a shot.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T06:52:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/038/0385cb606e2cdbe0f62670a24663acd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gravityhamster"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
