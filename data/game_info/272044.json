I'm the only developer and have been using most of my spare time to work on this project.</p>\n<p>The basic concept of the game is that it's a first-person tower defence, set in medieval times. You must defend the king from incoming attackers, such as spearmen, archers and knights. Make sure you don't fall in the lava too. At the moment there's only one tower (I want to have at least 3). You can upgrade the tower with weapons, like arrows, a musket or hot oil. There are also fire rate and damage upgrades. Your player can also shoot arrows. Just click and hold to pull back, then release the mouse to let go.</p><p>Controls are:</p><p>WASD - move around.</p><p>Space - jump.</p><p>Shift - Run.</p><p>LMB - fire arrow by holding and releasing. The longer you hold, the further it will go.</p><p>LMB click on tower - will bring up the upgrades menu (I'm thinking of changing this to something else).</p><p>E - exit upgrades menu.</p><p>ESC - pause menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daf/daf5971447a0a7c23aa40c73e7660a24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Camb0"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
