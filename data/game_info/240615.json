There's no basic way to interact, it's a pure simulation.<br/></p><p>However, this project is moddable. Four mods are included by default, and each one can be toggled on or off in combination with any of the others. Press keys 1-4 to toggle a mod on or off and reset the simulation.<br/></p><p>1. <strong>Dragon</strong>: replace bees with dragons and flowers with livestock. Replace \"Honey\" score with \"Meat\" score. Purely a cosmetic change.\r\n</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Double Stuff</strong>: twice as many bees and twice as many flowers.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Fast Flowers: </strong>flowers regenerate pollen four times faster.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Smart Bees: </strong>bees will seek the closest flower with the most pollen rather than seeking flowers at random.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ade/adec1794b2fe38f45abee118f592b147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["leveluplabs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
