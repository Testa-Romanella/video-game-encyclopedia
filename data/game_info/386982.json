{"id": 386982, "slug": "the-lover-of-me", "name": "The Lover of Me", "name_original": "The Lover of Me", "description": "<p>After a particularly boring day at home, you and your close friend start to discuss the recent happenings and sightings of cryptids. All of this happening in a small town known as Easton. That night, you cannot sleep and instead opt to research myths and legends around your town. You come across an old fable that speaks about the existence of three Gods, though mysteriously, the book has been damaged beyond repair save for a few images of a single God.<br/></p>\n<p>With little care for your safety, and against your mute friend's warnings, you choose to go and check out this supposed ghost town, only to come face to face with a terrifying realization: it is as if this place was never a town to begin with. There are creepy eyes that watch your every move, limbering figures, and scratchy chuckles scattered throughout the town, no doubt keeping a close eye on you!\u00a0</p>\n<p>After some more exploration, you stumble into an organic cave of some kind and end up seeing one of the legends you read about-- the only God of your world... Zielo.<br/>This God of everything sees you as a toy, something to get amusement out of. Yet... you feel like there is something more to him. Something deep down that he refuses to show.\u00a0<br/>Will you try to get through to him and see what's under that shell of his?<br/></p>\n<p>Oh, and one last thing...</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Zielo cave.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>\n<ul><li>PATREON</li><li>DEVIANTART</li><li>DISCORD</li><li>YOUTUBE</li><li>TWITTER</li></ul>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>LEAD DIRECTORS</strong><br/>Honey: https://www.instagram.com/the_h_mun/?...<br/>Jaime: https://twitter.com/BleuJais<br/>Gigi D: https://twitter.com/GigiDutreix</p>\n<p><strong>WRITERS and EDITORS</strong><br/>Topaz: https://twitter.com/Oddeyesyuya<br/>Cyril: https://twitter.com/Cael_Kitsune<br/>Melissa-S23: https://www.deviantart.com/melissa-s23<br/>Sammy: https://www.deviantart.com/spacefunclubs<br/>Darkside: https://www.deviantart.com/0enterthed...<br/>FantasyVader: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCELj...<br/>Jaime: https://twitter.com/BleuJais<br/>Honey: https://www.instagram.com/the_h_mun/?...<br/>Gigi D: https://twitter.com/GigiDutreix<br/>Disco: https://discord.gg/xW766DW</p>\n<p><strong>ARTISTS</strong><br/>Lalleol: https://twitter.com/itsalessandra__<br/>Smudgedpasta: https://www.deviantart.com/smudgedpasta<br/>RoseStorm6: https://rosestorm6.tumblr.com/<br/>CupidSonic: https://twitter.com/CupidSonic<br/>Doggo: https://twitter.com/TheWolfu<br/>Honey: https://www.instagram.com/the_h_mun/?...<br/>Gigi D: https://twitter.com/GigiDutreix<br/>Melissa-S23: https://www.deviantart.com/melissa-s23</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:47:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64d46a438b6d4633a514bb3bc7f93ccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BleuJai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
