Im making another sci-fi game. it will have multiple types of game play, but mostly shooting aliens.\u00a0</p><p>The first bit of development is ready for your consideration . Just download the 'INVADERSgamev2.3_2017.7z' file.\r\n  </p>\n<p>press ctrl+shift+f9 \u00a0to configure controls. this early level build is best played with a controller with analogue sticks. I usually use left analogue for walking and strafe , and right anaolgue for looking around and R1 for shooting. its also best to use directional arrow buttons for squad commands and the rest is up to you.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>theres no actual mission at \u00a0this early stage of development. Just give it a run and post feedback if you feel something is out of place.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I'm building this game on the same system that I built Caged Photon with. So if you got 25 fps and above in Caged Photon , you should be able to get a decent +30 fps with Invaders . My most recent benchmark of Invaders generated +- 25 fps to 45 fps , running on my Nvidia 9500 gt\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/6677db95802e093708b1b3316440b30a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nkululeko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
