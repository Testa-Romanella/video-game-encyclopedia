I like how it came out and I hope you too. It's just a little idea that i've gotten trying to make a game at a 3h game jam, \"bean jam\", but when a prototype was ready, my project crash while building it and I didn't have time to remake it. Even so I didn't let the project stay unfinished and I made some improvements and now here we are. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>- Coming soon on Android -\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T00:10:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea6/ea631e46528460d8f5bdc22842053f8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["irchit_Dev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
