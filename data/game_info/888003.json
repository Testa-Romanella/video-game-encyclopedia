The theme this year was Cliche, and my game is inspired by the \"crazy cat lady\" cliche.</p>\n<p>In KittInn, you play as Bea, a woman who discovers a mysterious cat in her house who convinces her to open a hotel for cats in her spare room. Decorate your hotel, welcome guests, and make money in this cozy management sim. You can even pet the cats!</p>\n<p>I'm considering continuing to work on this game and add mechanics such as quests, cooking treats, and exploring the town Bea lives in, so I'd love it if you could leave some feedback on KittInn and let me know if you'd like to play a full version of the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T07:58:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daa/daa92c9526e4108978fd53aec73231ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shimmerscale"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
