That said, it's incomplete...</p>\n<p>Moreover, it started out as a clicker, but somewhere along the way I found a cool tutorial and it became a freakin space shooter.<br/></p>\n<p>*** (WASD or arrow keys to move), (spacebar or mouse LB to shoot)</p>\n<p>I plan on continuing workin on this game to see how cool I\u00a0can make it!</p>\n<p>All assets and music were made by me. It's not a clicker game, but I\u00a0learned a lot and had fun. Hope ya enjoy my lil project!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cheers! &gt;~&lt;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T17:13:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f1/8f10d5630972ec684589690b2df7965f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pazzi"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
