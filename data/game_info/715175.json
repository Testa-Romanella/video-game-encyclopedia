The Rainbow Flower singlehandedly holds together the peace and goodwill on the planet, and for many years, it has been undisturbed from its glass case... that is, until the dastardly Dr. Mouse decided to steal it for his own personal gain. With the flower in his hands, Dr. Mouse had almost immediately turned the planet into a nightmarish wasteland, and the entire planet drowned in fear and darkness. All was lost... or so they thought, as Q-Boy had immediately jumped into action to defeat Dr. Mouse! Do you have what it takes to take back the Rainbow Flower and restore peace to Planet Phantom?</p>\r\nFURTHER DETAILS\r\n<p>This is an (unfinished) remake of the video game, Q-Boy, which was originally developed and published in 1994 by the company Thin Chen Enterprise Co. Ltd/Sachen exclusively for the Nintendo Entertainment System. This remake is not a 1:1 conversion of the original game, and there are many areas where modifications are found, either because I couldn't replicate them exactly, or they are supposed to be ease-of-life changes.</p>\n<p>I have worked on this game for almost two years, and I am still not done. What you see in the demo is everything that is in either a fully functional or at least working state.</p>\n<p>If you have anything you would like to say about the game, found a bug, would like to post me some hate mail, or just have questions, you can contact me at:</p>\n<p>Email: cl1ppitth3pap3rcl1poffice97@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Twitter: @ArnoldArmadillo</p>\n<p>YouTube: Clippit 97</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71c94ca5f0e0c3ea0fe61a40b978ac1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arnold Armadillo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
