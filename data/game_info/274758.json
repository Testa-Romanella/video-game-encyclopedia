We knew it were lying and we did it anyway. We\u2019ve carried that shame around with us for years, a burden weighing on every moment of every day.<br />\nEnough is enough.<br />\nIt\u2019s time to fix this, to unburden our shame. Let us give you our shame, for you to carry it around instead. We\u2019re sick of it.<br />\nFrom the liars who brought you the award winning indie game The Stanley Parable comes The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, an expansion to the original game with more content, more endings, more whimsical adventures of the two best friends Stanley and The Narrator. Coming to PC and consoles in 2019.<br />\nTastefully seasoned with the bitter remorse of having deceived so many loyal fans for so long.<br />\nBut seriously, this time it\u2019s done. No more.</p>", "metacritic": 90, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-16T19:15:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c4e/c4e3ad247e93d3a5dc40aa215a778a9c.jpg", "website": "https://stanleyparable.com", "rating": 4.4, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 93, "owned": 1011, "beaten": 305, "toplay": 257, "dropped": 50, "playing": 28}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 46, "ratings_count": 289, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 299, "platforms": ["Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "macOS", "PC", "PlayStation 5", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Crows Crows Crows"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crows Crows Crows"], "esrb_rating": null}
