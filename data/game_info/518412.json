Could you comment any feedback below.</p>\n<p>Some questions we would like feedback on are:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>How was the feeling of the character movement?</li><li>Did you find the controls easy to pickup?</li><li>We would also be interested in any feedback/suggestions on how to improve the Grab function within game. Currently an infinitely strong bond is formed between the player and the grabbed object, which is functional, but quite game'y, unintuitive and it can lead to silly situations like the DANA droid being held in the air by grabbing onto an object that's still on a ledge. If you have any thoughts on how the feel of this could be improved, or thoughts on how you feel the grab should work, do let us know.<ul><li>Side note, once you have the grav gun. You can reverse the gravity on a held item and jump with lower gravity :D</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T06:53:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64f7045d5e786050a5f76caed05f8869.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mikethingsbetter"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
