Thank you for taking the time to try this game. It was a lot of fun to create so I hope it's at least a little fun to play. If I'm being honest this project turned out to be more of a proof of concept then a full fledged game. But, I'm hoping to expand on this idea in the future. If that interests you feel free to follow me on Twitter @VoonAtNoon. I'll post any developments there. Thanks again for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8d/d8d3e68e58122d0d7938bb136bc07590.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VoonAtNoon"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
