All she really wants to do is enjoy her new life at uni, join a club, and spend every possible\u00a0waking moment playing Magica Fantasia Online (she's\u00a0<em>not</em> addicted) with her online crush Starsiren.</p>\n<p>She's gonna tell her, OK? Just... when they meet up for MagiCon. Honest.</p>\n<p>However, a\u00a0teeny tiny complication arises on her first day at uni, when Aster just so happens to bump into Maristela,\u00a0<em>the single prettiest girl she's ever seen in her entire life.</em></p>\n<p>And she's not just pretty. Mari's smart, she's funny, and Aster would happily listen to her ramble for hours about whatever the heck she wants to, if only she had a little more courage to do so.</p>\n<p>Torn between the friend she's loved forever, and the new girl who it\u00a0<em>feels</em> like she's always known, Aster faces the toughest decision imaginable, and she's not even been here for a week!</p>\n<p>A game about love, new experiences, and the fact that nerdy neurodivergent girls are cute and you should date them.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Trace</strong> (Tumblr) - Writing / Music Production / Additional Music / Additional Background Art / Creative Director</li><li><strong>Suntann</strong> (Linktree) - Programming / UI Design / SFX / Additional Background Art / Game Assembly</li><li><strong>Arjyles</strong> (Twitter,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Tumblr,\u00a0Redbubble) - Character Art</li><li><strong>Vhalesa</strong> (Tumblr,\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Instagram) - Character Art</li><li><strong>Tanuki-pyon</strong> (Twitter) - Background Art / Insert Art</li><li><strong>S_Khazumi</strong> (Tumblr,\u00a0Twitter, Youtube, Soundcloud) - Music Composition</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T05:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57e/57e19c1f6c689e2e4f8f807b626bcff8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tan", "arjyles", "TracedInAir", "S_Khazumi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
