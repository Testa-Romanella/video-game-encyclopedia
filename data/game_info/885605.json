Survive long enough to share the fire with the world!</p>\n<p><strong>Whole game played with the arrow keys and z/x for menus.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Chop down trees (walk into them) to feed the fire, it consumes wood every button press. Don't let the fire go out, you can see how full it is with the dots above the fire. Feed the fire too much and it will burn faster. Stand near the fire (purple dots) to be safe at night from prowling wolves.\r\n</p>\n<p>Play the orignal LD51 version here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T10:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6df/6df67e0cbcbb94bafd7d3737e2e366de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NorthStateGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
