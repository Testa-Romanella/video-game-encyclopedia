Everything runs according to\u00a0a clock, including your movement. Also it contains some personal opinions on a specific punctuation mark.</p>\n<p>This is my first time entering any kind of game jam, and also\u00a0my first time finishing and releasing anything that could be recognised as a game. I had a lot of fun putting this together, though I don't know how much I can speak for it's quality. At time of writing I've been awake for 22 hours; my opinions cannot be trusted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, this game was gonna have some music to\u00a0go with the obnoxious metronome, but the only composer I know wasn't available at the time. So just imagine a bomb-ass sound track to go along with this janky little game.<br/></p>\n<p>If you have fun with it, well, I've not really got anything else for you to play, but what I do have is a dumb twitter bot.
