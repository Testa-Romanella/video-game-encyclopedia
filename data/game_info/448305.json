It was born out of frustrations with our current party system and government infighting. This mini-game was developed for the Glorious Trainwrecks Pirate Kart 2 in February of\u00a02010. The concept had been floating in my head already and it just needed an opportunity to happen. Don't make too much of it, Partisan Politics is simple.</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>The original score was composed by Parris Khachi aka Doomsday Machines for this game during the jam.</p>\r\nOther SJSU Game Dev Trainwrecks\r\n<p>The San Jose State Game Dev Club held a local jam for the Pirate Kart 2. Check out some of our other submissions to Glorious Train Wrecks.</p>\r\nUpdate\r\n<p>It has been interesting looking back at this game from 10 years in the future. In an effort to preserve it in a post-flash world,\u00a0I created executable builds. This required some minor code rewrites. I added a start button and I took the global high scores out for security reasons.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have the same political sentiment as I did in 2010 but I am nostalgic for my naivet\u00e9.</p>\n<p><strong>partisan_politics_win</strong> Is a self-contained .exe<br/>\n<strong>partisan_politics_swf</strong> Includes a .swf and an html wrapper.<br/>\r\nMac .app version forthcoming.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:17:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c14/c14907d84133aa88678029d0b3f59acc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artfail"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
