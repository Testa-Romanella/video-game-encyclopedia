This means:</p><p>- There are a couple of bugs open left to fix</p><p>- The performance is not what it should be</p><p>- The game's difficulty and technology system may change a lot</p><p>Still, it's quite enjoyable already so I make it available for everyone as of now.</p><p>Advertisements: </p><p>The game shows advertisements through the game using Admob.</p><p>In-app-purchases:</p><p>Pocket Defender has in-app-purchase offers that will charge you in total not more than 5\u20ac (no guarantee if there are further costs of providers involved!). The game is fully playable without paying: The sole advantage of buying the addition is that you'll earn credits 5 times faster. It does not affect highscores, it only quickens your pace of researching all technologies in the game.</p><p>Additionally, it's a pay-what-you-want model: You can chose between 3 price tiers and you can take the price that you believe to be fair for this app. Paying for the game will also disable advertisements (In case it doesn't, it's a bug. Let me know and I will fix it - this is still an alpha!).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3da1aa8ecd2ec97bc5dfd6475d4d5831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Eike Decker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
