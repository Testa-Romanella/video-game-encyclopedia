Only Ceriah's story mode has been scripted so far with events and sprites,\u00a0her brother, Alastair, is only playable within the tavern and outside the tavern.</p>\n<p>The RTP has also been included in the demo.</p>\n<p>Tilesets originally created by REFMAP, which were made to be of free use as long as credit is given. Sprites for the main cast were\u00a0made on charas-project.net, with some minor edits by me. These sprites will be replaced in time with ones made from scratch.</p>\n<p>The game is compatible with any Windows system, I am not sure if it'll run on Mac as I do not own a Mac PC...\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is made purely out of a passion for art and gaming!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the demo!</p>\n<p>Get the latest updates on the game's development over on my Telegram channel!&gt;&gt;&gt;\u00a0\u00a0https://t.me/chroniclesofixiltia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T03:43:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a80/a80e16b54f0a8b2d063edc03e9f6c5f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Aleit Steinherz"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
