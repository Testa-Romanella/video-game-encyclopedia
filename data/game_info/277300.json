I've learned a lot about coding so far with the Godot engine and with all of the very helpful feedback and assistance from the Godot Wild community (Special shoutout to Dalton5000 and Golden for helping with all of my noob-ish questions and problems). I still have <em>a lot</em> to learn, and I hope to continue to improve and add onto\u00a0the small snippet of\u00a0what I've made here for this month's game jam as I improve as a programmer. For this game, I worked closely with a friend of mine that I've known for a long time named Kiki. She designed all of the sprites and various assets that were used\u00a0except for the glorious Cathulu doodle on the poster, while I worked on the coding for the various nodes, scenes, and scripts. The current game is fairly bare bones so far, but I hope to make it better and smoother in the future, and less buggy,\u00a0when I finally have more time to work on it without final exams stealing away my free time. Any constructive criticism or future coding tips\u00a0are appreciated\u00a0\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/8307c69299cce3aa2a0bd97adba43c42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sapphire_Rose", "KiaraT.00"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
