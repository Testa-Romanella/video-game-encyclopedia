This will also clear the 'battery zone' for the next level.<br/>Be warned! Leveling up increases game speed, too. How far can you get?<br/></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1HINTS\ud83d\udca1<br/>The negative and positive ends of the batteries can touch anywhere to link, not just at the ends.<br/>Empty batteries (which you'll sometimes be forced to place somewhere) turn into 'garbage' after landing.<br/>Normal batteries fizzle if they land without connecting to the battery chain.<br/>Fizzled batteries turn into 'garbage' when the next battery is placed, unless the next battery connects the fizzled battery. (This grants you a 'chain bonus.')<br/>Leveling up without storing any power will cost you.<br/>There are two gameplay music tracks. (Covers of two of Chopin's Etudes, in fact!) The music is chosen randomly at the start of each playthrough.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T05:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c60/c6060e874ae5b4f74641af346b63b464.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HacksawUnit"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
