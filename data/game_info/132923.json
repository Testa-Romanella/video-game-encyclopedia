But time is scarce, so you will have to move fast and be careful in how you plot your course in order to get as much loot as possible! Rarer loot is worth more than others, and if you're lucky, you may even find one of the LEGENDARY treasures! Good Luck!</p><p>Game is free to download, but you are welcome to pay in order to support a future of more updates and more games if you want.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>arrow keys: move/aim</p>\n<p>d key: destroy block</p>\n<p>f key: jump</p>\n<p>+ key: pause/unpause game</p>\n<p>Click the Maximize button in the bottom right corner to go full screen.

Check out their stuff, its great.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I corrected a small bug where the full-screen didn't draw text quite centered. I have uploaded the new file, HeartJam1.01, but the old file is still there. They are both the exact same thing, but 1.01 doesn't have the full-screen bug.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d5bcfaa25356907ad4ec63a095c5a46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cofefe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
