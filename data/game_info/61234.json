At the moment there are only three things that can kill you; wolves, weather, and the one you hunt. In order to survive, you must collect sticks to create fires, find ammo to keep your shotgun loaded, and avoid detection from the one you hunt.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThroughout the map there are cabins that can keep you out of the cold. They also contain useful items like snowshoes, ammo, and parkas.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCan you survive this hostile environment and claim the one you hunt?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/009/0096154056cf2d28aa168667cc2785a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan Moye"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jonathan Moye"], "esrb_rating": null}
