Developed with DS Game Maker. One file has NitroFS enabled and one doesn't. The NitroFS file has sound but will not work on many cartridges for the Nintendo DS. NitroFS does however work on emulators.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Big thanks to redshibe and Demi and the Goons for content used in the game and for the general idea of the game.
