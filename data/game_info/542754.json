I'm actively working on it right now, and a lot has changed since when this was formalized. I'm hoping to put up a proper 1.0 Vertical Slice build by Q2 of this year, but for now there's a lot I'm happy with about this build, which was build 0.4.1.2. In the mean time I stream sometimes whenever I'm not feeling too self conscious.<br/><br/>Currently, there's a few fights you can explore, and a boss that lives on top of the hill. Each fight is 1v1. The voxel environments were made by me using MagicaVoxel, and the pixel art is by rvros. The music is In Love With A Ghost. If you like any of their work, please support them!<br/><br/>The game is made for controllers but keyboard and mouse works perfectly well.<br/><br/>Buttons are mapped like this, if you want to play it with a mouse and keyboard:<br/>B is Right Click (To initiate combat)<br/>A is Space (for jump)<br/>X is Shift (For Dash)<br/>Y is R (To end combat)<br/>Q and E are RB and LB, to rotate the camera<br/>WASD is left joystick, to move around.<br/>Click cards to play them, or play the darkened card with A/Space<br/><br/>I'm interested in whatever feedback you have, but I'm particularly interested in what specs you have and if you're able to run it. I can't get it to run particularly well on my xbone without optimization, but my GTX 780 and my friend's GTX 670 were able to handle the lighting system I used. As far as I can tell, no integrated graphics I've tried using with it has worked very well.<br/><br/>Current features that are implemented in a newer build:<br/>-View your entire deck<br/>-Saving and Loading<br/>-Better controller support<br/>-More card variety<br/>-Multiple enemies per fight<br/>-Summonable Allies<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T03:33:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b8/5b81c4d69b4948a83c1e57f245e162c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nudemanonbike"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
