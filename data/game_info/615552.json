The game also has hidden secret levels that you can find in the game. Almost every level has points in them and collecting all the points can give you a high rank when you finish the stage.</p>\n<p>Bounce A Ball Features:</p>\n<p>- Ten main game levels</p>\n<p>- Five secret levels (The codes for the levels are found in the main game levels)</p>\n<p>- Different customization options for the player</p>\n<p>- Hardmode (Does not affect secret levels)</p>\n\n<p>This game was first created as a school project and it's original plan was to have it a endless platform, those plans changed when I discovered the physic material. I reworked my plans and had the game be a ten level game that uses this bouncing skill.</p>\n<p>Update 1.6 (Water on Mars update): Water physics for the player has been changed. Secret Level 5 (Lost on Mars) had some slight performance improvements. Changes done to the spring pad to make the launching cleaner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T06:35:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c99e8b68c2085fbcae1d999ab6aa431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Minecraft_Stove"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
