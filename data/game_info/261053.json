{"id": 261053, "slug": "strikeoppose", "name": "Strike&Oppose", "name_original": "Strike&Oppose", "description": "<p>Strike&amp;Oppose documentation:</p>\n<p>Since most of the game documenation is in-game.\u00a0<br/>This documentation supplements the details of the<br/>games mechanics. It also explains the premise or\u00a0<br/>notion of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Strike&amp;Oppose's creation is inspired by\u00a0 various<br/>game idea's.\u00a0 One of them is 'Rockem_Sockem. A\u00a0<br/>old mattel game where the idea of the game was to<br/>win by knocking the other robot's head off!\u00a0 Other<br/>ideas are from select game genres I grew up with.</p>\n<p>The simplified equation is this:</p>\n<p>missile command + space invaders + capture the<br/>flag + shooter + rockem sockem.</p>\n<p>intentionally, Strike&amp;Oppose is meant to be a push game.<br/>In which, the player must push the enemy back away<br/>from the finish line!!!\u00a0 Or, destroy the enemy all-to<br/>-gether.\u00a0 In some zones the player must simply make<br/>it to the finish line. With the first case meaning the<br/>player must reach the finish line first.\u00a0 The second case<br/>is destroying the enemy tank all-together(rockem sockem).</p>\n<p>Regardless, the intent is meant to be a PUSH-back effect\u00a0<br/>that the player must achieve to win! Like rockem sockem,<br/>the player must PUSH for victory! With the added\u00a0<br/>bonus of two-ways in lieu of one.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Controls for the PC are as follows:</p>\n<p>left-mouse = fire. Target cursor movement\u00a0 is navigated<br/>\u00a0with the mouse.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Controls for touch devices:<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Strike&amp;Oppose on touch devices will play a bit differently<br/>\u00a0than the PC version.\u00a0 Pressing and dragging techniques<br/>\u00a0will be done differently than normal PC mouse operations.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0It's best to just touch the buttons needed\u00a0 and point to<br/>\u00a0destroy.\u00a0 In most cases an alien finger print will show when<br/>\u00a0a button is pressed when it's most relevant.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0RULES:<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0First one to reach the finish line wins.<br/>\u00a0First one destroyed loses.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0PRIMARY WEAPONS: Push back the enemy tank but<br/>\u00a0have no effect on most surrounding enemy ships.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0SECONDARY WEAPONS: Can damage the enemy<br/>\u00a0tank but have no push-back effect. Secondary\u00a0<br/>\u00a0weapons can destroy most surrounding enemies.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0TARGETING CURSOR: Can destroy or deflect certain<br/>\u00a0objects.\u00a0 It's also to select between missile attacks\u00a0<br/>\u00a0and buttons attacks on the players tank. It will change<br/>\u00a0into a 'X' cursor for missile attacks. While in the 'X'\u00a0<br/>\u00a0state the cursor is limited to certain actions. Certain<br/>\u00a0objects cannot be deflected while using the missile<br/>\u00a0'X' cursor.\u00a0 Otherwise,\u00a0 the cursor remains in an 'O'<br/>\u00a0shape.\u00a0 This shape can deflect objects and does not<br/>\u00a0require reloading from mobile city defences. However,<br/>\u00a0both 'X' and 'O' can use the spinner board option if\u00a0<br/>\u00a0selected. 'O' cursor also is used to angle secondary<br/>\u00a0weapons if enabled.\u00a0 Afterwards, press the gun<br/>\u00a0turrets themselves to fire. Despite secondary guns<br/>\u00a0having\u00a0 limited angles they are very effected against<br/>\u00a0 most\u00a0 common enemies.\u00a0 Enemies not effected<br/>\u00a0must be realized by the player.<br/>\u00a0<br/>MOBILE CITY DEFENSES:</p>\n<p>Mobile city defenses are used to augment the player's<br/>defense.\u00a0 Depending on the game enabled in the extra<br/>options settings.\u00a0 There are two types of mobile<br/>city defenses.\u00a0 One will be for missile attacks.<br/>The second will be for resupplying\u00a0 the player's secondary<br/>weapons.\u00a0 If secondary\u00a0 weapons are enabled in the<br/>extra options screen. Then each token collected when<br/>released from that specific city defense will add to the<br/>secondary weapons stockpile.\u00a0 Unless, the city is<br/>destroyed or depending on the game mode.<br/>Regardless, of what mode selected both defenses are<br/>present in later zones.</p>\n<p>Depending on what option is enabled in the extra\u00a0<br/>options sceen.\u00a0 The mobile city defensed may be\u00a0<br/>reversed.\u00a0 In addition, stockpile levels are depicted by<br/>the skill level selected by the player.\u00a0 '1' being the least<br/>difficult and '3' being very difficult.</p>\n<p>In accord with the primary mobile city defense. EMP\u00a0<br/>blasts will deflect most shellings depending on the\u00a0<br/>strength of the enemy's defenses.\u00a0 However, it has no<br/>effect on the enemy's primary weapons...\u00a0 If the player<br/>survives a zone with the primary mobile city defense<br/>intact then the EMP burst are expanded at the cost\u00a0<br/>of the primary mobile city's stockpile.. The bigger the\u00a0<br/>boom, the bigger cost to the primary mobile city defenses<br/>stockpile.\u00a0 Again, this is depended on many factors\u00a0<br/>including the skill level selected.\u00a0 There's '5' levels to the<br/>EMP burst's expansion.\u00a0 Afterwards, no more build up.<br/>In general, if the primary mobile city defense is lost in<br/>a zone then the EMP expansion is set back to '1'.\u00a0<br/>Which is the size of the 'O' cursor.</p>\n<p>CAREPACKAGES:</p>\n<p>Carepackages aid in the war effort and are flown in\u00a0<br/>via drop plane.\u00a0 If the drop plane is lost then no care-<br/>package.\u00a0 Carepackages come in the form of extra<br/>ammo for the player's tank primary weapon, the<br/>primary mobile city defense(EMP) ammo, extra\u00a0<br/>speed, or extra health.\u00a0 Each carepackage is dropped<br/>at random so each game will be different.\u00a0 In the earlier<br/>zones carepackage drops are free.\u00a0 But later, cost\u00a0<br/>victory points.</p>\n<p>ATTACK PLANES:</p>\n<p>Attack planes allow the player to press the plane and<br/>fire random graviton shells(or BOMBS).\u00a0 The amount and<br/>style are different each game upto a finite limit.\u00a0 Graviton<br/>shells can hurt the enemy's tank and destroy other enemy<br/>hazards.\u00a0 They are free in earlier zones but cost in later<br/>zones. Protect the plane while fighting in a zone or else lose<br/>the plane to enemy missile fire or to other hazards. Again,<br/>nothing hurts the enemy tank like the player's primary\u00a0<br/>weapon!!!!</p>\n<p>SPINNER BOARD:</p>\n<p>The spinner board effects the outcome in strike&amp;oppose<br/>drastically!!!\u00a0 Though, the board's spins are limited by a\u00a0<br/>countdown.\u00a0 They can help or hinder the player's outcome<br/>considerably without consideration to the player's victory.</p>\n<p>It's operation is random within a finite order.\u00a0 So, be prepared<br/>for strike&amp;oppose not to take sides!!!!\u00a0 It is selected in the\u00a0<br/>extra options screen.</p>\n<p>CLOSING WALLS:</p>\n<p>If selected in the extra options screen. A spiked wall will appear<br/>shortly after a zone starts.\u00a0 It does not hurt the mobile city<br/>defenses. However, it does destroy the player's tank if pushed<br/>back far enough.\u00a0 It cannot be destroyed as well. Choose this for<br/>a extra challenge. Beware though, it makes later zones next too<br/>impossible!!!!.\u00a0 \u00a0It's also best to enable the secondary weapons<br/>option along with the closing walls option.</p>\n<p>ENABLE MOBILE CITY DEFENSE:</p>\n<p>If enabled, at least one city must survive.\u00a0 If not the game is\u00a0<br/>over.\u00a0 Enable this for an increased challenge....In this mode\u00a0<br/>the mobile city defenses will be reversed.</p>\n<p>VICTORY POINTS:</p>\n<p>Carepackages and attack planes are amongst the<br/>items that can be purchased with victory points.\u00a0 If<br/>certain skill levels are chosen then victory points will\u00a0<br/>be used to buy the player's primary weapon's pulses.<br/>This is automatic so that the player won't run out of\u00a0<br/>ammo or it's main artillary.\u00a0 Victory points do no buy<br/>the player's secondary weapon's artillary.\u00a0 Secondary<br/>ammo is created via a token from the mobile city\u00a0<br/>defense base that creates them..<br/>Victory points will also float away faster than others.<br/>The faster the victory point moves outta of the screen<br/>the more it gives when collected.</p>\n<p>OTHER OPTIONS:</p>\n<p>Options such as: Sound and the game's FPS(or frame<br/>rate) can be selected in arbitrary upon the player's\u00a0<br/>desire.\u00a0 Sound is enabled by default and the standard<br/>FPS is meant to be 30 FPS if enabled.</p>\n<p>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:</p>\n<p>Below is a short description on how to deal with\u00a0<br/>some of the enemy's obstacles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>MISSILES: are red and will leave a streak upon burst.<br/>they are destroyed with EMP burst in general.</p>\n<p>BOMBS: heavy bombs(white) can be destroyed by EMP<br/>burst. Enemy fighter bombs(brown) can be destroyed\u00a0<br/>with EMP bursts or 'O' cursor will stop them.</p>\n<p>METEORS,BASEBALLS, AND OTHER STRANGE OBJECTS:</p>\n<p>Can all be deflected by the 'O' cursor.\u00a0 Some items<br/>must be deflected out of the game screen's perimeter<br/>in order to be effective.</p>\n<p>ENEMY BOMBERS:</p>\n<p>Some can be destroyed by EMP's or soley with the<br/>'O' cursor.\u00a0 Experiment to find out!!!!\u00a0 In general,<br/>a alien fingerprint will be displayed if the 'O' cursor is\u00a0<br/>able to be applied.</p>\n<p>ENEMY BOSS:</p>\n<p>When the enemy boss appears. The player must destroy<br/>it with EMP blast's before it leaves the playfield.\u00a0<br/>In general, destroying it gives a good amount of victory<br/>points. Also, the spinnerboard option affects boss play<br/>extremely. All three nodes must be destroyed in no<br/>particular order.</p>\n<p>ENEMY SUBUNITS-MOBILE TANKS:</p>\n<p>These small enemy support tanks come in a wide<br/>configuration.\u00a0 It's best not to let these units\u00a0 make it<br/>to the finish line.\u00a0 If so, then the player must take the<br/>brunt of the penalty that occurs. Each unit carries it's<br/>own penalty. So, penaltys can happen in multiples.<br/>These units are destrpyed with EMP blast.</p>\n<p>SPINNER TYPE:</p>\n<p>There are '3' spinner types that can be selected:\u00a0<br/>'1' is the basic spinner setup.<br/>'2' is half and half.<br/>'3' is always random.</p>\n<p>SKILL LEVELS:</p>\n<p>As of this writing, skill levels rate from '1' - easy; thru<br/>'3' being the hardest.\u00a0 In general, skill level settings<br/>affect reload times, countdown times, ammo amounts,<br/>and other strange settings not foreseen by the player<br/>during game play.</p>\n<p>ZONE SELECT:</p>\n<p>The player can select from zone 1 thru zone 35. If the<br/>player makes it thru zone 35 or above. The zone select<br/>will remember the last zone defeated.\u00a0 However, if\u00a0<br/>Strike&amp;Oppose is reset thru the browser then all extra\u00a0<br/>options are reset!</p>\n<p>GAME PLAY BEST PRACTICES:</p>\n<p>Strike&amp;Oppose is meant to be played by all ages.\u00a0 It is<br/>intentionally set to be very easy from the 1st zone.<br/>Therefore, zones may seem redundant for experienced\u00a0<br/>gamers.\u00a0 Each zone before '23' is meant as a play<br/>along tutiorial without heavy bombardment as in later<br/>zones. With normal game settings it will not start to<br/>pick up until after zone 13.\u00a0 It's best to learn zone<br/>patterns and try to remember each zone. In addtion,\u00a0<br/>it's best not to overload 1st time play with all the\u00a0<br/>settings in the extra-options screen.\u00a0 Play it with the\u00a0<br/>normal settings before playing with other options.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Switching between 'O' and 'X' cursor!!!<br/>If done poorly, it can cost the game.\u00a0 If done with good<br/>timing, the player can shield the tank from damage.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Victory points and EMP power settings are\u00a0<br/>reset replaying\u00a0 a zone lost.</p>\n<p>GAME NOTES:</p>\n<p>Below are game specifics relating to the current build<br/>of Strike&amp;Oppose(v1).</p>\n<p>*Sound may not be present if the touch device does<br/>NOT conform to the standard HTML5 practices.<br/>CHROME or FIREFOX on smaller devices.<br/>I do not specialize sound for multiple browser formatting.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nor, do I for any particular device.
