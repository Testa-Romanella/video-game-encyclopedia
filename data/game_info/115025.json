My plan was to make a 2.5D platformer based on animal mascot platformers of the 90s, whilst having a contextual message about deforestation, endangered tribes and corporate greed.</p>\n<p>The game was designed around a simple to use mouse only control setup. I designed this with those who have disabilities in mind. The simple mouse movement controls could be mapped easily to any special needs controllers for those with an arm amputation, poorly functioning motor skills or any other disability that requires special equipment to play games.</p>\n<p>After doing some reflection on the project, there are many things I could have improved or have done differently. I ended up using Mixamo auto rigging because I had issues rigging at first, but I could have used more of my time to focus on rigging characters manually. I could have also used time to improve many textures on the models, and I should have used a better variety of Photoshop techniques for these. Enemies stopped working the way they were intended to nearing the end of the project after trying to implement shooting, meaning I should have implemented that much earlier on rather than leaving it to later.</p>\n<p>Other than those gripes, I'm still happy with what I have made. All of these negatives will be taken into account for future projects and university.</p>\n<p>Game design and characters by Louis Le Blanc<br/>Cutscene narration by David McFaddin<br/>Music by GalaxyTrail, used with permission<br/>Developed with Unreal Engine\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5ff6464a4ad3a582378c8b4e15ff280.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EAPyoutube"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
