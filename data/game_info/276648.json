The final act of the human race as Earthlings was to build four massive ships that would hold the sum of our kind. The ships were sent out into the far reaches of the universe in hopes that we might find a new home for mankind. <br/><br/>Roughly twenty two hundred years later one did! The planet was 98% compatible. Until then the best rating had been less than 5%. The planet's original inhabitants seemed to have suffered a species ending event that left the planet more or less intact.<br/><br/>After a thorough assessment while in orbit we landed and began to colonize. Our disassembled ship became strong walls around the colony, keeping out the wandering, ruthless monsters that were the shadows of the planet's previous tenants. <br/><br/>A message was sent to the other three ships so that they could make their way to Humanity's new home, as they had all planned so long ago. <br/><br/>Now, we are left to prepare for their arrival. We must build our small colony into a great empire, fight off the demons of the new world, and conquer the unruly landscape of our new home.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ce/6ce5b2d4f789ce7d67313b1a32160a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Sea Creature Sandwich"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sea Creature Sandwich"], "esrb_rating": null}
