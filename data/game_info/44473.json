{"id": 44473, "slug": "hereafter", "name": "Hereafter", "name_original": "Hereafter", "description": "Deep in an old forgotten laboratory, a failed experiment reboots from its sleep. With no memories, it now must explore the many different areas of the extensive complex to hopefully find some answers concerning its origins and the disappearance of its creator.<br />\nWith the help of MUSE, an intelligent AI created by and also abandoned by the same creator to monitor and manage various extensive experiments, the player will explore diverse environments filled with a myriad of unique enemies in the forms of other failed experiments which have been left to roam the abandoned facility as they please creating all kinds of havoc and especially making problems for the poor AI, MUSE, who wants nothing more than a well-organized system of experimental inventiveness.<br />\nMake use of the Data File system to slowly uncover the larger story as you find various Data Files around the facility and bring them back to MUSE for decoding.<br />\nInteract with a host of intelligent characters, both friends and foes, to make your way through the long abandoned complex on your search for answers!<br />\nEquip a multitude of diverse weapons and armors found throughout the complex to arm yourself against the hoard of unruly experiments. Using a combination of both melee as well as ranged weapons to customize your play-style!<br />\nSolve puzzles and traverse challenging environments on your journey to discover the truth of your origins and the reason behind your creator&#39;s disappearance!<br />\nTake advantage of a generous save terminals system as you make your way deeper into the dangerous laboratory, it&#39;s no fun to fight through the same areas again and again upon defeat, or skip them all and attempt to beat the game with a single life! If you think you&#39;re skilled enough to do so!<br />\nPlay around with a rocket boots jump boost system that actually takes some skill to fully master! Players who can master the timing of this physics propelled force will find it easier to traverse the levels of the game than those who don&#39;t!<br />\nTake advantage of the odd currency system involving metal, medals, which has somehow developed among the more intelligent experiments in the facility to provide some means of payment for goods and services which have sprung up in their creator&#39;s absence and buy useful items and upgrades from the shop to help you in your journey.<br />\nAnd of course....Challenging Boss Fights! Fight a number of challenging bosses, as well as regular enemies which may be considered to be mini-bosses by some, that block your path to the answers you seek!About the Game&#39;s Development and Development Team<br />\nThis is the first attempt at making a video game by our 2 person development team of brothers. One person uses the pixel software &quot;Aesprite&quot; to create the sprites and pixel art as well as &quot;Finale Notepad&quot; to compose the unique music while the other uses &quot;Unity 2D&quot; to bring it all together with the programing.<br />\nAs this is our first attempt at making a video game, we are of course very eager to see what the Steam Community thinks about our work and gladly accept any input and constructive criticism as well as any helpful info on how to make our game better!<br />\nThe Art Style and Music Style are intended to be reminiscent of older 2D pixel games such as &quot;Castlevania&quot; and &quot;Megaman&quot;.<br />\nThe demo for this game is complete and the plan is to make it available on steam first as the full game is still being developed. This may take some time as both developers have many other life obligations such as work and school though both also greatly desire to get the full game finished as soon as possible. Once the full game is finished we&#39;d like to have that available on steam, either for some price or possibly free as we&#39;re still considering how to price the full game, as well as the free demo.<br />\nThe demo includes 2 levels. The goal for the finished game is currently 10 levels though more may be added as the development team is always thinking of more content to add to the game!<br />\nThe demo is controller compatible, with keyboard also being an option.<br />\nThis game is a work of love so try it out and let us know what you think! Helpful suggestions to improve it are always welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T10:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/802/80238ade66de3c4b6b46eb85c028ce58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 112, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Micah Brown", "Benjamin Brown"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nathan Brown"], "esrb_rating": null}
