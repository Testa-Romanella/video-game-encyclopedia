As far as she's concerned, that's the worst thing to happen to anyone tonight. If only she was right.</p>\n<p>Her friends' post-prom partying has just been interrupted by a serial killer, and now there's a massacre happening down at the old lover's lane. Teenage blood is spilling. Limbs are flying. The town's dark past is coming back with a vengeance. And Dawn is oblivious to all of it. She's only interested in what horror movie to watch next, not the one unspooling down the road...</p>\n\n<p><em>Home on Prom Night</em> is a short parody of '80s slasher movie tropes, seen through the eyes of someone whose only concept of a knife in the back is her friends signing up for camp counsellor jobs without her.</p>\n<p>With all original pixel art and sound effects.<br/>Secret ending?
