You're surrounded.. Harmless NPCs mostly, but there's some players blending in with them.<br/>How will you find them?<br/>How will they find you?</p><p>This is a game for 2 or more players, with up to 64 NPCs.You can play over LAN or WAN. There's no Server Browser (yet), so you'll have to connect directly via IP.</p><p><strong>NETWORK PROBLEMS:</strong><strong> </strong>If you're having troubles connecting to other players, there are 2 usual causes: The Firewall, and the Router. All players should make sure their firewall isn't blocking the game in any way, or it likely won't connect.</p><p>The latest update added NAT punchthrough, which should prevent the router from causing problems. If problems remain, the host should forward the port being used on their router (default 7777). How to do either of these depends on your OS/router, so you'll need to search online for the best way. If it still doesn't work, let me know.</p><p><strong>HOW TO UPDATE:</strong> When getting a message about an update being available, simply re-download the game from this page - it will be the latest version. Alternatively, you can keep the game automatically updated with the Itch App (https://itch.io/app).</p><p>Update 0.1.8a: Engine updated (includes various network fixes).</p><p>Update 0.1.7abc: A: New level - Host can pick the level in the GAME CONFIG menu in the Lobby. Lots of optimizations and bug fixes (including walking bug?). B: Added NAT Punchthrough (Experimental, but seems stable) - it should now be easier to connect to other players, hopefully without the need for portforwarding. Version check bypass has been added, but should only be used if you know you have the latest version, or everyone else has the same version. C: Different versions might not work properly with eachother. UI now scales to screen size - JOIN button no longer appears off-screen on 5:4 monitors.</p><p>Update 0.1.6ab: Engine upgrade, Quality options in Pause Menu, more stable network connection, fixed bug where only one person readying-up would start the game, instead of all. Disabled GPU Skinning (should make things better for anyone without a GPU). Bug fixes.</p><p>Update 0.1.5abc: Updated engine version. Networking should be better, input shouldn't be dropped, input no longer based on camera, along with other optimizations.</p><p>Update 0.1.4ab: Added basic Options menu (sensitivity, invert Y-Look), reduced download + overall filesize. Solved walk bug (should work on all devices and keyboards now) and rotation error (output_log shouldn't get spammed with Quaternion errors)</p><p>Note: This is super-alpha. The core of the game exists, but it's still pretty basic. I've tried to make it as latency-friendly as possible, but emulating high-latency is pretty useless compared to actual high-latency.</p><p>So, if you experience any issues due to networking, or have some ideas/feedback, please let me know either by email (contact@pheonise.com), or on twitter (@Pheonise).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/535eaa0e15f91324dc4b318a9befbd4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pheonise"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
