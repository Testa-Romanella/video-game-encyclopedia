A, a Beyonder sorcerer with seemingly no peer in this universe in anything involving his art and Eleria that like Enok seems to be a chosen of many worlds herself. Soon, their new allies reveal to them that their common Beyonder enemies have targeted the races of Netherspace repeatedly, but have so far been unable to overcome their resistance due to their innate psionic strength and the support of the powerful Beyonder sorcerer, A. Facing a blight that will annihilate all the people of Eleria's race in the coming decades, she agrees to act as a diplomat to ensure the alliance of the Andraxian creators of Istradarion with her people. Soon, with the assistance of the AI companion of Enok, the original Netherpiercer spaceship is dismantled and with its resulting materials, four new spacecrafts are created. Though far weaker that their original, through Eleria's and A's powers they are bound to each pilot's strengths so as to perfectly grow along with them in all aspects, in such uncanny ways that will eventually make them dramatically dwarf the power of the Netherpiercer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd thus a new fantastic journey begins...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T02:53:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/115/115e795d33fc404eea51f442bbd6ca18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Konstantinos Katsoris"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Konstantinos Katsoris"], "esrb_rating": null}
