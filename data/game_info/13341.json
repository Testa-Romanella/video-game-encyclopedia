The only match to their (very lacking) skills is their lousy temperament. They will rush head-first into desperate combats, fall into the most obvious traps, get cursed, poisoned, paralysed, vampirized, or \u2013 even \u2013 killed. It is up to you to ensure they will endure the most grievous wounds and survive their ordeals, in spite of their cripling noobishness.<br/><br/>You are their only hope. You are... their <strong>healer</strong> !<br/><br/><strong>Features :</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Learn to use 18 different <strong>spells</strong>. <br/></li><li>Upgrade them to customize your strategy.
