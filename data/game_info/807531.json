It's easy to play and very fun!You can play both from PC and later the version for Android will arrive, but if you want you can always play with the web commands from the phone.\u00a0I suggest you to play from PC because the phone version is not very stable, but if you have got a good phone you can play with them.</p>\n<p>Thanks\u00a0 Pixel Frog for a spectacular pixel art, very cool!\u00a0</p>\n<p>One more thing, the game is in testing phase, so it will have obvious bugs to fix, they will be fixed soon and more levels will be added as well.</p>\n<p>If you like the game, put a nice like and if you want, I insert the possibility to donate some dollars to finance my future project.
