The\u00a0<strong>two main features</strong>\u00a0focused on in this game are<strong>\u00a0shooting and objects</strong>\u00a0<strong>that can be</strong>\u00a0<strong>picked</strong>\u00a0<strong>up moved and thrown.</strong>\u00a0The range is equipped with various weapon pick-ups, ammo, and health packs. Also, it includes a few different targets to shoot with some destructible objects\u00a0that can be picked up and moved. The idea of this project is to build a good FPS foundation with basic core features to be able to use in future projects.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you are looking to learn more about RetroRange, the following listing below includes more in-depth details about the game.
