{"id": 828912, "slug": "evocards", "name": "EvoCards", "name_original": "EvoCards", "description": "<p>EvoCards is a completely free online multiplayer card game hosted at https://evocards.de and can be played with up to four players (three players are required to start the countdown). <strong>No download or registration required!</strong> One game of EvoCards consists of multiple rounds (until only one player remains). Each round has three different phases:</p>\n<ol><li>Shop - Here you can buy new cards for your deck using coins you've gathered during the match. You can buy up to one attack and one mana card.</li><li>Play - This is where the main action happens. Choose a player you want to attacks, as well as an attack and a mana card.</li><li>Round Summary - The round summary shows the player and the cards that each player has chosen this round.</li></ol>\n<p>Your goal is to eliminate all other players by buying cards in the shop and playing them against your competitors. With each round the cards you can find in the shop are more powerful as they are evolving over \"time\". Make sure to always save enough of your coins and to make the correct buying decisions.</p>\n<p>The cards you have available during the play phase are randomly chosen from your deck (which consists of the cards you've bought from the shop). Therefore it is not recommended to buy a card multiple times unless you really want it to have a higher chance of being available during the play phase.</p>\n<p>The round summary doesn't require you to do anything. It's just to make it more clear what has happened in this round.</p>\n<p>Further details about the effects and uses of each card will be included in a future update.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>It is recommended NOT to minimize the browser window, put it into the background or to change tabs while playing EvoCards! This could result in your client getting disconnected from the server and therefore losing the match.</strong></p>\n<p>Graphics made by Imperiatos.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T06:32:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/120e8ceeeae9975741d7829221364f37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Techcrafter"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
