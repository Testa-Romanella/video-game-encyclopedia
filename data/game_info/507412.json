This is only the demo, as well as the prologue.\u00a0I\u00a0would like to make this an episodic game if I'm able and depending on the feedback this gets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have lived your whole life in the mountains among the Forsaken to learn about your unique powers in peace , away from everything and everyone. You felt at home there, content with your quest for knowledge and wisdom, living among your peers. However, one year something shifted. Tensions started growing, people changed and you felt something ominous was settling in.\u00a0 After years of feeling more and more oppressed, you realised you didn't feel at home anymore. One night you decide to escape, to see what's beyond these mountains. But your freedom will be short lived, as you realise you can't really flee from who you are.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The characters below <strong>don't appear in the demo</strong>, but you'll meet them soon in the following chapters, if this becomes a full game.
