A digital root is calculated by taking the sum of all digits until only one digit is left.</p>\n<p>Example for 642:</p>\n<p>642 -&gt; 6 + 4 + 2 = 12</p>\n<p>12 -&gt; 1 + 2 = 3</p>\n<p>The digital root of 642 is 3. Each game is played over 5 rounds. For each turn, the player<strong> must</strong> <strong>choose at least 1</strong> of the 3 dice they rolled which is then added to their score. If a player rolls and chooses <strong>2\u00a0of the same number,</strong> this <strong>will swap the scores.</strong> Any number over 9 will be converted into a digital root. <strong>Lowest score</strong> after 5 rounds <strong>wins</strong>. Bonus rounds are played when both players have the same score.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/966/9662fa752905cbb3d09a7c5ad9589059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RevTheGame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
