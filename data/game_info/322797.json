I've learned a lot in this time, and figured I\u00a0might as well release it.\u00a0There are six different ships to unlock, and each one is slightly different like the shuttle with its high HP and missiles and the rocket with its burst laser. Collect coins to unlock ships and beat your high score, and try to blast through the debris and mini-boss battles! The game can be played in browser, with an executable .jar on the desktop, or on Android devices.<br/><br/>On desktop, browser:\u00a0Move left and right with WASD, shoot with left mouse or spacebar.<br/></p>\n<p>On android: Move left and right by tilting, shoot by tapping.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n\n\n<p>Made using\u00a0LibGDX.</p>\n<p>Music from\u00a0Incompetech.<br/></p>\n<p>\"Arcadia\", \"Salty Ditty\"<br/>Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n\n<p>This game is open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0\u00a0(tl:dr, do whatever you want with it as long as you keep it with the same license i.e.\u00a0open source).
