Good and bad ending.<br/><br/>The main characters:<br/>\u00a0Sabina Glyantseva is the most mysterious girl I've ever seen in this place. Never fit herself to talk. She loves when she is asked about something, but at the same time all this information needs to be pulled out of her. I would even say she does not feel any emotions at all! Always walks with the same expression on his face, to any question or request he answers with a meek answer. Always comes to the dining room for breakfast, lunch, dinner, but never eats anything! Even I can not suspect what her diagnosis. (from the personal diary of Sergei Ustinov).<br/>[/img]\n\u00a0Nelli Ranevskaya ... There is an approach to all people. This is true. But you need to try very hard to find an approach. The fighting spirit girl will never go on handouts, but it can not stand when someone behaves not like her. It is extremely aggressive, I would even say, it is like a nuclear bomb, if not cooled in time, it will explode and sweep away everything in its path. Uses blows in return for gestures of his speech. (from the personal diary of Sergei Ustinov)\n[img] {STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/\u041d\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0438.jpg [/ img]\n\u00a0Eva Angelic, sometimes she behaves really like an Angel, but sometimes she scares me with her behavior. After an hour of intercourse, I realized that she had exactly bipolar disorder. Perso<br/>\u00a0Masha Abramova, the reasons for which I call her diminutive pet two. First, despite the adult appearance, she always behaves like a child. Eternally speaks like a child, only with simple and gentle words. Naive. Loves sports and play. For any trifle, she can declare that you are no longer her friend and will be offended. And secondly, the reason for this is that I do not even know her full name. Someone calls her Mariyana, someone Maria. I do not know who to believe. (from the personal diary of Sergei Ustinov)<br/>[/img]\n\u00a0Nelli Ranevskaya ... There is an approach to all people.

After an hour of intercourse, I realized that she had exactly bipolar disorder. Personally, I like it better when she behaves very happily and seems to fly in the magical dreams of the beautiful. However, such a magical mood can immediately be replaced by severe depression and a continuous desire to kill yourself. Very interesting person, but sometimes I'm scared for her.

Brought up, good, there are leadership skills. Helps everyone and everything in this place. From simple patients like me to orderlies. It is rumored to be in this place almost the longest. I noticed that we are very similar. Maybe she has schizophrenia? (from the personal diary of Sergei Ustinov)<br/><br/>\u00a0Nelli Ranevskaya ... There is an approach to all people. This is true.
