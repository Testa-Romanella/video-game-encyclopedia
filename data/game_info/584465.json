The Windows version is fine!)</p>\n<p>Senjaiko is a local 2 Player turn based strategy game, set in 3 cute and cartoonish islands. Your main goal is to destroy your\u00a0\u00a0opponents castle. On the battlefield/ Island you can place 8 different and\u00a0unique units, and do actions with them. The game includes 3 Islands (Golden Islands, Frozen Sea, Vulaava) + a tutorial that explains you the rules of the game.\u00a0 Have fun playing with a friend or family member.</p>\n\n<p>---------------------Credits--------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>made by Daniel Muenstermann\r\n</p>\n<p>Assets used:\r\n</p>\n<p>All In 1 Shader\r\n</p>\n<p>Ultimate Sound FX Bundle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T04:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/865/86540b86df4c38edd4d7a0f2bc138a27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ryder Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
