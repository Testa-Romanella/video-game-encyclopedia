Sebastian is tired of his dead-end job as a Grim Reaper and wants to pursue his dream of becoming a songwriter. Lacking inspiration (and friends), he asks you to help him with his next hit by letting him write a song about your life.<br/><br/>Using state of the art spatial audio technology, Sebastian creates a custom soundtrack and soundscape about your adventures using the time of day, the weather and even your own spatial orientation. Find magic in the mundane through the joys of songwriting.<br/><br/>This game has enhanced interactivity and immersion with the Bose AR Frames, the Q700 Noise Reducing Headphones, and other Bose AR devices. If no Bose AR device is available, The Worst Grim Reaper: Soul Mates is still fully playable with only your mobile phone. Look around with your Bose AR device or tap Sebastian, the moon and his lantern Lux to interact with the Grim Reaper.
