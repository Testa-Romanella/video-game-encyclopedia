I decided to incorporate this theme bu telling the story of a father lost and confused on parenting, going as far as not wanting to be a father.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0used this experience to create a dialogue system for myself. I'll be able to use this dialogue system in any future games now. I also worked a lot with Audacity and sound editing. This was my first time recording and editing audio.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:<br/></p>\n<p>Game, art,\u00a0 and story made by me.</p>\n<p>Music by Charteeguh on Soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/charteeguh?ref=clipboard).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:57:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d2/2d281db145a00d59dd9756c742ea26a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jteaaa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
