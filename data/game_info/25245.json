{"id": 25245, "slug": "art-of-fighting", "name": "ART OF FIGHTING", "name_original": "ART OF FIGHTING", "description": "<p>\n      This fighting game, released in 1992, began the story of the Sakazaki \n      family and Robert Garcia, further developed in two later sequels. Yuri \n      Sakazaki has been abducted by Mr. Big to punish her father, Takuma, and \n      her brother, Ryo. To rescue her, Ryo and Robert must take on numerous \n      enemies around South Town, eventually reaching the mysterious Mr. \n      Karate. The passion of the game\u2019s creators is evident in the unique game \n      play elements introduced. These include an energy gauge that is depleted \n      every time a fighter uses a special maneuver, Desperation Attacks that \n      are usable only when a fighter\u2019s health is low, and camera zooming that \n      adjusts on the fly as fighters move around the stage. All these features \n      ensure that players use strategy and tactics, rather than simply mash \n      buttons. Adding to the mix are little touches such as characters showing \n      cuts when they are injured and voice-over samples during cut scenes. Can \n      you perfect the art of fighting and save Yuri?\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. See more Virtual Console games for Wii.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6e/e6e9d61ac6228364608dbb5034249694.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["D4 Enterprise"], "esrb_rating": null}
