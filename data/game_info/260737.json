Grow crops and select which ones to use for the next generation. Earn money by selling your crops to the shop and buy new seeds from the\u00a0 trader's ever changing inventory.<br/><br/>Currently features 5 procedurally generated crop plants, a single save slot, a seed machine and your run of the mill tools to take care of your plants.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, that it is an early prototype, there are a few bugs/inconveniences right now. Selling seeds does not earn you money, and tomatoes never \"die\".<br/>You can report any bugs or put suggestions/feedback in the comments :D<br/></p>\n<p>In the future I want to add:<br/>Seed/Crop analyzer: shows you the traits of the Crop/seed, so you can decide about keeping or selling.</p>\n<p>Wilting: keeping your plants without water for too long will make them wilt.<br/></p>\n<p>Passive/active breeding: (might break the savegame, once it's added) splits the current crop data into two alleles per trait with recessive or dominant nature. Potentially agent driven,</p>\n<p>Magical crops: not quite fit for selling, but has other uses...</p>\n<p>Combat: fight a goal oriented AI that comes in multiple shapes (slimes, bugs, elementals etc.)</p>\n<p>Elemental system for combat as well as classic Rock-Paper-Scissors trinity of Ranged, Melee and Magical attacks.<br/><br/>(Procedurally generated) dungeons where you can mine for ore and gems as well as dig for higher quality soil.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD for 8 directional movement<br/>Scrolling up/down to select active tool<br/>F Interact with highlighted location/Object/Use tool<br/>I opens inventory<br/>moving items via drag and drop in the inventory, or inventory-like menus<br/>Ctrl + LMB to split stacks (the split stack will be marked and you then need to drag the split off stack to where you want it)<br/>Press Space to jump<br/>P will show you your FPS<br/></p>\n<p>Use the bedside table to save you game<br/>Interact with the bed to restock the shop<br/>For shop/seed machine, only the top 2 rows of UI are interactable.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0 Nicole Marie T (@musicvsartstuff) <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce73b296c445555e7bcbe2e0bb6f509a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zugai89"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
