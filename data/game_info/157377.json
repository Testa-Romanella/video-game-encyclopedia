Companies like Big Water are the only ones with enough power to mobilise water to the dry regions of the world. But at the same time, that means fresh water supplies are being dried up and water is being sold for unaffordable prices. You join a rebellion to deregulate the supplying of water that should be free for everyone.</p><p>On the way you'll fight robots and mafia minions using the exotic weapons supplied to you by the rebellion. You'll start out with a cricket bat which you'll need to err... defend yourself.</p><p>Local multiplayer: Getting revenge isn't easy, so get a wingman! Press <em>backspace </em>in the game to play with a friend. </p><p>If your wingman/wingwoman runs out of health, get behind cover and revive them!</p><p>And stay hydrated. Drink water to heal yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86f/86f61e83a3b1e7dd7bc6b4f148049d3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["plenopterix"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
