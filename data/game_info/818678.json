The theme was \"roll of the dice\".</p>\n<p>Move and select with A &amp; D, jump with space bar, use skill with 1.</p>\n<p>Your \"decisions\" on what class to play, skill to use and loot to pick up is made by a roll of your decision-die! You can equip new dice, enabling new decisions (like the second class)!<br/></p>\n<p>The decision-die persists through death, but your spell die will be lost.\u00a0Thats right - your spells also roll, and your spell die can also be changed.</p>\n<p>This is a roguelike game that features 2 classes, 4 usable skills,\u00a05 levels with \"unique\" bosses\u00a0and a total of 14 dice to discover!</p>\n<p>(The last level is where mobs fall from the sky, and you cant beat it - or can you?
