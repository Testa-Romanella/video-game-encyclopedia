Fighting monsters is not always the best choice,\u00a0and the resources are very poor, so you need to be careful with each step. The game\u00a0concept is inspired in games like Resident Evil 4 and Dead Space, the mechanics in the\u00a0genre Metroidvania like Hollow Knight and the style is inspired in the games of the console\u00a0PlayStation (the first one). Our intention with this project is create our first game concept,\u00a0focusing on the mechanics, the atmosphere and in the feeling of the player controlling a\u00a0heavy character in a hostile and unfair situation.</p>\n<p>The game is Windows only for the time.</p>\n<p>The shaders were obtained from github.\r\n</p>\n<p>We highly recommend checking it out and supporting the creator, this prototype wouldn't look this way if it weren't frome it.\r\n</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Kodrin/URP-PSX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T11:41:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd83f14a35213037845fef878f6ee18f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GaseousHat855"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
