Making Parties Matter introduces new mechanics that will allow more utility in adjudicating social encounters. What can the characters do to setup the roll for better results, and what kinds of results should they even expect? These new mechanics are detailed in the first chapter. The second chapter introduces fifteen party games that could be used as part of a game with or without these new mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T04:26:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/341/34135a66f4381df81be6241a955bd6f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Goatmeal Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
