{"id": 584421, "slug": "evil-egg", "name": "Evil Egg", "name_original": "Evil Egg", "description": "<p>This is a game I developed within 3 days for the Eggstravaganza Game Jam 2021. For this game jam I wanted to work on using Scriptable Objects more and work on manipulating time. Music was also designed and created specifically for this\u00a0 which by Rob Cook (who does not have an itch.io).</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>W - Move up<br/>S - Move down<br/>A - Move left<br/>D - Move right<br/>Mouse - Aims the characters weapons but does not change his movement<br/>F - Opens shop but only when you are close to it (Evil Egg is the shop)</p>\n<p>Objective:<br/>During the day you should gather wood by cutting trees and chocolate eggs to offer to the Eggronomicron. Night starts setting at 21:00, you need to defend the Egg and yourself when the evil bunnies start to spawn at midnight. Each day makes the waves harder and harder. You also need to watch your hunger bar so buy some egg whites to keep yourself sustained on that protein.</p>\n<p>Plot: <br/>You play as Chadley J. Williams. You are stuck in the woods with no where to go (unless you walk outside the world boundaries...) and stuck with a creepy looking egg bound in human flesh. <br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art<br/>Character - Matt Corben<br/>Weapons &amp; Bullets - Matt Corben<br/>Trees, Woods, Egg, Evil Egg - Matt Corben<br/>Cock UI - Matt Corben<br/>Environment - Adam Saltsman (https://adamatomic.itch.io/jawbreaker)<br/></p>\n<p>Coding<br/>A* Pathfinding - Aron Granberg (https://arongranberg.com/astar/)<br/>Everything Else - Matt Corben</p>\n<p>Sound<br/>Music - Rob Cook<br/></p>\n<p>Known Bugs:<br/>Shop doesn't work properly<br/>Reload sound on axe<br/>Can walk out of the level<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T04:08:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd0/dd05ac796765da054ba280d2b42d53a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MavTech"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
