Which is kinda poetic, in a way. I'm just really lazy.</p>\n<p>More of a prototype than anything. There are some bugs that I missed due to the razor-thin margin I gave myself with regards to the submission window. If you get a non-spawning bug after retrying just relaunch the game. Sorry about that. Quickly submitted a version with a minor fix that should remove that bug. Sorry about that.
