I'm going to be frequently updating this (at least once a week) with new content (I won't be updating it as much during August as I will be very busy then)\u00a0. I released it because I want to see what people think the game should have/should be. Should I make it level based? Or should I make it one giant level that takes a loooong time to beat. Maybe both and make it a bit like geometry dash?
