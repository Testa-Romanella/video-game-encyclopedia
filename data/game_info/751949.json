With cunning and dark stories (some even real - believe me!).</p>\n<p>In this game, you and your friends will come across the strangest riddles you&#39;ve ever seen.  To solve them, players will need to prove their skills as detectives.</p>\n<p>The stories are designed in a way that encourages players to think outside the box, analyzing facts in an abstract way.</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: THIS GAME MUST BE PLAYED IN A GROUP.  NOT RECOMMENDED FOR UNDER 12 YEARS.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY</p>\n<p>1 - A player chooses a case at random, reads the riddle and the solution to himself, transmitting only the case to the other players;</p>\n<p>2 - From there the other players start the questions, which can be asked in any order and by whoever wants to.  There is only one rule: players must formulate their questions in such a way that the person who knows the whole case can only answer \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d or \u201cirrelevant\u201d, when the answer will not help at all;</p>\n<p>3 - The questions, sooner or later, will lead players to discover the rest of the e-Nigma.  When the Storyteller considers that the story has been resolved satisfactorily, he can complete the game and read the complete solution.  It&#39;s up to the narrator to give some clues if the story is at an impasse.</p>\n<p>NOTE: The answer of the solution does not have to be given literally.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-10T14:11:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/599/5992dff96a6c555a8891049c88f7aad1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
