Snow My Gosh is inspired by old school car games like\u00a0Pole Position\u00a0and\u00a0Night Driver\u00a0as well as minimalist winter games like Vlambeer's\u00a0Yeti Hunter\u00a0and Bob Whitehead's\u00a0Skiing. I also manage to bring up Yeti and/or Bigfoot in conversation about once a week so I figured it was time to stick a Yeti-like creature in a game. This was also a great chance to build a 3D game that uses a camera perspective that I haven't worked with. After using an isometric perspective in\u00a0Smash Captains, I wanted to try my hand at making a game that required a different 3D camera orientation.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY<br/></strong>Use the left and right arrows to change lanes.
