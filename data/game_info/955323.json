Skill won't be enough. Build your courage, believe in yourself, and you can reach your goals!</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The player must reach the bottom by collecting Shrimp. Both shrimp propel the player down further, the special yellow shrimp refilling the shrew\u2019s stamina.</li><li>The player must avoid Urchins and Fish or else they\u2019ll lose health or, even worse, lives. Health and lives can be purchased as part of the upgrades.</li><li>The game has a trick system where the more tricks, the more DNA coins are worth. These coins can be used to upgrade Shrew in the middle of a run. The total amount can be used between runs to permanently upgrade Shrew unless, unless they die.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T14:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e5/9e5b22940e4871186ad4565d6035a53f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["PLAY-MEK"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
