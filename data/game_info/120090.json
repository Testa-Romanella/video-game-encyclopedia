In the USA, Olson Corporation is leading the scientific researches to create new materials and electronic devices with less components. After 10 years of development, doctor Matt Olson, the director of the company and one of the most famous physicists of the world have created a new material that will revolutionize the whole technological industry. This invention is called Infinitum, a mix of graphene and an advanced AI it's capable to transform into different shapes and change his own properties. However, Doctor Olson made a huge mistake, his own creation was conscious and able to understand his existence. The first day that Olson Corp team switched on Infinitum, it run away to reach freedom. </p><p>Music: Eric Skiff<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/875/8758efda4563628a61c436c615f9371d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["jyeray"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
