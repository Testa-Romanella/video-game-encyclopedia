The idea is to master each part of the level and obtain the fastest time as well as completing a level in under a certain number of deaths. It may look easy but prepare to die (and possibly smash your keyboard) many times over.</p>\n<p>Feedback received from the game will be put towards another (hopefully better)\u00a0project which is planned to be 2.5D made with the Unreal Engine.</p>\n<p>There may be minor bugs in the game, they are being resolved and this is not an abandoned project by any means in its current form. If you spot something (other than a terrible game) please get in touch!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong></p>\n<p>This game is immature and does have minor bad language and adult themes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Navigation in Menu - Arrows and\u00a0Space Bar</p>\n<p><strong>In game</strong></p>\n<p>Movement - Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Double Jump/Jump - Space Bar</p>\n<p>Fire poop - V</p>\n<p>Roll - Press Down</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T07:01:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f8421886ba93fac7434cc233c086246f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DrIvingGame"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
