Click on one of the ball holders to pick up the ball on top, and click on another holder to place it down on the holder. You win if every holder is either empty, or full with balls of the same color, though it won't tell you that\u00a0you won when you do win. This is the first game I have ever uploaded on the internet, so I hope its good. I only have a windows version. Edit: I now have a mac version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T07:59:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20d/20da5e619c01bbeb0445c8cfeba91f71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Firefighter_M"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
