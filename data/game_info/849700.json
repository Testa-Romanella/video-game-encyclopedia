The purpose of the project is to serve an educational purpose in improving my skills with unreal. Despite being aware of a few bugs and the fact that it can really use a better coat of paint (especially in the UI department),\u00a0I'm not considering any updates for this project for the time being as it has already served its purpose. Thus,\u00a0it may never be revisited.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T06:38:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4e/f4e52aa8aba754ff7f6eb356d273a33e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Movsac"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
