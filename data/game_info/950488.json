With a cube-like aesthetic, you'll feel right at home as you delve into the intricacies of processors.</p><p>Whether you're a seasoned circuit designer or a complete beginner, CMOS Crafter offers something for everyone.\u00a0To build your circuits, you'll have access to various blocks, such as traces, positive and negative terminals, clocks, and both pMOS and nMOS transistors.<br/></p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Challenges<br/></strong>You'll be challenged to design circuits that fulfill fundamental structures like inverters, logic gates, and bit adders while gaining a deeper understanding of how processors work and operate.\u00a0\u00a0A sandbox mode allows players to test their custom creations.</p><p><strong>Sandbox</strong><br/>With our sandbox mode, you can test out your own designs and see how they perform in real-time.</p>\n<p>Mechanics to master</p><ul><li><strong>Space:</strong>\u00a0Players must manage available space on their die as they design and build their processors. This adds an extra layer of challenge, as players will need to carefully consider the size and layout of their components to make the most efficient use of the available space.</li><li><strong>Signal propagation delay:</strong>\u00a0Additionally, players will need to handle signal propagation delay, which is a critical factor in the operation of any real-world processor. By carefully designing and placing their components, players can minimize signal propagation delay and optimize performance.</li><li><strong>Power supply:</strong>\u00a0As you design your circuits, you must carefully manage your power supply circuitry to provide power and ensure optimal performance.</li></ul><p>These features add depth and complexity to the gameplay experience, challenging players to think creatively and strategically as they explore the world of processor circuit design.</p>\n<p><strong>Early prototype!<br/></strong>We've created this game as a prototype and are eager to gather feedback from players like you. Try it out, and let us know what you think! With your help, we can continue to refine and develop CMOS Crafter into the ultimate circuit design game.</p><ul><li>Here in the comments section!</li><li>Prototype 1 - Feedback Survey\u00a0</li><li>Discord</li></ul><p><strong>Download now and start crafting!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T14:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a64/a64923575c10fbe84b56c3883d196dcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elort"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
