The process caused damage to your body and the incinerator is lowering you to your doom.\u00a0Your only hope of survival is to repair your broken system with scraps from other robots while avoiding the fiery depths of the incinerator. Repairing yourself should trick the incinerator system into stopping.\u00a0 So\u00a0jump, repair and survive!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game was made at GGJ 2020 and worked on for a month in my spare time after work. I plan on starting to work on my next game and release it later this year. This is officially my first full release of a game. Even if it's a simple game I learned a lot working on this game. If you enjoy this game at all please consider following me at one of my social sites. That would mean a lot to me and you'll get to see my progress on my next game.
