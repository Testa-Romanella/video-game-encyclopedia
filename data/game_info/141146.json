{"id": 141146, "slug": "eist-returns", "name": "Eist returns", "name_original": "Eist returns", "description": "<p>Eist returns is an arcade-puzzle game first written in 1992 for 8-bit Atari computers. In 2016 it was given the second life on\u00a0Android devices. Now Eist returns once again as an open source project for desktop computers. Feel free to download, play, and contribute to the\u00a0project on GitHub.<br/></p>\n<p>Carry Eist through 40 boards, placing arrows on his way to indicate directions. Descent from the path will make him fall down. You need to pick up all artifacts for the exit to open. Along the way you will encounter doors: you need a key to open each one. Use the ladder to cross gaps in the path. It can only be set in designated places. Touch the ladder to pick it up and set it where you need. On some boards you will also find a pair of teleports: they move Eist to each another. Remember: the movement direction stays the same.</p>\n<p>Before you click the board and put Eist in movement, plan the game carefully. You will have no time to think later.</p>\n<p>Log in to the Hall of Fame to sync the game state between devices,\u00a0and compare your results to other players on the game website. <em>Note: the Android version uses the Play Games services, and does not store results to the Hall of Fame. It's also not yet open-sourced.</em></p>\n<p>For more instructions on how to play, please check out\u00a0Wiki pages. You'll also find some info on the Level editor there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9d/b9d423e23f3ab2cd486fd3c735becf4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["nwg"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
