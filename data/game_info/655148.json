This makes the game essentially unplayable past day three in the game-jam ready version.</p>\n<p>This game is a project of love -- I'd rather you didn't rate the game at all and play the best version than only play the version with three levels and rate it.</p>\n<p>God has thrown an absolute rager in Heaven to celebrate His seven days of creation. As the new production line undermanager of Heaven Industries, you begin receiving some very strange work orders for new creations on The Eighth Day. You must fill out these work orders with increasing urgency by slapping different body parts and modifications on these horrific creations using your divine operating surface (DOS), all while learning on the job from your very own Employee Manual and preventing Satan from meddling with production efforts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:02:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/721/721aec120337fa21425bd2c87019e115.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["noneme"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
