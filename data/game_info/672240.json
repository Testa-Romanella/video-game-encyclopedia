This is my first attempt at making a game and all visual and audio assets and code were created within 2 weeks for the 32bit Game Jam 2021. After the conclusion of the jam, I will be updating the game with additional features which were cut for time, including more levels and combat. I hope this game will become the base for a larger game in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you to Dr. Elizabeth Hambleton for supplying the voice of the bee.</p>\n<p>Controller recommended, keyboard supported.</p>\n\n<p>Controls (Keyboard or [Xbox/Switch/PS controller]):</p>\n<p>Run: WASD or left stick</p>\n<p>Walk: hold shift or left trigger</p>\n<p>Camera: mouse or right stick</p>\n<p>Hover: Space orY/X/Triangle or A/B/Cross</p>\n<p>Dodge: RMB or B/A/Circle</p>\n<p>Attack: LMB or X/Y/Square</p>\n<p>Unlock mouse cursor: Escape or Start</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-16T07:09:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab04c2a89b5e84c0661b320263bd7f45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicrotonalMatt"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
