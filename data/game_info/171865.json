He died in 2012 before finishing one of his stories, one that starred Hailey and trapped her in a video game. I made this game in his memory, working on it here and there for the last four years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's an uncommon bug where a cutscene gets stuck at the end rather than begin the next level, but you can refresh any scene by pressing V and that always solves the problem.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Also includes a download for MrDrake's original short story. Walkthrough for this game is\u00a0here.\u00a0Special thanks to @SydMeeker for creating the soundtrack!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3b/d3bba37026b1be5a9a12f24a0828a404.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aabicus"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
