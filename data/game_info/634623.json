Done during JGDGJ. Use your claw to bring treasures back to the hangar. Use radar to navigate through the underwater caverns. Red pin points to the treasure and green points to the hangar. But be careful your radar battery runs out pretty quickly. Gather more battery from dead sharks. If you lose your treasure you can go back to hangar without it.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: WASD</p>\n<p>Lift/Drop claw: Up and Down arrows</p>\n<p>Open claw: Left arrow</p>\n<p>Close claw: Right arrow</p>\n<p>Gun: Space</p>\n<p>Missile: Left shift</p>\n<p>Toggle Radar: E</p>\n<p>Mute: M</p>\n<p>Quit: ESC</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T07:41:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/498/4982080b425118e4a4b35aabae980407.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["kovalok"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
