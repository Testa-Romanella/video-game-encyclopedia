Prepare for hell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Come play in a colorful mansion filled with happy surprises, including spiked cheese traps, murderous unicorns, and arrows of demise and love.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b06a93703ceae7947ed344a132895394.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NotFastButFurious"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
