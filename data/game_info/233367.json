Choose your moves carefully as it is not always an advantage to use them. <br/><br/>If you would like to get 3 stars and reach a higher score you will have to collect all three of them, before the diamonds reach the castle.<br/><br/>\u2605\u2605\u2605 Features: \u2605\u2605\u2605<br/>\u2714 High quality 3D graphics<br/>\u2714 Many puzzles for you to enjoy <br/>\u2714 Challenging physics game play<br/>\u2714 Many levels to be played<br/>\u2714 Background music and sounds<br/> <br/>This is a free application.
