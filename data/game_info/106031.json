For this demo I created a UI interface to allow control of the generation parameters. Be warned - the algorithm is still a work in progress and consequently some parameters may have no effect (though I tried to remove anything redundant) and some may cause very strange behaviour!</p>\n<p>\u00a0The style is inspired by vintage sci-fi artwork and Dr Seuss illustrations. Planning to improve on it for the duration of the jam.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the control panel on the right to change the tree generation parameters.</li><li>A seed can be entered in the top text box or random seeds can be generated.</li><li>The Live Update option refreshes the mesh whenever a parameter is changed.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Camera Movement</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Click-Drag to orbit and zoom</li><li>Scroll mouse to adjust camera height</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Demo can be played in the browser or downloaded for Windows or Mac</li><li>Windows/Mac downloads: simply download and extract the zip file, then run the .exe file (Windows) or .app file (Mac).</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Details</strong></p>\n<p>Everything is procedural.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tree branches are generated using a recursive algorithm, which uses Unity's Mesh class to build the geometry vertex by vertex, polygon by polygon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tree texture is generated using layers of algorithmic patterns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The leaves are flat polygons with a cutout shader applied. Bezier curves with random control point positions are used to generate the leaf textures.</p>\n<p>The terrain is also generated procedurally. This implementation uses Perlin Noise for that smooth rolling hill effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/134/1340798ba06ec5ae7fdc0788dfca0227.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["rednax"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
