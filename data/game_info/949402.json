That's it.</p>\n<p>You have to be quick, precise and focused, otherwise</p>\n<p>your guitar might sound terrible.</p>\n<p>Learning how to predict the next note will give you additional points.</p>\n<p>Keep track of your high score PRs!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>Move mouse to aim at notes (colored depending on pitch)</p>\n<p>Left click or tap space while aiming at a note to play it.</p>\n<p>Ctrl+Enter to reset</p>\n<p>P or ESC to open song library</p>\n<p>P or ESC again to close song library</p>\n<p>Up/Down arrows or mouse to navigate through the library</p>\n<p>Left click or Enter to select a song from the library</p>\n\n<p><strong>Library</strong></p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>The game can load music represented by a 24 bit BMP.</p>\n<p>Yes, you can draw it in paint, but the BMP must be exactly 200x200px</p>\n<p>the hue defines the pitch, the saturation defines the velocity</p>\n<p>and the value defines the octave (currently 3 octaves are supported,</p>\n<p>+1 and -1 from middle C octave).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can load a MIDI (.mid) file.</p>\n<p>The mid parser I use is kinda bugy so it might not work for just about</p>\n<p>all .mids but it works fine, if exported through FL Studio.</p>\n<p>To load a sound, write it down on a new line in library.txt</p>\n<p>The extension is optional. (24 bit 200x200 .bmp supported</p>\n<p>and some .mid) AFAIR, you can load up to 8 songs or something.</p>\n<p>I wanted to keep it simple. And be gentle with the poor game engine.</p>\n<p>How do I know I am good at this?</p>\n<p>--------------------------------</p>\n<p>Check pro.txt for insights</p>\n<p><strong>To-Do</strong></p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Maybe if some good fella is able to financially help us in our endeavours,</p>\n<p>we can purchase a musescore subscription and obtain much more pieces to</p>\n<p>include in the game as presets. If you are that person I would</p>\n<p>rather recommend you to invest in our other more serious projects,</p>\n<p>but if you for some reason like this one, we'll take it.</p>\n<p>A difficulty system might also be a good idea for some future update.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T16:28:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa8/fa83d7cb6a089d0d91511c27c8007466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game-Editor 2"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
