However, drama usually has to be instigated, and before she knows it, Mimi soon finds herself meddling in their personal matters in order to get more ideas for her story.</p>\n<p>But can anyone blame her, really?<em> It's for the sake of her art!</em><br/></p>\n<em>Through the Panels</em> is a comedy/slice-of-life visual novel <strong>currently in development</strong>.\r\n<p> This demo contains the beginning of the game, and provides an introduction to all the main pursuable characters.
