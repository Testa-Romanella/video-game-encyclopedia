Two competitors smash\u00a0painted eggs together. The victor receives the loser's broken egg. Victory mainly depends on the angle of attack and where you manage to hit the other person's egg. This game tries to faithfully replicate the complicated tactics of Eierpecken.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a local two-player game, currently for desktop browsers only.
