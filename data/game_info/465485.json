Deer can pick up and throw water bombs, beavers can chop down trees to create bridges (Or smother fires), and rabbits can leap large distances and kick any water bombs in their path. You'll need to use all of their abilities (And your ability to float)\u00a0to push back the fire until the next season begins. If the fire spreads too much or ignites the cute fox stump, it's game over!</p>\r\nControls<p>Click \"Start Game\" with the mouse or select with your standard selection button\u00a0on your gamepad.</p>\n\r\nKeyboard and Mouse\r\n\r\nController\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Created by Sydney H and\u00a0Calvin\u00a0E.</p>\n<p>Art by Sydney H.</p>\n<p>Icons by Calvin E.</p>\n<p>Sound effects from YouTube Audio Library.</p>\n<p>Music provide by the following.</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Midnight Tale by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4710-midnight-tale</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Professor Umlaut by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4243-professor-umlaut</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:02:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb0e4cc8f2c5c3e04f555a992f769082.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Calvin And Hobbies"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
