He has an extremely serious and dramatic view of the world which actually makes him appear more cartoonish and silly in comparison to the \u201cnormal\u201d NPCs.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our core mechanics are centred around exploration and investigation. The \u201chub and spoke\u201d structure of our game and semi-linear story structure affords the player more freedom and choice in how to approach the mystery (e.g. where to go first, who to talk to, what objects to look at).\r\n</p>\n<p>We are using a minimalistic, primarily monochromatic colour scheme to evoke a dark noir aesthetic. Colour will be used deliberately and in restraint as a visual cue to draw the player\u2019s attention to key objects, interaction points, clues, or other such elements. Moreover, the characters are all anthropomorphic animals which are drawn in a cutesy cartoon art style. This design emphasizes the light-hearted and fantastical undertones of our story. The stark visual contrast is meant to create curiosity.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our music will reference soundtracks of classic noir films, with the use of string instruments (cello, bass, violin), piano, and realistic drums. It will borrow from jazz and combine old styles with classic video game 8-bit music to generate a modern style fitting a pixel game. The atmosphere will shift from suspenseful to quirky and fun as our player character interacts with different NPCs and explores different areas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T19:25:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f2/3f2ed860bb62d8a858217d20c85e2a15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Silin Song"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
