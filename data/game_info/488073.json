I will try fixing bugs here and there, but I will mainly be updating the downloadable version.\u00a0Feel free to comment if you've encountered any errors, have any suggestions or questions or just wanna say hi.\u00a0</p>\r\nCreator's Experience:\r\n<p>In my previous game jams, I've noticed that the most crucial thing I'm missing is the strange, strange feeling called... \"fun\".\u00a0What seemed like such a trivial and simple thing... turned out to be my downfall...so I promised to myself that the main priority will be FUN.\u00a0Anyway, the first thing I thought of when I found out the \"HURL\" theme was cats.\u00a0 I\u00a0don't have a cat myself tho so I had to search some info online along with some sfx (I literally searched \"cat spit sound free\"). BUT, the most important thing is that I'm satisfied with what I have created and that it will haunt me in my dreams.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T03:03:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/586/58685d31d57239aa68c65f1bb220442c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["glas"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
