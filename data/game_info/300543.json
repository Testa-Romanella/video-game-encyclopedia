It presents you MTB School which consists of\u00a0nine lessons. Each of them can be passed on satisfactory, good or excellent mark.\u00a0The key feature of this simulator is maximally true physics including suspension working, balance maintain, interaction with the trail and aerodynamic.</p>\n<p>Longer video of riding:</p>\n<p>Video about suspension in the\u00a0game:\u00a0</p>\n<p>To enjoy playing MTB Game Demo your computer should meet following requirement:<br/></p><p>1. Operating system \u2013 Windows XP or newer<br/></p>\n<p>2. Processor \u2013 Intel i5 or better</p>\n<p>3. GPU \u2013 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 or better</p>\n<p>4. RAM \u2013 2 GB or more</p>\n<p>5. Joystick or joypad</p>\n<p>This game is simulator, so joystick is what you must have to enjoy playing. However, technically, all controls could be assigned to keyboard and mouse with pressed right button will control turn and move forward/backward channel. So, at least you may pass first two lessons without joystick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0To change graphical settings you can edit \u201cgraphic_settings.txt\u201d file from the game folder (all parameters are well described there). I am not sure about all settings that will be present in full version, so I didn\u2019t put them to the game menu.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It is the first release, so errors and launch problems are expectable. You can help me to solve them be providing a problem description with \"shaders_log.bin\" file (will appear in the application folder) to the following address:\u00a0 \u00a0MTBGameDemo2019@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Game website:\u00a0https://www.mtbsimulator.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:58:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/321/3212e81dd05e6648a6ca0b62fcf4f543.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aleksandr_NK"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
