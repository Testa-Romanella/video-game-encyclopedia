However, their latest foray into energy exploration on Planet X13, has placed them into a bit of a pickle. The Swarmers, the native insectoid species, have another idea - to eat all the workers!<br/><br/><strong>The Perfect Swarm</strong><br/>You take control of the Swarmers, a highly aggressive insectoid species, who must convert human flesh into alien muscle, upgrade their units and even find the time to gatecrash a birthday party.<br/><br/>To put a stop to the invasion, the Swarmers must plan attacks carefully. Take control of unsuspecting workers, set traps, emerge from vents and hiding spots to take your human prey by surprise, and assault in groups to kill multiple enemies at once. <br/><br/><strong>It\u2019s meat Jim, but not as we know it</strong><br/>The more earthlings killed, the more corpses can be consumed and transformed into new units with specialized roles and unique abilities. The flesh of their own workers is the key ingredient to developing a successful alien insurgency against Galactoil. <br/> <br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de1/de1438d25136b7aa8e3463d65cef8c93.jpg", "website": "http://teamjunkfish.com/game/attack-of-the-earthlings/", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 138, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 65, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Linux", "macOS", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Wales Interactive", "Team Junkfish"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Junkfish"], "esrb_rating": null}
