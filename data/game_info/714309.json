It is intended to make the story more accessible to the English speaking audience, as well as improve upon the text and translations. Additionally, it is meant to encourage players to support the game by players through the game's stages on the Japanese servers.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a part of Project: Rebirth, the initiative to make GGZ as a game and as a story more accessible for the global audience.\r\n</p>\n<p>This project contains assets and music owned by miHoYo. We are building it under the assumption that it will benefit miHoYo's work, and the assumption that translation of unlocalised work is generally appreciated.\r\n</p>\n<p>If miHoYo, at any point and for any reason, decides they do not wish to allow this project to continue, we WILL take it down.</p>\n<p>Guns GirlZ official Japanese website<br/></p>\n<p>Hoyostans page for Guns GirlZ</p>\n<p>If you want to support the project, you can support Mister Spaceman, who is building the app, directly through the support button above.
