Get creative with where you place them they are very sticky<br/></p><p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/>WASD to move<br/></p><p>Left click to place pylons<br/>Right click to remove pylons</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/>Art: Murten101</p>\n<p>Code: Murten101</p>\n<p>Sound: Jabberwocky / Murten101</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS:</strong><br/>Removing pylons can cause pylons that should be powered to loose power. This can be fixed by picking up these pylons and placing them back down.<br/> i didn't have time to fix the sector scanning algorithm :(\u00a0</p><p>you slide of the platform when it moves so you will have to move along with it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ca/2cad85b0ab0ea2ae5129149fc771b8ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["murten101"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
