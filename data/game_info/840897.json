And they can be rotated.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>50+ pixel pictures of various sizes and themes (people, animals, fruits, things, devices, etc.).<br/></li><li>Each of the pictures has 6 game variations - that is, with different sets of blocks and different complexity. Thus, there are 300+ levels in the game.<br/></li><li>The \"Mosaic Easy\" difficulty mode is an ordinary 2D mosaic, even a child can solve it. This cannot be said for all other modes. The most difficult one is \"3D Hard\", which has a high combinatoriness and a hard shortage of blocks. This poses a serious intellectual challenge (but all levels in the game are guaranteed to be passable).<br/></li><li>The game is non-linear! Many levels have many correct solutions (block stacking sequences), and not just one, conceived by the author of the game.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T05:41:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8b/e8b71f0098ac011c64a0f988a7b3e364.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VirtexUniverse"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["VirtexUniverse"], "esrb_rating": null}
