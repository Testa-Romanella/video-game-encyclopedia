Currently, the project is at the Alpha stage. Our goal is to create an enjoyable and playable demo that users can experience! We hope to construct it into a complete game. Players will be able to explore a large terrain called Primordium (and soon will be able to travel to other available islands in future updates).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Inspired by great role-playing games</strong><br/><br/>The Aevumblade Chronicles is our take on an Action role-playing game. The main goal is to make the gameplay fun and accompany it with an interesting and amazing story. This demo offers up to 5 characters to play.  We took inspiration on existing franchises and implemented some ideas we thought would result in a fun and unique experience! Give it a try and tell us what you think!
