No, really\u2026 how fast???<br/><br/>It's a fiendishly clever game, that's too simple and too easy and too hard and too fun. But what does it all mean\u2026 when you're a cat?<br/><br/>Well, just start tapping and watch the money pile up. Hundreds, then thousands, then millions, then billions, then kili-billies, mega-billies, and beyond. But to get that much you'll have to make some wise investments! Stock it all in your shoe box!<br/><br/>Maybe you'll invest in venture capital, catnip factory, or dogecoins.<br/><br/>Maybe you'll start licking humans for money or a casino or a cat college.<br/><br/>Or maybe you'll buy off a federal judge and watch the dollars roll in!<br/><br/>Or maaaaybe the ferocious Dog Police will show up on your doorstep and grab your cash. You better be careful\u2026 or just be ready with a bribe.<br/><br/>So tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap your way to glory.<br/><br/>Is it a stupid game? Or are you just falling behind your friends and looking for excuses?<br/><br/>Oh, and don't forget to buy that bucket. Even someone as vibrant and dashing as you can't keep tapping forever\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:03:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d04/d04acfe97aa0f36cf5b5957da470d37d.jpg", "website": "http://www.texaspfcg.com/app?bundleId=com.cronus.hackaton201505.group10.project01", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Texas PFCG Aplicativos Ltda"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Texas PFCG Aplicativos Ltda"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
