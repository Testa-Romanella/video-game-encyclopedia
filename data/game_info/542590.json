{"id": 542590, "slug": "revenger", "name": "Revenger", "name_original": "Revenger", "description": "\"A fast-paced, tough as nails first-person shooter evocative of the direct-to-video action flicks of the 1980\u2019s, Revenger is a short, but memorable experience about one man\u2019s hunt to rescue his daughter, and kill everyone responsible for her kidnapping.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInfluenced by a variety of modern games, Revenger is a small-scale UE4 project that acts as the debut release from one-man studio Trillix34. Work your way through a series of varied, large environments, taking out every enemy that dares to get in between you and your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRevenger is a shooter at its core, but also carves itself into the genre slightly differently with the main weapon - the Axe. Use this to chop, hack and lob at your enemies like a bladed boomerang. Also available to you is an array of ranged weaponry, from 12-gauge shotguns to sniper rifles that decimate your foes, you\u2019ll surely find something here worth loving.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features a checkpoint mechanic to keep you engaged in the action, and you won\u2019t be traipsing through the large maps looking for enemies for long as they are chock-full of bad guys for you to put down. As you fight your way through the campaign, you\u2019ll hear your character make badass quips, reminiscent of games such as Duke Nukem and Rogue Warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDo you have what it takes to rescue your daughter, and slaughter her kidnappers? Find out now.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T02:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bed/bed79775f485bebab0342292e7dd7a17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trilix34"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Trilix34"], "esrb_rating": null}
