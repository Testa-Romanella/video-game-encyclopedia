Mouse to shoot.</p>\n\n<p>The year is 2050.<br/></p>\n<p>Humanity, after years of ever growing tensions and conflicts, finally snapped.</p>\n<p>All diplomatic attempts to fix anything always ends with bullets being fired, tanks ravaging the area, and the people suffering.</p>\n<p>And nowhere does that conflict rage harder than a city called Nowhere, in a country called Kool.</p>\n<p>Caught in the middle of the deadly conflict, the city finds itself under regular attack from all sides. Kool has attempted to remain completely neutral in all affairs regarding the war, but this has only made them a target to other nations, trying to \u2018convince\u2019 them to join.</p>\n<p>Brutal fighting in the streets, air raids, and even tanks plowing down public places have become a daily occurrence. The people of Nowhere are desperate, looking for any way to stop the fighting.</p>\n<p>In a final, desperate act, the government of Kool has managed to secure a single tank and a few aircraft to hold off the enemy. Intel has suggested that Nowhere is the final straw. If Nowhere falls, Kool will as well. If Nowhere still stands, the world will finally leave them in peace.</p>\n<p>They know the odds are heavily stacked against them.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s the only chance they have before the world\u2019s armies obliterate them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a final, desperate fight against all who come.</p>\n<p>Stand your ground.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T08:46:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e6/7e6207e78aea7a2504e653005207ebe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Webster Game Design"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
