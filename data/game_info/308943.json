You awaken in a world a with a whole lot of questions and not a whole lot of answers.</strong>\n<strong>Make strange friends... Uncover secrets... Gather... eyedrops?</strong>\n<strong>Something tells me we're gonna be just as confused when we're done here. Maybe even more so...</strong>\n<p>Ghost Story is a story driven action RPG currently being developed by me as a solo project! I'm still very much a beginner at game-making but doing this project has taught me\u00a0 a lot and I'm excited to learn even more as I continue.\u00a0It's still pretty early into development but I have completed this demo of the\u00a0prologue chapter for people to enjoy. :^)</p>\n<p>This demo is playable with keyboard or xinput devices, and is available on the following platforms:</p>\n<ul><li>Windows</li><li>macOS (COMING AT A LATER TIME CUZ IM BROKE IM SORRY ;n;)</li><li>Ubuntu*</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Caution:</strong>\u00a0There are a few scenes that those who are\u00a0photosensitive\u00a0should be aware of: (bright flashing lights, rapidly changing colors). However, there is an in-game option to dampen these effects. The game will ask you early on if you are sensitive to such things. (I'd also recommend answering yes to this question if you are streaming the game or recording video for a lot of people to see.)</p>\n<p>Note: Configurable controls are only available for keyboard users at this time. Gamepad configuration is planned, though.</p>\n<p>*During testing, there have been some strange graphical anomalies regarding a shader used during some parts of the game on the Ubuntu target. I'm currently looking into how to fix this, but in the mean time the game is still playable.</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS: \u2728</p>\n<p>Jonny Andino - Programming, Story, Music, Overworld sprites and backgrounds.
