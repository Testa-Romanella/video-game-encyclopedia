Kane is a satirical short form (2-3 hours) turn-based RPG that streamlines the genre to its basics; fighting monsters, talking to people, playing dress up. Dungeons are minimalist, graphics are monochrome. Random battles are no more, bosses are numerous. A Shark guides the way. An original hip hop soundtrack provides the beats.\r\n</p>\n<p>For years, video games have been moving further and further away from \"toys\" and more towards their one true goal: To Be Art. With C. Kane, the dream of a thousand indie game designers has finally been fulfilled. Critics have asked when games would get their own Citizen Kane; we have answered their question. The answer is right now, in this game whose description you are reading.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Contains rude language, mild monochrome blood, and ugly monsters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T03:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfb/bfb4a68d519b21fd57d0cc0fefaa2e2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Super Walrus Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
