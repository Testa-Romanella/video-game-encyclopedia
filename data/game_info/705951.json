(some even remove stats from your character.)</p>\n<p>curses, alot of curses, not the swearing kind.</p>\n<p>the ability to make your own magic types! no set magic types*, you make your own!<br/>*there are technically set types but thats because a few races get specific magic types.</p>\n<p>lore, kinda, it's not very good.</p>\n<p>all written in rtf (rich text documents) for your editing and homebrewing convenience! (i couldn't figure out how to make a pdf)</p>\n<p>and, a singular image,\u00a0art is expensive and hard to make.</p>\n<p>is this the best system? probably not. is it a system that'll probably lead to insane stories and campaigns? that's it's intended purpose at very least!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:49:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/398/398af49b46115a716a0aa61ca70bf105.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["forsaken_fox"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
