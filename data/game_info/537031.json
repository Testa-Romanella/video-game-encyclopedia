My name is Felipe Verri and im a 12 year old game developer, it has been a fun journey so far</p>\n<p>I started making this game a long time ago, i leaved it for a long time\u00a0because the project was to big for me at the time. I saw the project and i want to continue it, it can be a really cool game.</p>\n<p>This game is just started, there are a lot of things to do to finish it. Thanks you for playing it, and if you can share it!, it will help me out a lot. You can check down here to see how it continues. You can expect the next version in 1\u00a0month\u00a0 if nothing goes wrong.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Here is how the game will continue:</p>\n<p>1)I will need to start making money, i have a plan wich on 7 or 13 days it will become a constant source of money</p>\n<p>2)I will start taking an 2d animation course as i develop the game, the character will have proper animations</p>\n<p>3)It will have an engine update, godot is really painful to use on large projects like this, i will use unity for the next update(and probably for the rest of the updates)</p>\n<p>4)Before i start making any levels or coding, i will create 2 or 3 different game stories and i will choose the best one</p>\n<p>5)after all the preparations, i will start creating the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T02:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f2/0f2c1f0590b484567c8a61f3589a6fb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["argenPipe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
