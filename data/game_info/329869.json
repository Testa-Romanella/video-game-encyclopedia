Player bring Oog home?</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>This game was made to practice Bruce's 2D abilities, as well as to create a more traditional game with platforms and levels. Unfortunately, 3 hours wasn't that much time to create all that content, but it is still a platformer with levels. About an hour or more was spent just trying to fix the jumping - 2D is weird. At least the soundtrack is a bop!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T03:56:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05a/05a3c92af95cb608f93ee0bfd929db30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Helmersoft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
