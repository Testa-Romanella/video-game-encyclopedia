It's kind of hard to do that when everyone evacuates the dungeon where you died and sprinkles lines of salt everywhere that you can't cross. You really want to do some haunting, but instead you're stuck flailing wooden boards around and completing vague physics-based puzzles! But hey, at least this whole experience\u00a0makes your vengeful oaths that much stronger.</p><p>Making this little game taught me a lot about Unreal, and I'm glad I kept chipping at it even when it got frustrating. It was hard, but I feel like I'm better prepared than ever to make more games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T02:54:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03c85c3100d95b7b4c1d0612a061ddf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["willowsword"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
