But still in need of optimization and content. Also there is a dungeon map-generator, but it's unfinished and not integrated.<br/><strong> Graphics will be changed and balance will be updated. Plenty of dialogs, events, tasks, items and objects are gonna be added.<br/>Have in plans to add co-op up to 4 players and map-creation tools.</strong><br/>Since it's my pesonal project - I can change/add/delete any part of it if I see fit.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T06:43:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/276/2767b0a1d01b44766497f5a094648e4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["svyatys"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["svyatys"], "esrb_rating": null}
