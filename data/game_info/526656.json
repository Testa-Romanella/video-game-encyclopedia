Welcome to Moon Racer, the first game by Team L33&amp; Gameworx.</p>\n<p>Moon\r\nRacers is a 2D end-to-end race featuring 4 astronauts who, minding their own\r\nbusiness, have their card game rudely interrupted by an asteroid shower which\r\ntakes out almost all their Space Rockets. Only one has survived and only one\r\nastronaut can leave the moon, will it be you?</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\nD - Forward\r\nA - Backwards</p>\n<p>Who\r\nare Team L337 Gameworx?</p>\n<p>\r\nWe are three friends studying at West College Scotland, Silviu, Ryan, and\r\nmyself Will, we have\u00a0 never met face to face due to the pandemic but\r\ndecided regardless to\u00a0 team up and participate in the game jam together\r\nand use our common skills and knowledge gained from our (at the time of\r\nwriting) 2 months at college to create a game.</p>\n<p>We\r\nview this project as a learning experience, putting our collective knowledge to\r\nthe test, pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones and working on our\r\nteamwork, time and project management and most importantly learning to use what\r\nwe know outside of a college setting, deciding for ourselves what needed done\r\nand how/when we wanted to do it.\r\nWill (check out his itch page for this and future projects)</p>\n<p>https://twistdrabbit.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Silviu\r\n(check out his itch page for this and future projects)\r\nhttps://noelstudios.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Ryan\r\n(check out his itch page for this and future projects)\r\nhttps://thatguyflux.itch.io/</p>\n<p>We\r\nwere very excited about the project and even though we had to juggle\r\nassessments, college work and everyday life we are very proud of what we were\r\nable to build given our limited skillsets.</p>\n<p>We\r\ncertainly had a lot of amazing ideas that we would have liked to add to the\r\ngame but unfortunately, due to our limited skillset, we could not implement\r\nthem all.\u00a0 We decided to leave some of our more adventures ideas for\r\nfuture updates when we have gained a wider knowledge of the software, we are\r\nusing so keep an eye out for those coming.</p>\n<p>Will\r\nThe game is made using Unity 2D and Visual Editor using Art created by Myself\r\nin Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
