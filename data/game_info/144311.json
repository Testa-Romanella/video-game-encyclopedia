We set ourselves up well with scope from the beginning, deciding to take on the room most crucial to the experience, your sister Sam's room. This meant designing the main controls and interactions with objects, and then creating the environment present in the game with recreated assets and audio. So, we hope you enjoy Clon Clhome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9f/b9ff1f71f0e71453eacd842b28874e2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["kcp320"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
