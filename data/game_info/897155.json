I AM VERY SORRY HAKITA.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this project was to create assets for a template game in Unity in the style of an existing game. The framework chosen was 'Quest', a simple game in which the player just talks to an NPC, moves around with a 3rd person controller and collects 3 items.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game chosen for the asset style was ULTRAKILL. And so this is the story of 'V2' being trapped somewhere in the desert in 4-2 GOD DAMN THE SUN and hitching a lift with a Sentry Robot after fixing a dune buggy so he could be on time for the showdown with V1 in 4-4 CLAIR DE SOLEIL.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move. Q and E to rotate camera - it will sort out it's own vertical position :]. Shift to sprint. F to interact. Use the mouse to click on the dialogue options.</p><p>Assets used:</p><p>FREE Casual Game SFX Pack - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/free-casual-game-sfx-pack-5... <br/>ArbaA Experimental Chaabi - Layali - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfljKx9NpUc\u00a0<br/>'Quest Template' &amp; all assets therein - https://github.com/RKerrSAE/Quest_Template</p><p>All other visual assets - 3D models, UI and otherwise - made my myself.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c76/c767a39fab169d6ee56f329a0de40a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScotchCarb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
