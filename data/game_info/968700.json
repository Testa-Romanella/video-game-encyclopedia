If you have issues with a controller setup, it is likely caused by Steam's Desktop Controller configuration, which causes controller buttons to also press Keyboard keys. Turning this off will provide the best possible experience.<br/><br/>Hoboman is a 2D collectathon platformer with SNES-like graphics and a fun story centered around Pluto, a ship mechanic from the planet Voltra. When tragedy strikes, Pluto is thrown into a wild adventure to reclaim his old way of life. By stowing away on ships, Pluto stumbles on a plot that is larger than he could have imagined... <br/><br/>Throughout the game you'll come across geodes of various colors. Each color has it's own special behavior and method of claiming it:<br/><ul><li> Blue: A very common geode, every level has 15. Most are in plain sight, but keep your eyes peeled for a handful of more challenging ones!<br/></li><li> Red: Each level has a specific number of Foxslimes. If you defeat them all without dying, you'll be rewarded!<br/></li><li> Green: Race against the clock for this geode. However, you'll have to find the start and finish lines first!<br/></li><li> White: We don't want to spoil everything, but be on the lookout for hidden areas!<br/></li><li> Yellow: Trapped behind a plasma wall. You'll need a key... Surely some enemy within the level is carrying one!<br/></li><li> Purple: This elusive geode teleports to new areas when touched. Rumor has it that finding it 5 times is enough for it to fully materialize!</li></ul><h3> As you play, you'll also enjoy: </h3><ul><li> Enjoy a Sci-fi story with equal parts drama and silliness, with wild characters throughout.<br/></li><li> Explore open levels to find hidden geodes which have an impact on the story<br/></li><li> Complete mini challenges to earn special geodes and unlock special endings for each color.<br/></li><li> Enjoy forgiving gameplay, where there are no lives!
