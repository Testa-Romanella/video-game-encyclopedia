{"id": 9848, "slug": "medieval-engineers", "name": "Medieval Engineers", "name_original": "Medieval Engineers", "description": "The game is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people built architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Medieval Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and history and doesn't use any technologies that were not available in the 5th to 15th centuries.<br/><br/>Medieval Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as an action game too. We expect players to avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications. Medieval Engineers shouldn\u2019t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.<br/><br/>Medieval Engineers is the second \u201cengineering\u201d game developed by Keen Software House.

The performance will get better.  The performance depends on the complexity of your world and the configuration of your computer. Simple worlds run smoothly even on low-end computers, but a more complex world with rich object interactions could overload even high-end computers. <br/>Minimum requirements represent the bare minimum to run simple scenes and don\u2019t guarantee a perfect experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-28T19:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b62/b628098a688e9242f51ba55211982804.jpg", "website": "http://www.medievalengineers.com/", "rating": 3.26, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 299, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 17, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 27, "suggestions_count": 456, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 27, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keen Software House"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Keen Software House"], "esrb_rating": null}
