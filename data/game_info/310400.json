Yid is about a small story from Mishna, where a Rabbi is trapped by a town inside of a haunted school. Rav Aha Bar Ya'akov must only rely on his wits and faith to defend against a powerful seven-headed demon...</p>\n<p>Yid is a simple game with WASD and Arrow key controls. The game should only be about five to ten minutes long in total. If your worried about offending anyone, or this game being offensive, don't worry.
