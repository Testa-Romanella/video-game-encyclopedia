The game is also playable with keyboard, but I wouldn't recommend tackling the game like that alone (letting a second player take control of the bat works though).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T06:53:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da9890ff084458ad7af813c6f8bdaf56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["derboo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
