Whenever you are exposed, the Bugsnatcher's bottle will be closing in - so keep to the leaves!</p>\n<p><strong>===================================<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>[A][D] keys to move side to side</p>\n<p>[S] to fall slightly faster</p>\n<p>[Space] to flutter upwards</p>\n<p>===================================<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for TriJam #123, the jam where all games should be made in no more than three hours!\u00a0The game jam's theme was \"Hide or Get Caught\".
