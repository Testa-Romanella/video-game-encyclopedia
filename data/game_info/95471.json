The race track is generated from a series of noise filtered 'biome' styling functions. There are about 12 region types ranging from chasms to archways and caves, all generated in real time as the player progresses. I might post a more technical article about the actual methods used later. The only aim is to travel as far as possible, hampered by the fact that over time/distance the generation algorithms make the track more hazardous and convoluted.</p><p><strong>How to play:</strong></p><p><em>Race against the clock.<br/>Through a procedurally generated world.<br/>Pass hex gates to increase the time limit.<br/>Collect gems to fill the charge bar.<br/>Then press Boost for a short burst of speed.<br/>Jump to avoid barriers and glitch bombs.<br/>Press Self Destruct to escape dead ends.</em></p><p>Default keys:<br/>Arrows- Move, Space- Jump,<br/>Left Shift- Boost, X- Self destruct<br/>Use of a gamepad is recommended.</p><p>The audio is a generative mix of material by Noel Murphy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/039/0392608dce2cd96ec85fe266bbafe45a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["tomnullpointer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
