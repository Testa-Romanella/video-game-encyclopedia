We also have a zero tolerance ban policy, with players who are caught cheating being banned forever. We work to identify them and then ban all the new accounts that they will create. <br/><br/></li><li>NOT A SURVIVAL SHOOTERShattered Skies ultimately is not striving for hyper-realism. We want players to have fun. We're not about surviving, we're about shooting other players and monsters in order to get a better loot. <br/><br/></li><li>EXTENSIVE GUN CUSTOMIZATIONCustomize weapons you find in game with unique barrel, side rail, optic and grip modifications that instantly change the stats and handling of weapons.  Explore different combinations of weapon attachments to achieve truly unique weaponry fit to your own play style.

Certain rare weapons can also use an assortment of unique weapon skins that can be looted and traded for in the world of Shattered Skies.  <br/><br/></li><li>GLOBAL VAULTThe Global Vault is a protected permanent storage available to all players.  The Global Vault exists so that you can store your most valuable possessions for use at a later time.  Some items are best used in conjunction with others and so storing them away in your Global Vault is a great way to keep them protected until it's the right time to use them.  Global Vaults can be found within both Dominion Outposts as well as Brotherhood Hideouts.  <br/><br/></li><li>LOOTING &amp; WORLD EXPLORATIONCollect hundreds of lootable items that can be used in conjunction or independently making game play dynamic and unique each time you visit any area. Scattered throughout the world are: foods, liquids, weapons, weapon attachments, grenades, lootbags, deployables, landmines, traps, fortifications, armors and character customization's as well as special static loot crate spawns which can be opened like a treasure chest if you're lucky enough to find them. Supply Drops also float down from the sky randomly with precious rare loot and they are marked on your HUD to let everyone fight for them.  Shattered Skies is a full loot drop game where PVP is not only encouraged, it's rewarded.<br/><br/></li><li>FACTIONSThree factions coexist in The Valley, albeit not always peacefully. The Dominion have set up machinery to harvest alien materials and harness energy from the comet shards scattered throughout. Meanwhile the Crusaders Guild &amp; Brotherhood of Chaos are civilians and military alike who've joined forces and fight for control of the resource rich Valley. The Dominion pay out mercenary contracts to any soldier that can keep their equipment online, regardless of who's blood is shed in the process.<br/><br/></li><li>NON-COMBAT ZONES &amp; TRADINGTrade your wares with other fellow players as well as exchange goods and materials with vendors located in safe area Dominion Outposts and stock up your persistent Global Vault Storage with gear for the fight of your life.<br/><br/></li><li>DYNAMIC OBJECTIVESThere are multiple ways to collect rewards and earn experience via dynamic objectives available to players on the map:  Dominion Roadblocks, Merchant Guild Uplink Stations and the Dominion Reactor.  Roadblocks and Uplink Stations are solo or group PVE activities that provide rewards to players who can successfully repair the damaged equipment located around the objective and successfully secure it. The Dominion Reactor event is a special group only hybrid PVE/PVP activity in which groups must fight to stabilize the reactor.  The group that successfully stabilizes the reactor are all rewarded for their participation.  <br/><br/></li><li>CHARACTER PROGRESSION &amp; CUSTOMIZATIONSAdvance your character and gain experience by slaying aliens, completing map objectives, opening rare Loot Crates or killing other players.  As your character levels up you'll be able to equip higher level equipment that will help you in player vs player combat as well as against alien foes.  As you play the game and participate in activities you'll unlock permanent cosmetic items for your character that can be equip any time and do not ever drop on death.  Dress your character to suit your mood and charge into battle with style.  <br/><br/></li><li>DYNAMIC FORTIFICATIONEver wanted to fortify your favorite hiding spot?  Now you can with various fortifications which can be deployed on the fly for your convenience.

We're sure you'll find all sorts of uses for these deployable cover objects.  <br/><br/></li><li>FRIENDS &amp; GROUPS Shattered Skies is a PVP game at heart and we expect you to play with friends and group with others to tackle the objectives on the map as sometimes it can be dangerous to go alone.
