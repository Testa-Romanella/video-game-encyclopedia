It is easy to build in ragslash, and it is easy to make objects how you want them. With a component system that will be like Unity's own component system, you can certainly shape objects how you want to be.<br/><br/>Ragslash is still in development at the moment, so any suggestions you have for components, objects, tools, and stuff like that would be greatly appreciated. I\u00a0want to make this game how the people want it, rather than stuffing in a whole bunch of useless and boring features purely for the sake of quantity like a lot of other ragdoll games do.</p>\n<p><em>Ragslash is a project that I\u00a0have been working on for the past while and is basically my dream game. I would really appreciate it if you checked it out.\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T05:18:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a60e3845579f96af0cf2b37e1d384269.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chazzwazzler", "Superporkchops"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
