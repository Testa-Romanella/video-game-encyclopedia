This version of the game is a demo of the first \"arcade machine\", there will be more arcade machines added later on, with different scenarios and themes. The finished product will start the player in an arcade room full of light-gun machines, and once the player starts one of the machines they will be transported into the game world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T03:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf8/cf85e6e060ec8efb2b0b2666c16c6b5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew Gigante"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
