They meet in a cave not too far from her home, from which the player can create parties and use as a hub. Each day is presented as its own chapter, and invariably conclude with Mana&#39;s mother dragging her back home after a boss has been defeated. Mana&#39;s cat and frequent sidekick, Yuzu, acts as narrator between days/chapters.</p>\n<p>With its young cast and everyday slice-of-life comedic aesthetic, the game&#39;s been likened to the Mother/EarthBound series by critics. It&#39;s also intended for beginners: there&#39;s no penalty for losing a battle, and the player is offered the chance to restart the fight with a boost to one of their combat-related stats.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T15:54:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/163/163d72342f0beb00df9fb7ed52d65170.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["ITL", "ITL Co", "ITL Co."], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Pioneer"], "esrb_rating": null}
