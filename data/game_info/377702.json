These blocks can be shifted and shaped to create certain patterns, which are required to solve the puzzle. All blocks move at the same time in the same direction and interact with their environment. A puzzle is solved when the movable blocks fill out the required shape with a certain pattern.</p>\n<p>You navigate through six different worlds with their own themes and mechanics and free the world bit by bit with each level solved. Each world has its own style of gameplay and requires different ways of thinking to solve the puzzles.</p>\n<p><strong>You can play the DEMO VERSION in your browser here:</strong><br/>http://www.hofbauer-games.at/demos/bitlock/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8b759015b6ad572bb05f3741618a043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Peyda"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
