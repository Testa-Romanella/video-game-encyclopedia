If you found this:\u00a0Sorry for stealing your time ;)<br/></p>\n<p>The story so far:<br/>It is halloween. The birds are singing, the doorbells are ringing and the children are collecting sweets. Every child, except Edeltraud. Edeltraud is an idiot. She wants to have\u00a0tons of candy, but running around the neighbourhood is so exhausting! Edeltraud heard about a creepy castle behind the cementary. There must be halloween-pros with lots of candy living in this not so cozy place! Some kind of doctor lives there - hope he is not a dentist.</p>\n<p>So Edeltraud cuts holes in moms best bedsheet and walks with a basket in her hand towards the castle. She opens the big, heavy gate of the fence and enters the cementary.\u00a0Believe it or not, there were plenty of sweets in the castle\u00b4s shed. Suddenly the gate shut with a loud bang!\u00a0The gate wont open anymore, so the only way home is through the creepy castle. Will Edeltraud survive this adventure and get back home with her basket full of sweets?</p>\n<p>This horrible horror game features:</p>\n<ul><li>15 challenging levels. Okay, 9 challenging levels - the rest is easy as pie.</li><li>The first appereance of Edeltraud, the lazy brat</li><li>Eyeballs. So many Eyeballs!</li><li>Green Ghost-Souls. First they were lost souls, but luckily I\u00a0found them</li><li>Friendly gigantic pumpkins</li><li>Climbable corpses (they won\u00b4t matter)</li><li>Puzzles with switches. Yeah, I knew you like it!</li><li>Retro soundtrack - better than licking silicone-ears!</li></ul>\n<p>Control Edeltraud using the left and right\u00a0arrow-key. Press Up or C to jump. The rest should be pretty self-explaining. Really..... its not THAT hard!</p>\n<p>Could make problems on Mac using Safari or Firefox - Sorry for that!</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>Black Hole (Dark Fantasy Studio)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T09:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80dd029b9d9f3af61c317c23ac071ae5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelPoldi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
