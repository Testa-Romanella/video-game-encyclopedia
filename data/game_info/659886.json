Fill the board with the corresponding animals with the correct rotation. Do so before the poor lads fall into the spikes!<br/></p>\n<p>There's only one small detail though - you can't rotate the animals directly! Thankfully, you have a set of friendly planes that will shoot friendly bullets at them to manipulate them!</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The animals are controlled with <strong>LEFT </strong>and <strong>RIGHT </strong>arrow keys.</li><li>Use your <strong>SPACE </strong>key to switch between the three planes:<ul><li>The <strong>BLUE </strong>plane shoots bullets that\u00a0rotate the animal.</li></ul><ul><li>The <strong>YELLOW </strong>plane will transform an animal into another animal.</li></ul><ul><li>The <strong>RED </strong>plane will invert gravity for that animal.</li></ul></li><li>Use the <strong>UP </strong>key to shoot bullets with the selected plane!</li><li>Use the <strong>DOWN </strong>key to accelerate the falling animal downwards.</li></ul><p><strong>Losing</strong></p><ul><li>You lose when you get three strikes.
