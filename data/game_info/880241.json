The objective to collect wrenches, and fix generators to clear each level. You can kill ghost, and bats by using bullets, and you can kill mushrooms by jumping on it. Collect hearts to regenerate 1 health, collect apples to regenerate 2 health, and collecting diamonds are optional. Stepping in mud slows you down, holding up will allow you to jump higher on trampolines, and you must wait for the red blocks to appear and disappear before continuing. Have fun on your adventure.
