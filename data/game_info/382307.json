We channeled our Sonic the Hedgehog - Chao Garden memories, Toejam &amp; Earl funky vibes, and the anxiety of hoping that your Tamagotchi is still alive when you get home after school into this game jam.</strong></p>\n<p><em>There isn't really an end goal to this game or an ending per se. It's just a chill little pet simulator where you can watch, guide, and feed your little blobs. We hope you enjoy the relaxed vibes and that you love your little blobs as much as we do!</em></p>\n\n<p>Kudos to @Gingerloaf for helping out!! He did a majority of the programming and made a chill song. ThunderAwesome (me) did some programming and all of the art.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:35:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8c/b8c5d42cb5ad066086a13248ea4fd319.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Battlerock"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
