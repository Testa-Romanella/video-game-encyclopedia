However, due to unforeseen events, \u00a0the project was not finished, so you will see bugs and unused HUDs throughout the game. It was originally planned to be a metroidvania but with the time my team and I had, we resorted to making it a platformer/asteroids type game.</p>\n<p>I have also posted the source code of this game on my GitHub if you are curious as to how me and the other programmer made it work. I designed the title screen and the platforming level while my programming partner did the metroid-type level.<br/></p>\n<p>Viper I One Source Code<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T09:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59c/59c9b339ad35ef2004cac53658a252ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Edge"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
