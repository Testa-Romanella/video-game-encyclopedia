Which can be seen here with some drawn pixelated sprites by me!</p>\n<p>https://susul.itch.io/dim</p>\n<p>I'm also thinking of recreating this game in Godot, but like, I'm still learning at it!<br/></p>\r\nStory So Far...\r\n<p>This game is about a <strong>Coalkin</strong>, a lump of coal that can only <strong>Move</strong>, <strong>Feel</strong>, <strong>See</strong>, and <strong>Combust </strong>into <strong>Flames</strong>. His name is <strong>Dim </strong>who recently received the <strong>\"Heart of Breeze\"</strong>. Because of this, he must go to the down to the <strong>Earth</strong>'s core to prevent the planet from exploding. with <strong>Whimsal </strong>guiding him with his journey. However, if he reaches his goal, he must die and sacrifice his life with the <strong>\"Heart of Breeze\"</strong>. Leaving <strong>Dim</strong> in sorrows...</p>\r\nControls.\r\n<strong>Z</strong><strong>Jump</strong><strong>X</strong><strong>Flame</strong>/<strong>Combust </strong>(Increase in Tempt and as well movement)<br/><strong>Arrow Keys</strong><br/><strong>Movement</strong>\r\nAlso!\r\n<p>If reached to a certain temperature,\u00a0<strong>Dim</strong>, will \"explode\" or just die.

The game itself is incredibly short as it's a school project. Sometimes, the character may go off-screen, you may press \"<strong>9</strong>\" in your keyboard which hopefully reset your position.</p>\n<p> I'm not adding anymore content, currently just resolving some bugs, and polishing up\u00a0 the gameplay.</p>\n<p>This is my first time publishing a game, please give me feedback on this and how I'm doing this.
