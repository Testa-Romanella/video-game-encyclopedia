We came up with a really idiotic idea \u2013 you are driving an ambulance, while consantly giving a massage to a heart meant for transplantation. The blood from the heart is\u00a0squirting on your windscreen, that you have to wipe to see the road and avoid the obstacles. With such a brilliant idea, we had no other option than just to get make it happen.</p>\n<p>Why Swiss? The ambulance should have been a white car with a red cross. We've got it mixed up and since the white cross on a red field is a flag of Switzerland - voil\u00e1, we've got ourselves the theme!</p>\n<p><strong>The Authors</strong></p>\n<p>S.S.S.C.F.A.T.T. is a joint project of\u00a0Please Wait\u00a0( Syky &amp; Moti ) and\u00a0Jarnik.</p>\n<p>We are a group of fellow indie developers, making games that we want to play.</p>\n<p>Follow us:\u00a0@Jarnik\u00a0|\u00a0@Syky\u00a0|\u00a0@Moti</p>\r\n\r\nReviews &amp; mentions\r\n<ul><li>IndieGames.com:\u00a0Freeware Pick - SSSCFATT</li><li>FunzoGuru:\u00a0WTH AM I PLAYING!? - SSSCFATT\u00a0(VIDEO)</li><li>TheTanZelShow:\u00a0We Play SSSCFATT\u00a0(VIDEO)</li><li>IndeeGames.cz:\u00a0SSSCFATT</li><li>IndieStatik.com:\u00a0Three-way: SSSCFATT</li><li>!!!
