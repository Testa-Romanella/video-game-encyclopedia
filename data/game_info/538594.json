Zombies and brains are spawning on a regular base. Now chase a zombie to a brain. The zombie will eat it and disappear.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>There are two markers showing you where the next zombie/brain will spawn. A <strong>red sphere</strong>\u00a0shows the location of the next zombie and a <strong>green sphere</strong>\u00a0shows the next brain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But be aware to not run into a brain with your character. Brains are only for zombies! Catching a brain will have a negative effect which will slow you down for a while.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You won't be able to decrease the amount of zombies - but you can try to keep it on a stable level. Every time a zombie eats a brain another zombie will spawn and reset the timer. Again: You don't get rid of a zombie - but you gained time before the next zombie spawns!</p>\n<p><strong>Happy Feeding</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T05:21:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c2/6c233765eb8d0dd20b48864e65de8ec8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
