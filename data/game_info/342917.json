If you get cut off by other player's recent jumpers you have to navigate back to the last place you colour jumped and continue the wave another direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of the game players can find party people that are indicated by the small light green arrow above their heads. Party people send a shock wave of jumpers out in every direction but watch out as occasionally it might not be your colour of wave.</p>\n<p>To change the AI to player ratio you can left click on a player while the game is paused to toggle the AI.</p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Press Space, Escape or Enter\u00a0to start &amp; pause game. <br/>Press F1 to restart game.</strong></p>\r\nPlayer Colour\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Movement Keys\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0RedW, A,\u00a0S, DYellowT, F, G, HBlueI, J, K, LGreenArrow Keys", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T03:26:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e9/7e9eb45d6da04dfaa053d0144be5d9fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sugoi Yellow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
