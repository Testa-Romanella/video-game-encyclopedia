Players will receive a starting bonus in Saise-hen based on how many times they have completed Hakai-hen, along with an extra bonus for playing all of Hakai-hen&#39;s scenarios, but unlocked machines and pilots will not transfer.</p>\n<p>Every series from Hakai-hen returns, with their sequels/second seasons debuting if applicable. Macross 7 makes its Z-series debut, with Dynamite 7 appearing for the first time in any SRW. The only completely new series, Tetsujin 28, is the 1980s incarnation of a robot series that predates even Mazinger.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-21T13:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/429/4296e237101de1ac0339d6881d62cdcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 27, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["B.B.
