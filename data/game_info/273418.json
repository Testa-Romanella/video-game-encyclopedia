I had the idea to make a 2D platform that relies on having to sacrifice your current character to change shape in order to advance in the level.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the game has only 2 levels, because I spent a lot of time trying to create a character type of Jelly /fluid but I did not succeed.</p>\n<p>However, this jam was very interesting for me because it allowed me to do things that I\u2019m not used to and that\u2019s the main thing. Free Sound Used.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance, to all the people who will take the time to try the game and give me feedback on it.!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/7932bc7f02aaaeb8fa9f9705d41834a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tasaka"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
