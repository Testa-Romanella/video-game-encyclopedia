I would also create 3-5 level in each world. I have already developed most of the mechanics for the game, including 5 power ups that the player would unlock throughout\u00a0the game. There is also a\u00a0real wacky backstory that fits perfect for the game (at least in my head :)\u00a0</p>\r\nThanks For Playing!!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T02:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a7/3a72bc63df6ff149192761a7ce7a9f4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hozeis"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
