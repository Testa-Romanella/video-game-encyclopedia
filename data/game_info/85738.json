Have you got what it takes? <br/><br/>These are a few of the sights you\u2019ll see on the road to ruin:<br/> - Create and manage any kind of band you want: from hip hop crew to barbershop quartet<br/> - More than 30 customizable musicians to choose from <br/> - Trash hotel rooms, check into rehab, get kidnapped by crazed fans<br/> - Play at dodgy bars, smoke-filled clubs, concert halls, stadiums and massive arenas<br/> - Earn it the hard way: big bucks, rabid groupies, quirky nicknames and new instruments<br/> - Train your amateur musicians into talented veterans before they join a cult or drown in a pool of their own vomit<br/> - No tour is the same: hundreds of different challenges to survive<br/><br/>NOTE: This game is not fully optimized for iPad, iPhone SE or Plus! But it's planned for future updates. If you have any ideas or feedback to make the game even better, please get in touch. <br/><br/>FAQ<br/><br/>Q: Is this one of those dumb music rhythm games?<br/>A: No, it\u2019s more of a rogue-like, choose-your-own-adventure, management game. With bears.<br/><br/>Q: I\u2019m lost, what should I do?<br/>A: Keep playing gigs and training your musicians talent until they are famous enough to get invited to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And don't let them go insane!<br/><br/>Q: How do I customize my musicians?<br/>A: Tap on the tour bus then tap a musician to view their details. Just tap on their name to change it. As you earn groupies, you will unlock more customization options, like nicknames and new instruments.<br/><br/>Q: What's the recommended way to play this game?<br/>A: The game is best played while sitting on the toilet. Pace yourself though - don't try to complete it in one sitting! The game is a little easier the more musicians you have in your band.<br/><br/>Q: How does the talent system work?<br/>A: You can buy talent points (show as stars on the character screen) or earn them during the game. The more talented your musicians are the better they will perform at gigs, earning you more fans, money and groupies.<br/><br/>Q: All my musicians are going insane!<br/>A: If all of your musicians get 6 sanity (shown as skulls on the character screen) then it's game over. You can pay $3,000 to remove 1 sanity skull.<br/><br/>Q: How do I get more money?<br/>A: Mostly by playing gigs. Money can be hard to come by at the start, but once you start playing at bigger venues the money starts rolling in. Many of the random events along the way also pay out much-needed cash, so stop at as many waypoints as you can. <br/><br/>Q: How many musicians should I choose?<br/>A: You can choose a minimum of 2, max of 5. The is a little easier the more musicians you have in your band.<br/><br/>Q: What's a waypoint?<br/>A: They are the little white circles with grey outlines on the map screen. Tap on them to move your tour van towards the next gig - gigs are shown as stars.<br/><br/>Q: I'm stuck on the map and can't click on the next waypoint or gig!<br/>A: Sometimes our musicians get a little confused - try clicking on some of the other waypoints on the map. If that doesn't work, try quitting the game and reloading.<br/><br/>Q: Who are the Dead Silent Film Stars?<br/>A: We\u2019re a 3-piece rock and blues band based in Stockholm, Sweden. The music you hear in the game was written and recorded by us. To find out more visit www.deadsilentfilmstars.com.<br/><br/>Q: This game is kinda repetitive?<br/>A: It's a pretty basic game, as you can expect from the price. It's the first game I've released, and I made everything myself - the graphics, coding, writing and music. If you want to make it more interesting try a band with just 2 musicians and name them after you and your best friend.<br/><br/>Q: Why are there no keytars?<br/>A: Are you kidding me?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32c/32cdb18636bc40df1afd411ab020437b.jpg", "website": "http://www.deadsilentfilmstars.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Reuben Keeling"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Reuben Keeling"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
