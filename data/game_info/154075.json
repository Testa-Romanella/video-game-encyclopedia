This is to \r\nchallenge the natural inclination to find the Tlic and grubs repulsive, \r\nwhich is damaging to the effort of mutual symbiosis between the Tlic and\r\n Terran. As T\u2019Gatoi says, \u201cHow could I put my children into the care of \r\none who hates them?\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/><br/>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe objective of the game is simple; as a grub, you must feed on \r\nparts of the hosts\u2019 body \u2013 in this case, alluding to a male host in \r\nBloodchild. Between each stage is a small section of a poem from the \r\nperspective of the grub. As the stages continue, the grub grows in size \r\nand must consume more parts. The use of \u201cwe\u201d is to represent multiple \r\ngrubs and a unified conscious. The metaphor of trees is used to draw a \r\nparallel to an organism that holds more sentimental value with humans. \r\nTowards the end, I use \u201cI\u201d in order to humanize and evoke sadness in the\r\n voice of a single grub. The tree metaphor is also used for the notion \r\nof dependence and growth from one larger base; the body of the host, in \r\nthis case, takes the place of earth and soil. Additionally, trees have \r\nbeen demonstrated to form a network through root systems, effectively \r\ncreating a colony, or one large unified entity.\r\n\t\t<br/><br/>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOnly as the grub grows does it understand that its host is its \r\nparent, and begins to feel remorse for consuming the body. Towards the \r\nend, the grub declares its innocence while also admitting its guilt, as \r\nit feels responsible for the death of the loved one who nurtured its \r\ngrowth. It pleads for them to live, as the screen cuts to red with a \r\nlingering static. At this point, the game remains on the red screen \r\nindefinitely; this is to characterize the ambiguous nature of death, but\r\n also suggest the bloody image of Tlic birth, or, grubs being removed \r\nfrom a host.\r\n\t\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["keb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
