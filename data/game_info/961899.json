{"id": 961899, "slug": "colorlines-2", "name": "Colorlines", "name_original": "Colorlines", "description": "Colorlines was the original Russian DOS version of Lines. It is a turn-based board game. Each turn, three randomly colored chips fall on random grid of a 9x9 squares board. <br/><br/>Your mission in Colorlines is to re-locate the chips (by moving one of them per turn) to form lines consisting of five or more chips of the same color. The lines can be arranged vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each line you build immediately disappears, giving you points. There is basically no end to the game, but your first objective is to surpass the 3000 points scored. You lose when the entire board is filled with chips.<br/><br/>The game runs in a 1024 x 768 windowed screen and it can be enlarged or shrunk as needed.  This allows you to play the game as you work on other tasks!<h3>Key Features of Colorlines:</h3><br/><ul><li>Infinite number of levels.<br/></li><li>No hidden data connections!<br/></li><li>No Ads!<br/></li><li>Save/Load Current Game<br/></li><li>Achivements<br/></li><li>Leaderboard<br/></li><li>Cloud Saves<br/></li><li>Sound Settings<br/></li><li>New look and feel, same Retro style<br/></li><li>Better movement tool to check if a chip can move to a location you select<br/></li><li>High Score and Turn Count Tracking<br/></li><li>Scoring Detail Counts<br/></li><li>Match horizontal, vertical, and diagonally<br/></li><li>432 Hz - Deep Healing Music for The Body &amp; Soul</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T03:05:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3ca7f031ee50717c5d50657998eb0fba.jpg", "website": "https://lazymuttgames.com/games/Colorlines/Product", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Charles Nutting"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lazy Mutt Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
