The objective is to score as many points as possible by destroying all segments of the millipede as it moves toward the bottom of the screen, as well as destroying and avoiding other enemies. The game is played with a trackball and a single fire button, which can be held down for rapid-fire. The game is over when the player's last life is lost.</p>\n<p>Millipede was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit family, Atari ST, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-09T02:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9f65fe252e322c8945956b6ce526c27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Atari 8-bit", "Game Boy", "PC", "Game Boy Advance", "NES", "Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Atari"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": null}
