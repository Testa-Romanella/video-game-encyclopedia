It\u2019s also home for you, the Player, if only for a brief  moment. You have been cursed, and grim fate awaits you! Quite literally  in fact, you might die in about 25 seconds from the start of the game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Fast paced FPS combat with beholders, ticking death clock and choices that have fun consequences.</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>Slash your way through the keep, collect Skulls to keep the curse at  bay and change the rules of the game.
