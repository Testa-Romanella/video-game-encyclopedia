Based on feedback I've changed the movement to not be as punishing. Mainly the gravity is changed so you don't fall as fast and some of the earlier levels have been tweaked. Keep the feedback coming :)<br/></p>\n<p>Edit 20170528: You can now jump with Y button, this is to make it easier for players with German keyboards.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ac/5ac625629bb50b270be1d060268f03bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shotgun Anaconda"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
