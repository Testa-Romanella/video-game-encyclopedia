Destroy them before they hit or get past you using your X laser.</p>\n<p>The only way to stop the invasion is by spelling words! Japanese words pop up at the bottom in Romaji - spell the English translation by shooting the letters in the correct order using your Z laser!\u00a0</p><p>I.e. If \"inu\" is displayed, you spell \"dog\"</p>\n<p>Completing a word replenishes 1 armour. Spell 3 words correctly and you win!</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>My first game using Game Maker Studio, so a lot of rough stuff and messy code. Did the fantastic tutorial over at\u00a0http://learn.heartbeast.co/, and decided that I would try and use what I\u00a0learnt there and adjust that game-type into a teaching experience for the game jam. This was built from the ground up again, but a chunk of the basic code is edited from that tutorial, though a lot of it is original (letter checking, laser types etc). Letter spawn frequency needs major adjustment.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong>:</p>\n<p>Almost all art and sound assets are from\u00a0http://learn.heartbeast.co/</p>\n<p>Not assets, but I\u00a0listened to this pretty much exclusively -\u00a0https://musicforprogramming.net/</p>\n<p><strong>To Add in the Future:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Own assets</li><li>Letter spawn frequency changes with the word you need to spell</li><li>Japanese text display for words</li><li>Ways of easily importing/adjusting vocabulary lists to aid teachers</li><li>No duplicates of words in the same playthrough</li><li>Powerups? Maybe?</li><li>Collection bar displays in same font as letters coming down</li><li>More polish and better everything</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4f/d4f22dcb9c5dbd8adff454f0b12f2398.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter U"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
