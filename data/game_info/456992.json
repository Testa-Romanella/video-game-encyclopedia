But I did spend a week working on it, and you are here. <br/>My scope was way off, and I did learn new things with this Jam.</p>\n<p>So thank you for being here! I tried to leave instructions,<br/>if it crashes, you can always reload the page (until I finally figure out how to reset\u00a0 :D )</p>\n<p>Have a look around, \"play\" what you can<br/>and any feedback is greatly appreciated!<br/>\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) Please wait until the level loads.<br/>2) If you want a different map, press SPACE (and wait again). WARNING! If you press SPACE when playing, the game will most likely crash.<br/>2) Press R/T to spawn a player (keep spamming for company!)<br/>3) X to spawn NPC people and ZOOM out here again</p><p>Nothing you can do other than explore and try the procedural generation of the different maps. I would suggest spawning just one player if your computer lags.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T02:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e0619a971c6c83cbd461c911dd728ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spoonsweet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
