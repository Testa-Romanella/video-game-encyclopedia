The enemies in the game spawn trash that must be collected and deposited in the fishing nets, once deposited you are rewarded with ammunition you can use to defeat the polluters. If you don\u2019t reach trash in time, it will disintegrate and add to the building waste level on the ocean floor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:04:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d59/d59a3d3444c834d04a3fdf350efd2569.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Werti0"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
