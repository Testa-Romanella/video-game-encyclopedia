A young boy stumbles out from the forest, bloody and asking for help. He\u2019s been sent to find a former soldier, disgraced and in self-imposed exile, because she may be the only person who truly understands the danger posed by this new foe and has the capacity to stop him.</p>\n<p>Ten years have passed since a community of dead villagers seemed to have risen from the grave, and four years have passed since the failed Rescue at Moranthia. The Shatter Teams have disbanded. Calista Strelley has retired to a peaceful, if not particularly fulfilling, life in the rural hinterlands. The boy seeking her help talks of a powerful summoner, gifted with abilities only matched by those spoken about in rumors and battlefield tales. To stop him, Cal will have to rely on her trusty direwolf companion and her old Shatter Team partner, Garrard Dwirisa. They will be joined on their adventure by two orphans with secrets of their own, as well as a former enemy spy who may be more trouble than she is worth.</p>\n<p>Their journey will take them deep into the wilderness of the Kingdom of Laurentide and beyond, searching for knowledge and ancient technology that may hold the key to defeating the mad summoner. All the while, the kingdom\u2019s newly installed king is preparing for an annual celebration and monitoring the emergence of a new, puzzling religion.</p>\n<p>This game is the third in a series of <em>At Last Alone</em> adventures.

Very frustrating! If this happens: Save, fully close out of the program, reopen, and load the save. If you're a brilliant Ruby scripter, lemme know and we can fix it together!</p>\n<p><strong>Spoilers and Trigger Warnings</strong><br/>This game was written by an adult and is meant for a more mature audience. If it were a movie, it would be PG-13 maybe? No bewbz or anything, but the game does include discussions about depression and suicide, cannibalism, and child murder. There are also pixellated disembowelings and blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow it all on Instagram!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T04:45:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86c/86ccac44af395107c312c7f846a67f6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KodiakGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
