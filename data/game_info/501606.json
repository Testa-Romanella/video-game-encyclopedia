If one of them die, it's game over, so be careful about both\u00a0their health points !</p>\n<p>This is a small prototype I made in summer 2018 with Unity\u00a0after one year of programming. I was curious on how RPGs battle system, UI and dialogues could be made, so I tried my best to reproduce it with the knowledge I had back then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It has its own\u00a0share of bugs, but nothing that should get you stuck\u00a0!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><em>Mouse :</em> Move the Camera</p>\n<p><em>Mouse Left Click :</em> Click on buttons, exit dialogues</p>\n<p><em>Left/Right/Up/Down Keyboard arrow :</em> Move your Character</p>\n<p><em>Spacebar :</em> Jump, Talk</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes inputs don't work on the first try, especially Talk.
