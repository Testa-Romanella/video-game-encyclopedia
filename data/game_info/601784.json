This project started off as a learning tool so that I could teach myself how to program in UE4. However, it has progressed to the point where I'm happy to share it here!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>THE CURRENT BUILD: PROTOTYPE V1.0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>While still very much in its infancy, the current build offers the following features:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>1 vs 1 local multiplayer. The game is currently multiplayer only; I'll be looking into AI down the road.\u00a0</li><li>Three luchadors, each with a secondary outfit.</li><li>A dynamic camera system to track the action.</li><li>A melee attack system with weak and strong attacks, and a defensive system with dodging and blocking.</li><li>Health, stamina, and damage systems. Matches are currently only able to end in KO victories or time limit draws; I'll be exploring pins and submissions in the future.</li><li>AKI-style grappling\u00a0&amp; grappling Moves: grab your opponent, and then tap a button to perform a move while in a collar-and-elbow tie-up.</li><li>Taunting, special meters, and finishing moves.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Please Note: You'll need controllers to play, though menus are currently handled through mouse/touch input.</strong></em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Control Stick: Move Luchador</li><li>A Button: Grapple Attempt</li><li>X Button: Weak Melee/Running Weak Melee</li><li>Y Button: Strong\u00a0Melee/Strong Melee Attack</li><li>Left Shoulder: Dodge Backwards</li><li>Right Shoulder: Block</li><li>Right Trigger: Run. <em>Rebound off of ropes to make running attacks stronger!</em></li><li>D-Pad Up: Appeal to Crowd</li><li>Start: Pause Game</li></ul>\n<p>After landing a grapple attempt:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>A, B, X, or Y: Grapple Move</li><li>Right Shoulder: Release Grapple</li><li>D-Pad Up: Finisher (when special meter is flashing).\u00a0<em>Fill your special meter by appealing to the crowd or landing grapple moves!</em></li></ul>\n<p>As mentioned, I'm very new to any programming work in UE4. This project essentially amounts to my first five months of self-teaching. There's plenty I look forward to implementing in the future as I continue to learn more!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>FUTURE UPDATES</strong></p>\n<p>You can follow the game's progression via my channel on youtube. I'll be updating with dev logs, featurettes, progress updates, and more!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T07:01:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/684/68436dcb29a4dd38fc103a3505dde7de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UE4Luchador"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
