He wants to find someone who understands him, someone that loves him and that sees him as normal and not the unstable mess he\u2019s convinced he is.\r\n  </p>\n<p>  Please have a look around, read our synopsis, watch our trailers! <br/></p>\n<br/><br/>And don't forget to play our demo (which acts as our prologue) to get a better idea of what <strong>Grand Kokoro \u2013 Episode 1</strong> is all about.\r\n<p><strong>Thanks! </strong></p>\n\n<p>The once bright and beautiful city of Crown Crest is still trying to recover from a tragedy that happened almost five years ago. This is when their most beloved symbol of unification, \u201cThe Colonnade,\u201d collapsed. Once it fell it fractured the city of Crown Crest, devastating hundreds of thousands of lives and creating a new social class of people \u2013 The SURs, or Survivors of Colonnade.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>That\u2019s what Elijah Grand is \u2013 a SUR.   </strong></p>\n<p>Your life is over once you\u2019re labelled a SUR. You\u2019re seen as untouchable, suicidal, diseased and infectious. You become the carrier of \u201cSUR fever,\u201d a disease that rots the mind and causes hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. At least that\u2019s what the people of Crown Crest believe.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Elijah has spent the last five years running from his past and concealing his true nature. At first, running away was easy, but as the days wore on, his memories of the day The Colonnade collapsed began to creep back into his life. Whenever he felt stressed, excited or scared, his memories came rushing back and there was nothing he could do.\r\n  </p>\n<p>These \u201crecalls\u201d as his doctor calls them, are becoming more frequent, and they\u2019re starting to disrupt his daily life. They\u2019re making him question his sanity.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Are these just recalls? Is it SUR Fever? Is SUR Fever real? Will anyone find out? Can I just be normal?\r\n  </strong></p>\n<p>These are the thoughts and questions that run through Elijah\u2019s head as he tries to live a normal life, while navigating through a world he\u2019s been absent from for over five years.   </p>\n<p><strong>Can he survive?\r\n  </strong></p>\n<p>With the help of his two best friends, Lucien and Sebastian, he most certainly can; however they too carry a troublesome secret, one that sees them put on a list of would-be victims. Sebastian has been able to keep Lucien and himself safe thanks to his family\u2019s power and influence, but there\u2019s only so much that money and political ties can hide until the truth finally reveals itself.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Join Elijah, Lucien and Sebastian in \u201c<strong>Grand Kokoro \u2013 Episode 1</strong>\u201d as they unearth the secrets surrounding the collapse of The Colonnade building, the powerful families known as \u201cThe Legacy\u2019s,\u201d and a political movement known as \u201cThe Pure,\u201d which can change everything.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>\u201cBeing a SUR isn\u2019t what you think it is.\u201d\r\n  </strong><br/></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Roughly 4-5 hours.</li><li><strong>Original Soundtrack: </strong>20+ songs.</li><li><strong>Kinetic Visual Novel</strong> w/limited choices - Choices do not affect the story.</li><li><strong>Unique game flow: </strong>Go from kinetic to standard visual novel and back to kinetic.</li><li><strong>Romantic CG's: </strong>Romantic and somewhat\u00a0risqu\u00e9 cg's can be found in-game.</li><li><strong>Platform(s):</strong> Itch.io &amp; Steam.</li><li><strong>System(s): </strong>Windows.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Did you find a bug?
