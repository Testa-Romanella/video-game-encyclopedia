Click near your character to walk there, click farther away from your character to run. If you click above your character, you'll also jump. Hold down your mouse button to make longer jumps or continue walking or running in that direction.</p>\n<p>The starting area is your home. From here, you can customize your character, adopt a pet, shop and play in the arcade. When you're ready to set out on an adventure, hop into the blimp. From there, you can travel to one of Poptropica's many islands, each with its own quests and adventures.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T03:07:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b2d8a0f356791a5cfd052023ef58975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joey Nigro"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
