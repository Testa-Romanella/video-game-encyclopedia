To unlock face-down cards in the 7 tableau stacks, send cards to the foundations or pile them in the tableau stacks in descending order and in alternating colors. Go through the deck to access more face-down cards - but be careful, this consumes Fuel. Each card sent to the foundation stacks helps the train go forward according to its speed. Reach the next Station before running out of Fuel.<br/><br/>Contact info: <br/>Let us know about your journey by sending us postcards at community@mavenhut.com.
