Most of us seem to believe the center of the Earth contains nothing but stone and darkness, but it might not be as different from our world as you think.</p>\n<p>Elemental beings made of magma form societies much like ours, and - as we know all too well - where rules exist, conflict is bound to emerge. Cali, a young magma elemental reached a turning point in her life: the time has come for her escape, running away from the clutches of the rigid society that surrounds her.</p>\n<p>It is your mission to guide Cali through this platformer inside a raging volcano and help her reach the summit which she always dreamed of seeing. But wait, there\u2019s a twist! Cali can\u2019t be controlled like a normal platformer character. Being unable to walk or jump, the young magma spirit can only move through impulses from her elemental powers, which, in turn, must be recharged by the volcano\u2019s energy.</p>\n<p>Will you be able to help Cali experience a whole new world, or will she have to go back to being just another flame burning closer to extinction?</p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/><br/>Mouse - Click and Drag<br/><br/>Use your mouse to slingshot Cali into the air by clicking and dragging, but be careful! You'll only be able to do it again after coming in contact with one of the platforms, so aim carefully and bounce away!<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><strong>Collaborators:</strong></p>\n<p>Game Designers:</p>\n<p>Bernardo Gadelha (https://shyvan.itch.io/)<br/></p>\n<p>Andr\u00e9 Ruiz (https://andrerx.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Jo\u00e3o Victor Galindo (https://itch.io/profile/doublejv)</p>\n\n<p>Artists:</p>\n<p>Daniel Oliveira (https://dannyvegas.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Rafael Assun\u00e7\u00e3o (https://instagram.com/rafeizer)</p>\n\n<p>Sound Designer/Composer:</p>\n<p>Bernardo Gadelha\u00a0(https://shyvan.itch.io/)</p>\n\n<p>Programmer:</p>\n<p>Michelle Santiago (https://itch.io/profile/misantiago17)</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to every member of the RPG- Rio PUC Games team (https://rpgriopucgames.itch.io/), from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb988efd74da65267f9495ab4665006.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DannyVegas", "misantiago17", "andrerx", "Shyvan", "doublejv"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
