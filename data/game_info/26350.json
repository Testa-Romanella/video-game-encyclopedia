Help the worker move from the \n      building on the left to the office on the right.<br/>Nintendo first \n      began releasing the Game &amp; Watch series in 1980. This collection of \n      games was available on portable LCD devices, and each title featured a \n      game and a clock. Each Game &amp; Watch title features two modes of play: \n      GAME A (normal difficulty) and GAME B (more advanced play). While some \n      controls have been changed in the DSiWare version to better suit the \n      Nintendo DSi system, the appearance of the game itself has not been \n      altered.\n    </p><p>\n      Tools are falling from the sky! Help the worker at the construction site \n      move from the building on the left to the office on the right while \n      avoiding the hammers, wrenches, and pliers dropping from above. Earn \n      five points for entering the office and one point for every three tools \n      that hit the ground.
