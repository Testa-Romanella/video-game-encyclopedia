As the player, you will use a grappling hook to traverse through each level and reach the portal at the end. With just a left click of the mouse, you can throw the grappling hook towards a platform, and it will connect to the point where it hits.\r\n</p>\n<p>But it's not just a matter of throwing the hook and crossing your mouse - you must strategically plan your path by clicking the right mouse button to navigate where the hook will attach. By connecting the hook to multiple points, you can create a path that allows you to traverse across the platforms and avoid obstacles.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you progress through each level, you'll encounter locked doors that require a key to unlock. Keep an eye out for these keys as they are crucial to advancing through the game. With a total of 5 levels, each one increasing in difficulty, you'll need to hone your skills and master the use of the grappling hook to complete the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Are you up for the challenge?
