I added music to each level and the main menu. Also the level win sound is different.</p>\n<p>2. I made an entire level 3 to the game.</p>\n<p>3. The main menu and all the levels have a different background, different amounts of enemies, and the enemies/player has different movement speeds and shooting speeds for each level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. The level select buttons are spaced out evenly and there is now instructions and movement descriptions.\u00a0</p><p>5. The name for the game is now Galactic Blaster.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by Andrew Jamison</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T08:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3eb/3eb0d68b36fa63e87356a6dc49ed8d5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Werdna821"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
