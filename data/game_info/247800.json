The machines glow according to their type. The iron miner is blue, the stone miner is yellow and the mineral miner is red.<br/></p>\n<p>In addition to stone, iron and minerals there is also energy, which the machines use in order to function. The only way to generate energy is to destroy machines. Which means the  machines feed off their own kind.</p>\n<p>There is also a bigger central serpent headed machine that can not be destroyed. It consumes a small amount of fuel at the beginning, but as the game goes on it uses up more and more fuel.</p>\n<p>The game is over once all of the fuel has been consumed.<br/></p>\n<p>Edit:<br/>Whoops, buttons and indicators got messed up with the resolution change. <br/></p><p>Assetes used:</p><p>Soundeffects:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0https://freesound.org/people/waveplay_old/sounds/399934/<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0https://freesound.org/people/deleted_user_7146007/sounds/383446/<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0https://freesound.org/people/myrararara/sounds/412799/<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0https://freesound.org/people/kolczok/sounds/198982/<br/>Music:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/tobias_weber/57791<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/Quarkstar/57874<br/>Fonts:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/germania-one-font.html<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/jolly-lodger-font.html</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39bbd2c76eefa2cc70488556e5f6391c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Riymak"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
