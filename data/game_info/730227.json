It was made for Global Game Jam 2022. Since the jam\u2019s rules were a lot more flexible this year I decided to take it easy, so this was completed in about 60 hours instead of 48. (Even so, I didn\u2019t add everything I wanted to add but I am happy that the game is still complete.)</p>\n<p>The jam\u2019s theme was \"Duality\". There is no correct path \u2013 these stories are just brief meditations on life. I hope they make you think about your own life and the infinite number of paths that decisions and choices unlock.</p>\n<p>The game will launch in full screen mode.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mandy J Watson (@mandyjwatson):<br/>Game design, narrative and writing, programming, and art</li>\n<li>Fonts:<br/>Munro by Ten By Twenty (SIL Open Font Licence 1.1); <br/>Nevis by Ten By Twenty (SIL Open Font Licence 1.1); and<br/>Pixel Operator by Jayvee Enaguas/HarvettFox96 (Creative Commons Zero (CC0) 1.0 Universal).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Software Used:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Base64.Guru, <em>GIMP</em>, <em>Notepad</em>, <em>Twine</em>.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T06:51:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/ebaf2a8188f108e6baebdbd58b412e76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mandy J Watson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
