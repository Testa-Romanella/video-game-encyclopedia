Your goals are simply to outrun the falling blocks and not make any wrong turns. The paths are always random, so it's all about focus with nothing to memorize. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>- 6 original music tracks, mostly inspired by Classical music favorites with a modern take.<br/>- Two modes: Hero Mode and Zen Mode, each with different pacing and music tracks.<br/>- Each mode takes about 10 to 20 minutes to beat, with an Endless option at the end.<br/>- The Flawless option makes either mode much harder, allowing no mistakes</p>\n<p>Currently available to play in browser, or to download as an executable for Windows. Also available for Android as a .APK if you're comfortable with that. (Going to try getting it on the Google Play store.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T06:00:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3d/d3d59ff968263f6e71cb6549d03bf736.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["tylerwallis95"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
