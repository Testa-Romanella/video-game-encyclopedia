Think about how the future would have been imagined back in the 1990s when this console was new. Think of the retro movie posters and the games at the time and imagine them 50 years forward. Flying cars, space exploration, living on the moon, visiting other planets, intelligent robots, blasters and mind control, plus many\u00a0other\u00a0wonderful things that were yet to come.\u00a0We're talking about what the 2040s would look like if you were living in the 90s.</em>\n</p>\n<p>This is my itch.io page for the game I submit to the contest.</p>\n<p>It is based on the free print&amp;play tile game\u00a0Cheese Chasers from Bran McMillin.<br/></p>\n<p>In order to fit the contest theme, the game is now about mining asteroids, while avoiding explosions and pirates.</p>\n<p>The Basic mode is based on the original game, while the Easy mode has less tiles, and only need 1 inactivated mine to win.<br/>Plus mode has more tiles but also more options and new tiles (bigger asteroids, hi-probe with hypersace engine, smuggler).</p>\n<p>The game has achievement features, which can unlock assets (backgounds, musics, artworks) or game feature (high score management, Plus mode, Undo, Map).</p>\n<p>It takes advantage of EEprom management in order to save progress after each session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits :</strong></p>\n<p>- Original boardgame : Bran McMillin</p>\n<p>- Code : Fadest, using BLL kit and tools from BS42, M.
