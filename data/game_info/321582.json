There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play.<br/><br/>You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. <br/><br/>If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:39:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bc/7bca33a8e790a4929bc4f38f749ac5e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["HAHOO GAMES"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["HAHOO GAMES"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
