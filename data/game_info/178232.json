With wasd you decide which direction to move and the space button to actually move in that direction. You can PRESS and HOLD space button to just move along the direction key you're holding or just PRESS and RELEASE for a more calculated play style.</p>\n\n<p>--Game--</p>\n<p>You'll be randomly placed in a grid based map along with some green cubes and red cubes. Your goal is to collect the green ones. The red ones actually destroy you and they can move around as you do. Beware, the map itself changes with time !</p>\n<p>You'll be starting with two health, it's only going to go down until the end.</p>\n<p>If you stay still for a long period of time, your cube will explode. So only red cubes and time kills you.</p>\n<p>Play as long as you can and post your score as a comment, i'm curious about the results.</p>\n\n<p>--Bugs--</p>\n<p>There are a couple of them, but the easiest fix is to wait until you die ! It's rogue-like what are the chances of those bugs occuring again and again !?!? *dies*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/836/83610af9d374a4172a22b04ab65dcd78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enlades"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
