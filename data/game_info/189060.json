You were\r\nreading a book then you fell asleep. Suddenly, your headphones start\r\npicking up strange sounds: static, men yelling orders, screams, bones\r\ncracking and finally silence. Then a hole grew and you are sucked into it.<br/></p>\n<p>Things aren't looking too good. You have never been alone in your life.\r\nPlus you don't have your father's guns. If only you could get a hold of a\r\nrapid catapult or a camera gun, you could protect yourself.</p>\n<p>Suddenly a scout boy comes and you stabbed him with a nearby knife. Then\r\nangry growls arose. They know you're here. There's no turning back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff9/ff9a014421730fef6965f401b942ceeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mickey96"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
