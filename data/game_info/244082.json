Play the imitation game, to win!<br/><br/>Not only in English... many languages!<br/><br/><br/>Find an opponent through Game Center, maybe a friend, but always a real person. Say something, and get a reply.<br/><br/>But who or what replied? Was it a bot, or not? It could have been a Cleverbot.<br/><br/>Other players don't know what you are either... especially if you play well.<br/><br/>Fool your friends, and don't be fooled yourself!<br/><br/>One player's gain is another's loss, and you're after the same target.<br/><br/>Be anything but yourself! Imitate, trick, flatter or deceive with your words!<br/><br/>Choose the right moments to have Cleverbot reply for you. The other player will too, leading to crazy, hilarious, unexpected conversations.<br/><br/>Have you heard of Alan Turing? He all but invented computers, but also proposed a test. If a machine, just by talking, could fool people into thinking it is human, it should be called intelligent. Cleverbot is that machine. Cleverbot is the 'third person' in your games. Whether you win or lose, you, your friend and Cleverbot will all be given a Bot Percentage!  <br/><br/>Find out just how human you aren't... at least while playing the game.  The botter the better!<br/><br/>Please note that the things you say via the this app may be logged at any time.
