This is my first attempt at participating in any kind of game jam, and I\u00a0think my submission is very reflective of my current skill level. Although, it only loosely fits the theme and I wasn't able to include many of the features I wanted, I managed to make an enjoyable experience that incorporates the majority of my programming and artistic\u00a0knowledge.</p>\n<p>I am especially proud of the goofy looking monster and the buildings to which it lays waste. I feel I'll be re-using the buildings, and my little brother cracks up every time the monster zips across the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:19:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7db/7db52ecdc20af3342e6992f8887a7617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LemonProphet"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
