You decide to customise and buy a childlike sentient android. Five years of service are included. After that, the android will be free to stay with you or move on. How you treat them will determine whether they stay and what sort of relationship may develop.</p>\n<p>The player character and the android each have a choice of nonbinary, female, or male.<br/></p>\n<p>Some routes contain romantic content but not sexual or graphic content.</p>\n<p>This took me about a year to make. \u00a0I've played it hundreds of times if not thousands, and I had several beta testers (thank you!). I will probably release a few updates if problems are found, but I don't plan to make any major changes to the interface or story. Please let me know if you find bugs or any language errors! Note that spellings are in Canadian English.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing, human!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T14:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c68/c68177e6a27946432418aa8683528364.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["cuterobot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
