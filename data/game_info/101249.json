The code is already in my possession.</em> </p><p>With the coast clear the spy sneaks towards the keypad. <em>Espionage, what a crime. There is so much data, so much worth stealing. I can sell it to the highest bidder; I could blackmail them for more wealth. With the right data in my hands I could crumble empires.</em></p><p>He looked around him. No one was nearby, the security cameras were already deactivated with code he implemented earlier. <em>I have to be quick about it,</em> he decides. <em>The guards will not be gone for long. A small and cold cell in prison sounds far from as luxurious as sipping cocktails on a beach in the Bahama's. </em>Soft laughter erupted but he contained it. This was what he enjoyed. <em>Sixty seconds, in and out. Better not get greedy.</em><br/></p><p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p><p>Game by:<br/>Fredrik Brundin</p><p>Additional Art:<br/>Dominic Buchholz</p><p>Short Story:<br/>Reggie Schildmeijer<br/></p><p>Made for GBJAM 1<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b6/9b6dff5b6287f4c94558057a08a68645.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Momeka"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
