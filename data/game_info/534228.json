Check it here\n\nA fighting game about sword dueling, in which the blades really clash using physics, and the characters use motion captured fencing techniques. Play as one of many 17th century warriors and use sabers, rapiers, broadswords and many other blades in single player campaign, arcade, or local multiplayer with friends.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>physical Sword Fighting using Active Ragdolls\n<br/>\n</li><li>super realistic, motion captured fencing animations\n<br/>\n</li><li>beautiful 3d scanned graphics</li></ul>\n<br/>\nHellish Quart uses active ragdolls and all damage your blade can do is calculated with realtime physics. Four gamepad buttons represent 4 attack angles. Different button combinations give special attacks and combos. If you are not attacking, your character will automatically try to hold guard against your opponent's attacks. The blades really block each other and that's what's keeping you alive. To win, you must use proper timing, measure, technique, speed and wits - just like when fencing in the real world.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHellish Quart has a historical setting. The game takes place in 17th century Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The character models are made using 3D scanned clothes, based on fashion from the period, and the single player campaign (when done!) will be firmly rooted in realities of life in the region. You will duel Zaporozhian Cossacks, Polish Hussars, Tatars, Turkish Janissaries, Swedish Reiters, French Musketeers and more.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T02:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/668/668f95a3cdefe12f21dead4f2e13eca3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 355, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kubold"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Kubold"], "esrb_rating": null}
