{"id": 309476, "slug": "waiting-room-simulator", "name": "Waiting Room Simulator", "name_original": "Waiting Room Simulator", "description": "<p>This is a game I\u00a0made for my final project in the \"Video Games as Literature\" class at Concordia University. The game is inspired by my own experiences in dilapidated commercial spaces nearby my childhood home in Ottawa, Ontario, and how I used to kill time before appointments by exploring these spaces. The goal of my game is to approximate the feeling of memories distorting physical space \u2014 that is to say, to convey the feeling of returning to a space and it being different than the way you remember it. The game heavily emphasizes exploration, and is much more concerned with the journey rather than the destination. I recommend interacting with items,\u00a0NPCs, and environmental details\u00a0as much as possible, as sometimes they provide different responses after an encounter. I also encourage playing the game through multiple times, as there are a few different paths you\u00a0 can take to get to the end kernel. I hope you enjoy exploring my world!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e46cd5684ea4fd5c8894670e0b8aecd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Lecours"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
