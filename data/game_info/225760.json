You may have noticed there was no game last week - I decided not to make a game during the mid semester break, and took time to work on other projects instead. Regardless, here is a new game! The theme was physics this week so I decided to explore an odd medium for physics (not using a physics engine for a game themed around physics! woah) and explore the emotion and tension physics can enhance. Hope you enjoy! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2feaac92cad04e7b54e506f03b7b7dc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
