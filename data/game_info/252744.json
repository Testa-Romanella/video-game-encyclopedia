You play as a creature yanked from another dimension and dropped into an industrial wasteland full of other alien lifeforms. You leap and cling through the environment to find ectoplasm to power yourself up, allowing you to temporarily fly. You explore, interact with unique creatures and collect nutrient to sprout alien plants and sabotage force fields blocking your path. You trigger floods of ectoplasm, transforming the dead environment into a vibrant and flourishing alien ocean. We want our gameworld to feel truly weird, with visuals drawing off tide-pools, deep sea life and and microorganisms. Only trace amounts of a more familiar world remain in this setting, buried beneath years of accumulated strangeness.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d8/3d86139652110af63a1348f59fe597a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NateSpence"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
