Just a few hours before the deadline, I posted my entry for the 49th LudumDare - Take Your Meds Darling. This is a weird trip inside a mentally unstable soul. You have to find red pills in levels so as to progress into rooms. Each of them reveals some secrets, changing the environment allowing you to go forward. I used many materials shaders and camera effects so as to create a strange mood. So respectfully this game is not suitable for those who have some photoepileptic sensibility. Play with headphones in order to enjoy ambient sounds. This project has been inspired by games like Antichamber, Manifold Garden, 0\u00b0N 0\u00b0W, Fragments Of Euclid, Rouge Noir and more...</p>\n<p><strong>This game is not suitable for those who have some photoepileptic sensibility.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>How to play :</em></p>\n<p><em>Use WASD to move and SPACE to jump</em></p>\n<p><em>Use Mouse Buttons so as to interact with some elements in game</em></p>\n<p><em>Escape to load Menu - R to restart...<br/></em></p>\n\n<p>PS : with the kind permission of TheNusan, I added a game launcher in the package so as to change game settings - graphics quality and monitor resolution. It works like the old Unity Launcher.
