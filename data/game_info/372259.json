Can you solve the mystery?\r\n<br/>Cowpocalypse \u00a0is a puzzle filled, Point &amp; Click style adventure game.\r\n<p>You can discover the mysteries and solve the puzzles by interacting with objects and talking to characters. Episode 1 is about 1-2 hours long, and serves as an introduction to the world which will be further explained in the second (=last) episode\u00a0which will probably be 3-4 hours long.</p>\n\r\nStory\r\n<p>When\u00a0Bran\u00a0is woken up\u00a0by a loud\u00a0noise at the middle of the night,\u00a0he has to discover\u00a0that a reindeer is stuck inside his bedroom roof. It turns out that the animal is called\u00a0Rudolf\u00a0and belongs to\u00a0Santa, who is also there at the backyard.<br/></p>\n<p>Besides the strange visitors, there is a more urgent problem that needs to be solved.\u00a0Bran is responsible to look after the family's cows,\u00a0while his parents are away for the weekend. The problem is that\u00a0the cows dissapeared.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Where did Santa and Rudolf came from? How did the cows escape? Are these\u00a0strange things connected somehow? Could Bran find out what's going on and\u00a0get the cows\u00a0back in time?</p>\n\r\nEpisode 2\n<p>****</p><p>UPDATE: it won't happen :(<br/></p>\n<p>It's a really depressing feeling that after a huge ammount of preparation it turns out that I can't start a campaign from my country, Hungary.</p>\n<p>It shocked me, because the last time I checked I was on the eligable list (about 1 year ago). I don't know if Indiegogo updated their policy since then, or I was reading an outdated info before. In any case, I can't really do anything about it. I'm sorry that I made you guys excited and now I let you down. Believe me, it's a horrible news for me too.\u00a0<br/><br/>I believe that honesty is the best way to go. So here it is: without support I can't make Episode 2, so it surely won't happen in the near future. I hope that in the distant future I could start working on it, because I really enjoyed the development, but it's out of my sight for now.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the positive feedback I got for the game so far! I whish the best for everyone and that your dreams come true!</p><p>****</p><p>The second episode is not done yet. It will be the same style of game as the previous one with about 3-4 hours of gameplay.\u00a0The development however really expensive and the first episode is free too, so I'm out of my resources. I can't contunue without help, so I decided to start an Indiegogo campaign. With\u00a0 a sucessful\u00a0crowdfunding campaign, I will be able to finish the second (and last) Episode!\u00a0</p>\n\r\nSo I need your help! If you found Episode 1 interesting enough, support the project on Indiegogo!\r\n\n<p>For more info:</p>\n<p>Email: creativecyle@gmail.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-24T21:54:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa6/fa61cc9cb8cdeca4118e89d5c709cd06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ccyle"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
