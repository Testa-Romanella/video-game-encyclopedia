You control the direction in which the clot moves. White blood cells destroy some molecules, and \u2018malignant\u2019 ones stick to your molecule. Slowly everything starts getting faster. The clot will get bigger, and if the blood stops flowing you will lose. Scoring is based on the number of cells that pass through.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f394778e19db3d77486dec98608b61c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mikeesp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
