I couldn\u2019t find it in any of the classic Pico-8 game guides, so it\u2019s probably a bootleg.</p>\n<p>I ripped the ROM (since my old Pico-8 system hasn\u2019t worked in ages), and I figured I\u2019d share it here since one of you guys must know about these obscure cartridges. I can\u2019t tell if it the game is corrupted or if that\u2019s how it\u2019s meant to be.</p>\n<p>Enjoy! Multiple endings, surrealist horror, and a bumping soundtrack (available for free download here).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c4/7c441106828f88423ff76ec654ed0631.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Simon Hutchinson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
