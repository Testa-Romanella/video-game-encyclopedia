It's just you, some nice space, and a ball. Test out the main character, <strong>Hero</strong>! Aim for a high score, and\u00a0share with the community on the <strong>itch.io thread</strong>!</p>\r\nGame rules:\r\n<p>You start the game with the ball in your front and 3 points of health. When the ball passes the\u00a0<strong>DANGER</strong> line, a health point will be deducted. When you reach 0 health, it's <strong>Game Over</strong>!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every time you hit the ball, you get more points. The ball also speeds up, so be careful! But don't be afraid of it: the faster the ball is when you hit it, more points will be added to your total. Get on it's face and show it no mercy!</p>\n<p>If the ball is overwhelmingly fast, don't fret - use the <strong>Block</strong> maneuver to stop the ball in it's tracks and aim your shot carefully. However, you need to spend <strong>Super Meter</strong> to do so. You build up some meter every time you hit the ball - keep up a combo, and the meter acquired per hit increases! Don't be afraid to block every so often!</p>\r\nControls - Keyboard:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow Key Up/W - </strong>Move Up</li><li><strong>Arrow Key Down/S</strong><strong> - </strong>Move Down</li><li><strong>Z/J - </strong>Attack</li><li><strong>X/K -</strong> Block</li></ul>\r\nControls - Game pad:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Directional Pad Up/Left Stick Up - </strong>Move Up</li><li><strong>Directional Pad Down</strong><strong>/Left Stick Down - </strong>Move Down\r\n</li><li><strong>Down/Left Face Button- </strong>Attack\r\n</li><li><strong>Right/Up Face Button -</strong> Block</li></ul>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>There are three attacks in PongMeister: a <strong>neutral attack</strong>, performed by pressing Attack with no direction; an Up attack, performed by pressing Up + Attack; and - you guessed it - a Down attack, done by pressing Down + Attack.</p>\n<p>Blocking can be done from any movement and position, as long as you have the meter (1 stock) for it.</p>\r\nFeedback:\r\n<p>As a prototype, the game is available for free. While you can do whatever you want with your money, the <strong>only thing</strong> I ask you to give me in return is <strong>feedback</strong>, either on the forums or on the comments down below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the first game I am ever releasing, and as such it <em>will</em> have corners of inconvenience I am still ironing out. If you like the idea of the game, if you dislike anything about it - I will be listening to it, and you may help shape up the development of PongMeister down the line.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>PongMeister - the Squash Alpha is created by:</p>\n<p>Design, Artwork, Programming, Sound Effects and Voice - Kaiden (@kaidentbio)</p>\n<p>Music is <em>\"UB-E 4 (Drums &amp; Synths 100BPM)\"</em> by Jordan \"Erokia\" Powell from Freesound.org - Check out his Soundcloud!</p>\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\n<p>Mom and Dad, for putting up with me;</p>\n<p>Kaian-a-coel, Critzy and Sinful Horns, for being the chumps that are always pushing me to do the best I can;<br/></p>\n<p>The Gamemaker Studio 2 Discord server, for always providing assistance when in need;</p>\n<p>The many GameMaker Studio 2 content creators, for letting me learn about this magical little engine.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T09:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/705/70552fa73f85f43324c6ada0e89f52f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaiden"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
