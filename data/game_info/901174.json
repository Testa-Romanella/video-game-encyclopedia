Developed in about three weeks by my little solo-dev self\u00a0for the Secret Santa Game Jam. My giftee enjoys platformers and games that blend genres and game mechanics. I was inspired by the puzzle, ghost-hunting adventures of Phasmophobia and cute, retro platformers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As of the first release (12/23/22) there's only one possible option, but updates may come! There's still a lot on the back end of game development I'm learning, but I\u00a0hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Game and art developed by Laurie Noel. Music by Mr. V.</p>\n<p>If you experience any bugs please let me know!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Enjoyed what I\u00a0made?\u00a0Say thanks with a ko-fi.
