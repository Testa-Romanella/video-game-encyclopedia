The development of the game was stopped by the company <strong>Lankhor </strong>in <strong>1992</strong> and we decided to make an experiment. Is this type of investigate games with voice synthesis possible on Megadrive ?<br/></p>\n<p>All ressources (HUD, characters, picture ) were available on the net. Also all dialogues (in french), scenarios but without the chronological sequence.\r\n</p>\n<p>At the beginning of June, we decided to show our work through a video on our channel youtube ..and it was the Buzz.. We did not think he still had a community around this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>June 16th, Mr <strong>Lan</strong>glois (founder of <strong>Lan</strong>khor company) asks us for explanations on this port and asks us not to continue for the moment on the Megadrive.\r\n</p>\n<p>Yes, <strong>1/4 of a Century later</strong>, we can not give life to this unreleased game.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But the reason is valid, a new version of Maupiti Island is being crowdfunded and if successful, <strong>Sukiya</strong>should see the light of day. To avoid reveal the story, we have to wait for a version of the new generation game before doing not the remake but the original work of 1992.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Original\u00a0concept game by\u00a0: Lankhor\r\n\u00a0Plateform\u00a0: ATARI ST / AMIGA OCS\r\n\u00a0Game design\u00a0:\u00a0 Sylvian Bruchon<br/>\r\n\u00a0Graphic Artist\u00a0:\u00a0Stephane Polard", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T05:09:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b63/b638cfaaf264b29383bad91c38d47e4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Z-team"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
