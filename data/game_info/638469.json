You\u00a0 play as a worker\u00a0from an energy company in the year 2025, where the CO2 emission has risen to a critical level. Your job is to\u00a0use CCS to reduce CO2 in built up Areas. We set out for this game to be a unique experience that teaches the concepts of carbon capture storage in a fun way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If we were chosen to take this game further this is a list of stuff we would add:</p>\n<p>- Overall Polish ( From 4 day demo to polished prototype)</p>\n<p>- Optimization Such As Occlusion Culling</p>\n<p>- More Locations To Balance</p>\n<p>- More Gameplay mechanics</p>\n<p>- Animations</p>\n<p>- More Technical Inclusions Further Detailing The Process Of Carbon Capture Storage + Interactable Underground Proccesses / More Educational Content.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0More Ways To Alter Fix The Environments (E.g Regenerating Ecosystems, building bigger carbon capture unit at first.</p>\n<p>- Full Tutorial</p>\n<p>-Bug Fixes</p>\n<p>- The game is extremely adaptable so any requests from the client in terms of changes can be easily incorporated into the idea.
