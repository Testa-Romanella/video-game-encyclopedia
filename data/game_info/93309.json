Their friends, their families, their loved ones. A melting pot of normality, small-town Americana, the smell of barbecues and freshly-cut grass. Stale sweat and the sickly sweet taste of non-alcoholic punch. Graduation plans, walks in the forest, making out at the Observatory. Death, betrayal and murder. No life is normal. No childhood is easy. No transition is smooth. </p><p>Growing up can be a killer. </p><p>Set in the same universe as The Charnel House Trilogy and Bright Lights &amp; Glass Houses, The Prom King (and other stories) is a tale of death and discovery with a sharp, wicked edge. </p><p><strong>Warning: This game contains scenes of explicit nudity, trauma and violence that some may find disturbing.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5a/a5a8a3481e9ffcc70a3b1829f139d10e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Olivia White"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
