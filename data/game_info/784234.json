If you are below or over that, you get no points. If you get exactly 100%, you get<strong> DOUBLE points! </strong>This game tests your accuracy, reflexes and speed at the same time. Your time is limited at 30 seconds.<br/></p>\n<p>Try to get the best score possible and share it on the social media.</p>\n<p>More geometry shapes can be added in future updates.
