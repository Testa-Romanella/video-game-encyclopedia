The aim of the game is to access all profiles on the machine by exploiting security flaws and making use of in-game journals left by the previous users. <br/></p>\n<p>VSCS-I has a main story mode, as well as three challenge packs that can be unlocked after the story is completed. Please note that progress will not be saved if you leave this page.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, be aware that using resources (ex: the internet) outside of the game is <strong>not cheating</strong>, and is in fact required.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>VSCS-I was developed as a final project for the spring 2020 semester of CPSC 329.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>All interactions with the VSCS-I are done via the command line. Type text into the input field in the bottom left of the screen and press enter to submit a command.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Navigation through the file system is done via the OPEN, LIST, and BACK commands. If you don't know where to start, type HELP, then press enter. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hints/Help<br/></strong><br/>For more detailed help, check the Guide/Walkthrough, which can be downloaded below. VSCS-I can be fully completed without the walkthrough, but one puzzle in particular requires access to a search engine. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T02:47:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/baa/baac20ad834a569193751440a593dc9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Oliver Morrish"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
