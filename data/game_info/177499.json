Death angels surround you and can be vanquished with your Assault rifle mode. While the launcher will break the magical locks that tie you to the level. How will the Watcher judge your play? Mostly thought up at a Babymetal concert first day of the jam. Just wanted to make something quick and weird.</p>\n<p>Made solo by Juan Rubio. Particle FX and some sound effects from Ballistic FX in Unreal Marketplace. Rocks/Bricks and a wind sound from the Soul Cave. All code\u00a0(based on FPS template), characters, animation, lookdev, and design done during Jam time.\u00a0Proprietary FACS based rigging tool that is internal to Yanki.jp was used for rigging the characters. Music was slapped together in FLStudio during the jam using some assets from Primeloops.\u00a0Only could work on it for a couple of days due to prior commitments.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08d5f3611888c4ffb0222986ffeab940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yankijp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
