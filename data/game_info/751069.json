I learned a lot there and most of it isn't actually visible in these small prototypes.</p>\n<p>What I might have learned:</p>\n<ul><li>Creating the base for a platformer game</li><li>Character controllers</li><li>Animations &amp; animation states</li><li>Creating a text adventure through code alone</li><li>Creating IK and Spine Unity animations and bones for sprites (due to licensing not included in this playable build)</li><li>Creating Cinemashine and cursor following action</li><li>Stuff with TextMeshPro</li><li>And a lot of things not visible in the actual gameplay that happened in the background</li><li>~Particles~</li><li>Coding sound effects</li><li>Working with the new and the old input system</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Most of the images are made by myself, though, the sprites for the platformer are from Bayat Games (free asset), some sprites are from the Fungus Unity extension examples and the code of the blending test was taken from Angela He's GitHub.</p>\n<p>The music is CC0 and taken from Freesound.org.</p>\r\nControls &amp; Other things\r\nThere will most likely be bugs, since nothing here is refined.\r\n<p>The platformer is controlled with WASD and Space to jump, the text adventure is controlled with 1, 2, 3 and Q (restart). All scenes can be switched by hitting U at any point.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T06:28:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06e8c6053972eb619ab71bf9106502c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tanija"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
