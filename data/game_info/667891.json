The guild has sent you as you are the best of the best, and they are confident you will solve the mysteries of the island. Throughout your journey, you will encounter many difficult trials and you will\u00a0have to manage your time and resources carefully. However, there will also be many people you will meet, and interact, that may or may not help you in your mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspirations and plans</strong></p>\n<p>To start off,\u00a0this game is my very first attempt at making a fully completed video game. I have never done anything like this before, and this game, to me, is a great achievement.</p>\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by other famous JRPGs such as persona and Octopath traveler. I have always been a fan of games about time management and having the player do whatever they want, so I really tried to make something close to that.</p>\n<p>The game currently is in its prototyping stage, and there are still many plans I really want to finish. An example would be actually making original art for the game. Due to lack of time, I\u00a0can't afford to take my time in creating assets for the game, however, if I find that it is absolutely necessary, I will attempt to make some original assets for the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T04:16:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b100520a3b053c262843142b1ac4be3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wasome02"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
