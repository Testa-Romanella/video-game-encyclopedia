But that's not the case for an unlikely friendship between a penguin and an owl. Explore snowy environments and solve puzzles by using the unique movement provided by a flightless bird and its soaring counterpart!</p>\n\n<p>This is a two-player split-screen experience! We recommend playing together, but online applications, like Parsec, will also work. Or go dual controllers! Two input devices are required, one for each player. This can be Keyboard &amp; Mouse + a controller or two controllers.</p>\n\n<p>--- Controls ---<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Penguin</strong></p>\n<strong>Move</strong>WASD / Left Analog Stick<br/><strong>Jump</strong>\u00a0(With\u00a0Owl Perched)Space / Gamepad South<br/><strong>Slide/Dive </strong>(While\u00a0Moving, Owl\u00a0Not\u00a0Perched)Shift / Gamepad East<br/><strong>Toggle\u00a0Bow</strong>E / Gamepad West<br/><strong>Charge\u00a0Bow</strong>Left Click / Right Trigger<br/><strong>Fire\u00a0Bow</strong>\u00a0(After\u00a0Charging\u00a0Bow)Release Left Click / Right Trigger<br/><strong>Open\u00a0Door</strong>Left Click / Right Trigger<br/>\n<p><strong>Owl</strong></p>\n<strong>Fly</strong>WASD / Left Analog Stick<br/><strong>Take\u00a0Off\u00a0</strong>(From\u00a0Perch)Space / Gamepad South<br/><strong>Flutter\u00a0</strong>(At Apex\u00a0of\u00a0Jump/After\u00a0Penguin\u00a0lets\u00a0go\u00a0of\u00a0Jump)Shift / Gamepad East<br/>\n<p>--- Credits ---<br/></p>\n<strong>Mike\u00a0Farley</strong>3D\u00a0Artist\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Animator<strong>Chad\u00a0Van\u00a0Patten</strong>3D Artist &amp; Animator<br/><strong>Kend'or\u00a0Wilson</strong>Game Design, Level Design, &amp; Sounds<br/><strong>Charles\u00a0Reverand</strong>Programming, UI, &amp; Environment<br/>\n<p>Created in one month!
