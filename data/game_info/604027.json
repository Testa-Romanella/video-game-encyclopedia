In the game, you must learn and type the presented Japanese characters to proceed.<h3>Japanese Writing System</h3>The Japanese writing system is composed of Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Instead of A to Z, Hiragana letters range from \u3042 (a) to \u3093 (n). Katakana will also range from \u30a2 (a) to \u30f3 (n). You will use the English equivalent (Romaji) to type these letters.
