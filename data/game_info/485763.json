The only difference was that I adjusted/removed a few colliders to make it build successfully.<br/></p>\n<p>I attempted challenges Extra Historian, Extra Distance and Extra Retro from the EC Game Jam #6.<br/></p>\n<p>All assets were made by me during the duration of the Jam. The scripts borrow some code from the Unity tutorial Ruby's Adventure 2D.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first completed/published game. I hope you like it !<br/></p>\n<p>P.S. I didn't have time for sound. I'll try to add it soon. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T04:33:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0b9abaac9271a63bd28b57daddc4e53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Renderererer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
