Make any kind of game you like,\u00a0as long as it fits the <strong>People's Committee of Game Developments </strong>agenda.<br/></p>\n<p>You are tasked to develop\u00a0a game in a socialist state. Your game has to be well liked by the party, and the people. Pick <strong>workers</strong>,<strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>hardware</strong>, <strong>genres</strong>, <strong>themes</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>propaganda</strong>\u00a0that will uniquely shape your game. As your options for these categories are limited with what the party has to offer, try to form the best combination. Earn titles that give you unique improvements for your newer games, and try to make better games as the expectations grow larger.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Credits:</p><ul><li>Doruk Hasdogan -Art &amp; Design-</li><li>Ece Seyrek Hasdogan -Art &amp;\u00a0Design-</li><li>Yarkin D.
