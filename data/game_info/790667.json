After shopping, more asteroids will appear.</p>\n<p>Upcoming Patches:</p>\n<p>Basic Animation v.1 - Add explosion for asteroids, Show planet taking damage.</p>\n<p>Maintenance v.1 - Weapons eventually degrade over time, requiring repair. With each repair, it will cost more to fully repair that weapon.\u00a0 \u00a0When the planet takes damage, weapons might also take damage. (This is to hopefully keep the game a bit more dynamic)</p>\n<p>Weapon Upgrades Purchasable v.2 - Beyond just buying weapons with random stats and upgrades can now purchase mods to help improve current weapons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Infrastructure v.3 - Buy buildings to help defend the plant or make more profits. It could also be the weapon upgrades are made in the infrastructure.</p>\n<p>World Map v.3 -&gt; a way of seeing where all your stuff is at = ).</p>\n<p>(I think it would be really cool to have a 3D world to place the buildings on. The above will be a simple 2D map)</p>\n<p>Events v.4 - Special Events can occur by adjusting the playthrough.</p>\n<p>After v.4 it will be time to review if I should spend any more time developing/updating this game this will really be up to the player's interest and if the game is fun.</p>\n<p>Far future ideas:</p>\n<p>Items</p>\n<p>Satellites -&gt; can increase vision by giving earlier warning</p>\n<p>Asteroid Miners -&gt; will collect resources from asteroids.</p>\n<p>Battle Ships -&gt;Like little mini planets can be moved once at the start of the round.</p>\n<p>Aliens -&gt; don't just run into the planet but will shoot from a distance, targeting weapons and defensive structures.</p>\n<p>Bugs! -&gt; Astroids could contain bugs that, between levels, you will have to do turn-based actions with ground forces to defeat</p>\n<p>Design Ideas</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing my game. I hope you enjoyed it. This is an early concept prototype. If you like the idea/concept, please comment I love to hear your opinions. Your voice will be heard and seen in incremental improvements. My plan is to make quick games like this to improve my skills and also test out ideas. I hope to take games like this and apply a couple of patches if people are enjoying the game I will add more updates. If people love the game then I might invest in actually making it a polished game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T11:49:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a91/a91f0fabef91ead1df6c5784045bb4d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Game Wave Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
