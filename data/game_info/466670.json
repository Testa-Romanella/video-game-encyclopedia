With little hope for survival you make a run for the internet. Can you glitch your way out of the simulation?</p>\n<p>You have limited control over your character. And although glitches can get you out of tricky situations, you never know what's going to happen. Everything given, can also be taken away.\u00a0So be prepared for anything! The game won't tell you which glitches are active, so it's up to you to keep track of that.</p>\n<p>There's no health in this game. You get impaled, you die.\u00a0To ensure you got through the levels based on skill, you'll be set back one level when you die. So that when you die, you'll have to prove you finished the previous level through skill alone.</p>\n<p>This game is my submission for the GMTK GameJam 2020, and my first completed game in PICO-8. The code is a mess, the controls finicky, and missing a lot of other glitches I\u00a0had hoped to implement, but hopefully it gives you an idea of what could've been.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:34:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce5/ce523d469f6ec83cccd4fd0bd87e6232.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["michaeldejong"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
