When he wakes up, he doesn't know if he's still dreaming or fully awake. He can only check around his house to find if everything's on place. If he decides to go to work while sleeping or to get back to sleep when he was already awake, he'll lose his job. The only option he has is to make sure that his house is as found.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0@Mysterious_Hat</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>MUSIC AND SOUND</strong></p>\n<p>Luis Alejo (@luis__alejo)</p>\n\r\nCODE AND ART\r\n\n<p>Dani Carco (@dcarcov)\r\n</p>\r\nVOICE\r\n<p>David Santos</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:10:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5e/b5e5be171d8692a79b406bf872eb24cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mysterious Hat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
