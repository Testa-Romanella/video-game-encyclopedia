Scientists on Earth\u2019s new artificial moon have detected a signal coming from deep space, it is not human\u2026   Frantically trying to discover the source of this signal, Earth\u2019s top minds discover a message embedded in the signal, a declaration of war! Orbital satellites find a massive force on a trajectory to the Sol system. How will we defend against this? We have no weapons.\r\n  Scientists begin retrofitting 2 ancient space fighters, code-named Sword and Spear, housed in the Capitol Museum with the newest technology and advanced weapons they can create and begin production on a 3rd ship known as The Spartan, a prototype dual weapon fighter with the capabilities of both Sword and Spear models.\r\n  These ships will be known as Phalanx.\r\n  Setting off from Earth just days from the enemy armada, our only hope is these ships and their brave pilots.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0CONTROLS\r\n  In-Game pause: Esc\r\n  </p>\n<p>*Single Player*\r\n  </p>\n<p>Movement: W, S, A, D\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Fire Green Laser: C\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Fire Red Laser: V\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0*Multiplayer*</p>\n<p>P1 Movement: W, S, A, D\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Fire Red Laser: C\r\n  </p>\n<p>P2 Movement: Arrow Keys\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Fire Green Laser: M\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24f/24f2509e158aeda1c4371ee31793b0b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noel Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
