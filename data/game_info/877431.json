Tip: If you placed a block by accident, you can paint over it with another block! this also means layering. If i will see people are interested in this game then I would add more blocks! comment what blocks you will want and I will try to include them!</p>\n<p>Music credits:</p>\n<p>\"Air Hockey Saloon\" by Chris Zabriskie https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T14:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c8/6c8bdfe9f1e2efb2461964884d174002.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mr Craft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
