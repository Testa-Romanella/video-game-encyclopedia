The  aim is to go around the room and finish all the tasks without losing (which is if you damage  too many objects in the room). The challenge is you have to keep both  the rhythm of your breathe and the key presses. Didn't externally play test it so not  100% sure but I feel like it does add a bit of challenge.\r\n </p>\n<p>If you look at the code and wonder \"Why the hell did he program this  like this?\" It is because I was rushing and when there is rush there is  no logic so stuff's just kinda haphazardly thrown together towards the end. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The controls are listed in game but I forgot to put in the key for running so:</p>\n<p>- Hold Left Mouse button to breathe in</p>\n<p>- Press E to interact with the task</p>\n<p>- Hold down Left Shift to sprint</p>\n\n<p>If you're feelin' SPICY the source code can be found at my Github:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Geniye1/LD48JustBreathe/tree/1.0.0<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:33:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bb/8bbb505757af1628b79226d51fcb1aa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Genyie"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
