Triggered by the device, a mechanism is activated and the hammer may be released, leading to the breaking of the vial and potential harm to the cat.<br/><br/>Until you dare to open the box, the cat exists in this fantastical state where it's both alive and dead at the same time. So, embrace the madness, my little one, as we venture into the quantum circus of uncertainty!<h3>Features:</h3><br/><ul><li>9 levels with different kinds of puzzles<br/></li><li>+ 1 hidden hardcore level<br/></li><li>Enchanting pixel art<br/></li><li>8-bit soundtrack<br/></li><li>Thrilling action sequences<br/></li><li>Clever and funny puzzles<br/></li><li>Cats being cats</li></ul><h3>Controls:</h3><br/><ul><li>Directional keys: \u2b06, \u2b05, \u2b07, \u27a1 / W, A, S, D <br/></li><li>Action: E<br/></li><li>Meow: M<br/></li><li>Restart level: Z</li></ul><br/>Dead or alive?
