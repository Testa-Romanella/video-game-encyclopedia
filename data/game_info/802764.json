Play as chubby Kittey trying to foil the plan of an evil mastermind in A Game with a Kitty 1, or help the Archchancellor solve the mystery of Princess Daphodil's lost crown in Darkside Adventures. Or play as Marvin and uncover the dark secrets of an island with super high treasure potential.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>These games are retro 2d platformers with a focus on exploration. As you play, you'll learn new moves that'll let you find new places and treasures, even in previously visited levels. Run &amp; hat-glide with Kittey in A Game with a Kitty 1 or wall-run with the Archchancellor in Darkside Adventures. Numerous bosses are waiting to be challenged, too! Same goes for Marvin in THM1!<br/><br/>What are you waiting for? Grab these moneybags and thoroughly kick some (evil) koala butt!<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Retro pixel graphics at a VERY low resolution<br/>\n</li><li>Two 2d platformers in one package<br/>\n</li><li>Partially non-linear gameplay structure with light metroidvania touches<br/>\n</li><li>Kinda hard (sorry)<br/>\n</li><li>Saving &amp; level selection maps<br/>\n</li><li>Gain new skills as you progress through these 2 adventures<br/>\n</li><li>Ending variations in Darkside Adventures<br/>\n</li><li>A Game with a Kitty is relatively short (1-2 hours), but Darkside Adventures can take you much longer to complete<br/>\n</li><li>Completely free (you can support me by buying my other games if you like)<br/>\n</li><li>Amazing soundtrack by Sean Cameron (thank you)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In both games, hitting Backspace or double-clicking will activate windowed mode.
