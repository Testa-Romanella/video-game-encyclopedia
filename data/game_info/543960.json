If you spend long enough with this game (for example playtesting (help me)), you quickly come to look for the patterns, rather than actually solve the puzzles.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Esc to pause/unpause and close other tabs</li><li>Left-click for a wide, spread out firing pattern</li><li>Right-click for a narrow firing pattern</li><li>Left-click puzzle tiles to swap their colour</li></ul>\n\r\nThe puzzle\r\n<p>In order to kill an enemy, you have to first complete a puzzle. The rules are quite simple,\u00a0 you can click on a tile to swap its colour, and the puzzle is solved when:</p>\n<ul><li>There is at least one white tile on the board</li><li>Every white tile has an even number of yellow neighbour tiles, including diagonals</li><li>Every white tile has at least one yellow neighbour tile</li></ul>\n<p>There's a mode in the game that will give you a random puzzle, so you can fiddle about with it to try and understand it more. After all, the best way to experience something is to understand it.</p>\r\n\r\nWhy the puzzles?\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the puzzles are timed. If you fail to solve a puzzle in time, then the enemy won't die and in fact, will regain half of its health back. It's in your interest then not to mess these up.</p>\n\r\nScoring\r\n<p>You gain points by:</p>\n<ul><li>Killing an enemy</li><li>Quickly solving a puzzle</li></ul>\n<p>You lose points by:</p>\n<ul><li>Taking damage</li><li>Failing to solve a puzzle</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T08:21:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/8932b892902ff65efc62a98a5cad96b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Doveon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
