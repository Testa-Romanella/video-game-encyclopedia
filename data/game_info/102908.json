Determined to prove it was a mistake and captured the real culprit behind it, the team started their own investigation.</p>\r\nCharacters\r\n\n<p><strong>Anya Lyre</strong></p>\n<p>The leader of the team. Cool-headed and responsible, though there are a few times where she takes a reckless and risky decision. Rather than a \"pure leader\", Anya acts more like a big sister figure for the others. Her unusual knowledge and shady information resources raise suspicion even from her teammates.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Ulm Thornman</strong></p>\n<p>The thinker. He\u00a0has an extraordinary skill in measuring and memorizing various things from cake recipe to Dust serial numbers. Despite of his low self-esteem, Ulm's skill with his crossbow is remarkable.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rhodo Manthus J.</strong></p>\n<p>The muscle of team AURM.\u00a0Living up the stereotype of the strong guy in the team, Rhodo is a slow-thinker and simple-minded.\u00a0Rhodo has a constant dispute with Mei due to Mei\u2019s habit of scolding him for trivial matters, but the two can work together very well in combat.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mei Schnee</strong></p>\n<p>The last member and the ace of team AURM.\u00a0Mei comes from Schnee family who is known as the founder and owner of Schnee Dust Company, the biggest Dust mining, refinery, and distributor in the world.
