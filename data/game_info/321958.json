The objective of the game is to feed the monster plant the blue mushrooms in the field so that it can grow to a Monster Plant. The monster plant needs to be watered with your water can before the time runs out. Press space to refill the water can in the well, and F to water the monster plant. This is my first Game Jam submission. A game done in a week I'm still amazed.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d4338cfe9c2d99e7543c8cbdaf0507a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["migcreatesgames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
