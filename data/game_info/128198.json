Please notify me if you see any bugs or errors so I\u00a0can correct them in the full version. Nothing is currently set in stone so this demo may be extremely different from the full game.)</em></p>\n<p>This is a Saimatsu heavy fangame of Danganronpa V3, where everyone attends Hope's Peak Academy together. Think of it like an extended version of the Ultimate Hope Plan, yeah?\u00a0(And think of this game all together as a different sort of fanfiction.)</p>\n<p>Demo currently runs about 20-30 minutes playtime. The full release is planned to be at least four hours or more.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out this game! If you wanna talk to me more about this project or Danganronpa, you can message me at @icyleaves on Twitter. I'm always open to comments, concerns, or ideas. I\u00a0will occasionally be posting progress reports as well. Since I'm only a high school student, there is no promises on a full release date. (Although I am hoping to get this finished by the end of 2018!)</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:\u00a0I claim to own nothing but the dialogue and story within this visual novel. Sprites, backgrounds, and music are owned by Spike Chunsoft.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09a9e3fcfe1b1ab068770b9ddbe41860.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zoe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
