The main features are implemented, but\u00a0many still need refinement and will be improved in the near future (i.e. Machines, windmills,\u00a0glider, sail, combat and storm system). Other systems are simply not present at the moment (i.e.\u00a0farming, animals, cooking, alchemy, corruption and titans).</p>\n<p>The art of the demo is not final. Some elements are clearly placeholders (i.e. the character,\u00a0glider, sails and windmills) and there is a lot of work to do on the VFX side (especially for the\u00a0clouds). However, we are aiming for the semi-realistic and dynamic art style you can see so far.</p>\r\nYour goal\r\n<p>Stranded on a floating island, your goal is to sail toward the eye of the hurricane. You will\u00a0need to gather resource to craft tools and machines, in order to build building and sails to move\u00a0your island. Once you manage to pass the first storm wall, you can consider the demo finished.</p>\n<p>The experience should take you about 20 min if you know what you are doing, and could take\u00a0over an hour if you enjoy your stay and take your time building and exploring.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Playable with Keyboard and mouse, or with a controller, you will find the control scheme in\u00a0the Option menu.\u00a0As a sandbox survival game, Aloft is meant to be discovered trough exploration and\u00a0experimentation. The controls and mechanism are simple and intuitive, just try anything!</p>\r\nCheat codes\r\n<p>You can alter certain aspects of the game, and get free resource, using cheat code.\u00a0<strong>Press F1</strong> to open a menu with various options available.</p>\n\r\nWhy contribute?\r\n<p> This contribution is fully optional, and you understand this is not a final game and only a demo at this point. However, if you give a contribution to this demo, your donation would go directly to the game development and show your support to the team.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nTell us what you think!\r\n<p>Aloft is still really early in the development and we'd love to hear what you think of the game and the demo.
