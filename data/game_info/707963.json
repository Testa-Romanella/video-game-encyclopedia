It'll be quiet, it'll be peaceful! No drawbacks!!\r\n<p>Wizard's Sanctum is a fast-paced and dynamic first-person shooter centered around exactly one boss battle and no other encounters. It was made for the 7-day FPS jam (so, I made it in a week). It's a big departure from my usually-peaceful offerings, so... heads up regarding that!</p>\n<p>If you really enjoy this kind of minimalist movement-centric arena shooter gameplay, could I point you toward Devil Daggers, a really neat game which I used as a bit of a design touchstone while making this.</p>\n<p><em>For people who like seeing others be self-indulgent: in my head this is a canonical sequel to Wizard's Tower, which is a cute pen and paper roll-and-write about completing a ritual, about as far from this as you can possibly get in terms of gameplay. But maybe a wizard gets up to more than one tone of experience. People live complex lives, you know?<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:24:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/365/3651338d8681c2595fee85ed83310bbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["McLean"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
