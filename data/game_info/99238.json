It\u00b4s on hold for now, because I wanted to focus on a different game (<strong>Error Ware 2</strong>).</p><p>But I thought it\u00b4s still fun enough for my first game jam, so feel free to try it!</p><p>Just be aware that there are some bugs and not that many levels.</p><p>The game has <strong>3 different game modes</strong>:</p>Story mode (1 Player)<p>Well not that much of a story here, at least there\u00b4s a worldmap and a few stages. You earn money depending on how <em>cool</em> your stunts are.</p>Vs. Mode (2 Players locally)<p>You can go head-to-head via splitscreen. Same levels as the Story mode, but in a fixed order. Both players have to clear the stage to get to the next one.</p>Battle Mode (2-4 player locally)<p>This is almost a whole different game with a <strong>top-down perspective</strong>! Think of Mario Kart\u00b4s battle mode but from a bird\u00b4s eye view, with a variety of items and an annoying zooming camera. Probably the most fun if you actually have friends to play it with.</p>Some tips &amp; tricks<ul><li><strong>In Story / Vs. Mode,</strong> your goal is to <strong>hit the flagpole and not crash</strong> afterwards for a couple of seconds.</li><li>You can only accelerate &amp; brake, <strong>you can not reverse</strong>!</li><li><strong>If you leave the screen</strong> to the right, your car will reenter it on the left. Make use of it!</li><li><strong>The stage with the bird</strong> is almost impossible. Try to annoy your friends with it lol</li><li><strong>Reset the game</strong> by pressing [F9] if you get stuck ortry to go back to the menu with [ESC]</li><li><strong>Don\u00b4t try to load a safefile when there is none</strong></li><li><strong>You can play the game with a gamepad</strong>. Space = Start (Button 10) in that case, Accelerate with Button [1]. You\u00b4ll figure it out.</li><li>[M] turns the music on / off</li><li><strong>In Battle Mode</strong>, press Accelerate + Brakes at the same time to use an item</li></ul>Cheat code for unlocking cars (glitchy)<ol><li>Press the [9] key on the keyboard unlocks the bus and lamborarri (though some graphics are missing / glitched)</li><li>Activate the info in Story / VS mode with [i] and then press [c], you can switch cars if you unlocked them.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a2/4a2a753b16eaca5d5f7fe47a4eae00ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["U-GameZ"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
