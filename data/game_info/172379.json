The result is a fun mix of fishing, treasure hunting, and the occasional run-in with Eldritch Horrors! Have fun fishing, leveling up, and finding treasure! Just make sure to avoid any eldritch horrors, old gods, or giant tentacles in any form.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a72fd870c6357c791f9c1fd43b5e19f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evan L"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
