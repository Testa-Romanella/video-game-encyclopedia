By playing the game, the player shapes and performs a uniquely generated musical score for a virtual audience.<br/></p><p><em>AOTS</em> uses a corpus-based, machine-learning system to generate music which attempts to emulate music from video games of the 1980s and 1990s. The system generates music in real-time to accompany the player's actions. The player mixes this generated music to match the whims and wants of the audience. As the player mixes to their audience, the audience becomes more excited and grows. </p><p>The music is played by a custom-build PureData patch designed after the original NES Rioch 2A03 chip with the Konami VRC6 expansion chip.</p><p><em>AOTS</em> was created as part of Cale Plut's MFA Thesis, at Simon Fraser University.<br/></p><p>AOTS is currently in development, with a full release planned for mid-late May, 2017.</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The Mac version can be placed anywhere EXCEPT the downloads folder. If placed in the downloads folder, the game will be unable to access some important binary files.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1b/e1b82c0c1949cec29a4b8b65bd23f608.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["OptimalGoat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
