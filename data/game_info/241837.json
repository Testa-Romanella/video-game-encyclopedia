Take that yawn back. Stagehand might look like your typical run-and-jumper, but it plays nothing like one. In Stagehand, you don't control the character, you control\u2026 THE STAGE.<br/><br/>Your job is to quickly and strategically position all the platforms on the level before our hero Frank (last seen in The Incident) runs headfirst into a cliff, or feet-first into lava. Stagehand is fast, hilarious, and fun. You're going to have a fantastic time with it.<br/><br/>What's in the box:<br/><br/>\u2022 Next-gen pixel graphics.<br/>\u2022 4 unique characters.<br/>\u2022 Another earworm of a soundtrack.<br/>\u2022 Haptic feedback for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.<br/>\u2022 Instant respawn for endless score-chasing.<br/>\u2022 Share an animated GIF of Frank's final moments!<br/>\u2022 The offical Stagehand-iMessage-Sticker-Pack is included with every copy.<br/><br/>Stagehand is everyone's favorite new flavor of the summer.
