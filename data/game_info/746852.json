I was originally planning on working with a team until the theme was announced, and I had the idea to mix pixelated and none pixelated objects. I had learned how to do this awhile ago with the tutorial here. My inspiration for a lot of the game was pretty directly inspired by games like <em>The Stanley Parable</em> and <em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em>. The sound and music was also done by me, mostly in Ableton and MaxMSP. I never thought that after a year of game development I'd be able to finish something for a game jam, so thank you so much for anyone who takes the time to play it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:00:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/940f16ccddccdea693a4908fa19203c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sam Knight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
