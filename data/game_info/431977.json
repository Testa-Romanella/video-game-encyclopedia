Rather, more.</p>\n<p>Then one day, I was reminiscing about\u00a0playing the Xylophone in high-school (since I sucked at Soccer, Basketball and Table Tennis) and I wondered if it were possible to create one in VR.</p>\n<p>So I did some sketches, modeling, and Unity. Here's a really rough Proof of concept.</p>\n<p>Things:</p>\n<ul><li>Demo was a 2-day build. Started Friday and finished Saturday afternoon, with me regretting the entire plan on\u00a0Friday night and Bible study on Saturday morning.</li><li>The Unity tutorials I was following broke with the latest Oculus Integration for Unity. Getting the hands to work was trouble.</li><li>The Xylophone I made is of a pentatonic scale. With two octaves. I'm in the key of F(-Major) IIRC.</li><li>I'm still building and I'd love love love feedback and criticism :) (please be kind, if you can)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T11:18:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/548121493f974932aa50ccc0e5756eeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Migisha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
