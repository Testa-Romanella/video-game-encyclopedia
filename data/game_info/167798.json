They are sended in a language that can be understood by ouer computers... What that could mean?<br/>- CIA's people have noted that the same sequence starts each time at the beginning of a new message.<br/>- They also found that, if you restart the program, the message will start from its begenning.<br/>- We have decoded a part of the message \"ttr\" and \"irc\", what could that mean? Is it a way to communicate with them?!</p><p>It's your mission to understand everything. This could be a plan to destroy the humanity! We need to stop them.</p><p>Be careful commander, we know that all of this is very linked to the internet.
