{"id": 974745, "slug": "psychic-world", "name": "Psychic World", "name_original": "Psychic World", "description": "<p>Psychic World is a platform game wherein the player&#39;s character Luc\u00eda runs from one stage to the other using her &quot;ESP Booster&quot; to blast monstrous enemies while obtaining item power-ups through them or by jumping on various ledges and platforms. The Booster has a gauge of how often certain items and abilities can be used, but that, as with her health, can be replenished by power-ups. All her weapons are upgradeable by merely picking up the same item for that particular weapon and new weapons are obtained through mini-bosses and end-level bosses. The player has to use Lucia&#39;s psionic weapons strategically in levels using different elements to their advantage (in the ice stage, rocks being doused by falling water can be frozen and used as a stable platform for Luc\u00eda to jump on by blasting the rock with the ice shot, while the sonic wave weapon can destroy certain foreground objects blocking her path).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T04:29:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a94/a94311aca8f51aaaf00643b819e09d8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Game Gear", "SEGA Master System"], "developers": ["Sanritsu Denki"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
