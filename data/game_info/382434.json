While connecting - if you collide with the ship, or move too far away from the specified radius, the connection will break and the connecting ship will be destroyed.<br/>- Avoid asteroids (or shoot them down). Note that if your mothership dies, the whole armada falls apart.<br/>- Every planet serves as a checkpoint. You need an armada with at least X amount of ships to invade a planet when you reach that checkpoint (X is shown in HUD).<br/>- You gain score for distance travelled + having more ships in your fleet than X.</p>\n<p>Made by Diptoman Mukherjee (Programming, design), Pranjal Bisht (Art, design) and Joel Montpetit (Audio) for LD45.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T10:06:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08e/08e448101226d3a8d6c4fc48bdfa66ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Diptoman"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
