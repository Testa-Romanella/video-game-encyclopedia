What Can You Do?<br/><br/>Welcome to the crazy world of the neighbor hide n seek. You are stuck with an angry neighbor in a maze from which he won\u2019t let you escape. Hello Angry Neighbor offers you a versatile gameplay experience you never had before. You have the option to play as a NEIGHBOR or as a RUNNER.<br/><br/><br/>RUNNER GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>If you choose to play as a Runner, you have to paint all the floor tiles. When you walk on a Green tile it is painted as Red. You have to paint all the floor tiles to Unlock the Exit Doors. But it not easy the neighbor is trying to catch you &amp; your AI mates. If he catches you it will be the end of your chance to escape so do not let him near you. If he\u2019s getting closer go to a SAFE POINT.  The neighbor can\u2019t enter the safe zone while you standing on it. So he\u2019ll probably move away to catch others. That gives you a chance to paint the remaining floors. But be careful only one runner can use a single safe zone so whoever gets first can use it. The other one has to go somewhere else. When all the tiles are colored GO THROUGH THE DOORS to win the game.<br/><br/><br/>NEIGHBOR GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>Don\u2019t like to run? You can play as a neighbor to catch them. CATCH ALL RUNNERS  before they paint all the floor tiles. If anyone of them escape the door you have lost your chance. Trick them from going away from safe zones &amp; then catch them off guard. You win when all the runners are caught.<br/>DESIGN YOUR GAME (CUSTOM GAME)<br/>You can design your own gameplay i.e. select the NUMBER OF RUNNERS , ENVIRONMENT SIZE,  DIFFICULTY etc. We  have given you all the control you need to test your skills.<br/><br/><br/>GAME FEATURES:<br/><br/>\u2022\tPaint The Floor<br/>\u2022\tTwo Game Modes<br/>\u2022\tArcade Mode with Level Progression where you randomly play as a neighbor or a runner<br/>\u2022\tDesign Your Own Game<br/>\u2022\tMultiple Player Roles (Neighbor &amp; Runner)<br/>\u2022\tHoles to Increase Difficulty<br/>\u2022\tEasy Swipe Controls<br/>\u2022\tMultiple Characters<br/>\u2022\tInfinite Levels<br/>\u2022\tUnique Map Generation<br/>\u2022\tFunny Sounds <br/>\u2022\tLeaderboard to Compete with Friends", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T05:46:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b98ce19a3c330ad44d8574b422163aaa_WvfLSmy.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ghulam Mustafa"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ghulam Mustafa"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
