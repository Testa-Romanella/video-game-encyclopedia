He can't remember something he looked at three seconds ago, but when you ask him to remember it, he does rather convincingly.\n\nThe games reveal a great deal of things to us, but for the average reader, all of it becomes unimportant when we know that the protagonist is able to remember things that others can't.\n\nAnd that's how our understanding of memory works.
