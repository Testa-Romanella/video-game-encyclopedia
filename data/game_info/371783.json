This game is a project I challenged myself to. The challenge is to program a HTML5 game that is like Factorio or Minecraft(basically where I get inspirations from) using pure Javascript without any frameworks or game engines. The game has many imperfections and bugs. The game art is not really nice as I had to create them myself (By the way, the water is just there for procedural generation). It was a great learning experience \u00a0and I do recommend others to do so too\u00a0because you have to create your own logic and algorithms.\u00a0Feel free to feedback in the comments! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T11:17:37", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzI0NDMwNTEucG5n/original/CP%2B1ak.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mnjq2006"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
