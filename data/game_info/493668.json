Hunt down whoever is responsible.<br/><br/>Humans came to your planet and took everything, including you. You must take out every person you can as you make your way towards the head of the invading company. Fight through the levels of this capitalist hell shown by the theme of each ship. From scientists who took breeding too far to mercenaries who kill their own just to move up, you will have to take everything down.<br/><br/>Humans are too tough to take head on. You will need to sneak around them and take them out one at a time. Stay out of their sight by tracking their scent and climbing the walls and ceilings. Crawling around will let you slip into tight spaces and use the architecture of the ship to your advantage, but you cannot attack while prowling this way.<br/><br/><br/>Pick up and hide the bodies. Use their own ship against them by slamming doors on them and turning out the lights with their terminals. Throw cans in order to distract them or lure them into a trap.<br/><br/><br/>Don't set off the alarms. People will run from you, alert others to you, set traps, and hunt you down. You must try to pick them off without alerting the others.<br/><br/><br/>Kill them all through 8 different ships in a short 1 to 2 hour story.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Crawl along walls and ceilings<br/></li><li>Kill from above and behind<br/></li><li>Use Terminals to turn off lights or lock doors<br/></li><li>Throw cans to distract or stun humans<br/></li><li>Dodge bullets and avoid traps<br/></li><li>NPCs react to your presence and bodies you leave behind<br/></li><li>Scoring at the end of each level<br/></li><li>Nine levels with different soundtracks</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T01:45:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec928149b11ab30639d1abcd3fe7fcf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam Clift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Liam Clift"], "esrb_rating": null}
