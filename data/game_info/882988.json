The Forest Folk grew them with care in 40 different fields, and now they\u2019ve asked Bear to harvest them. Problem is: the field is full of rocks and moles, making it a challenge to get the pumpkins to the sorting holes!<br/><br/>Firstly, this is south of the globe and we have grown pumpkins here during spring, ok? Now, with that out of the way, let's whack these annoying moles out of the way.<br/><br/>Carefully roll the pumpkins around. You can only push gently so as not to damage it! How will you do it to reach the hole?<br/><br/>Sometimes pumpkins can take a shortcut. Plan the way to do it!<br/><br/>There's much to harvest, but once the job is done, Bear can go hang out with his buddy Worm and enjoy a nice cup of pumpkin spice latte.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T04:39:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b765433f72f05ebe843058b54c1fccb6.jpg", "website": "https://badkid.games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bad Kid Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bad Kid Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
