It is designed to be played with <strong>4 controllers on a horizontal display</strong> so you can stand all around it, which is perfect for large gatherings like festivals or parties.<br/></p>\n<p>The setting of the game, is the <strong>Annual Pirate Championship</strong>. At this championship, you have your own ship, and the goal is of course to shoot down the other ships to stand victorious in the end.</p>\n<p>Since you start all alone on the ship, <strong>you need to run around</strong> to the mast to set sail, to the rudder to steer the ship, and most importantly to the cannon to shoot down your opponents.</p>\n<p>If your ship sinks there's no need to worry too much. You can <strong>swim and board the other ships</strong>, and still be part of the game. Whether or not you decide to help your new crew mates, however, is up to you.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Anne Clausen - @DjScoretrick<br/>Simon St\u00e5lhandske - @S_Stalhandske<br/>Amanda Rasmussen<br/>Steffen Mortensen<br/>Allan Asp Christensen<br/>Lena Mech</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER: XBOX CONTROLLERS REQUIRED &lt;&lt;&lt;</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d42/d422937ce805d8497e70565a2282a87b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Simon St\u00e5lhandske", "DjScoretrick"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
