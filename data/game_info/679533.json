For example, when a person is seen with groceries, in the thought, it will be that the person went shopping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea for this game is inspired by an event that happened and different stories arose when I asked a question, what was seen and what they think when they see a certain image.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>A detective trying to piece stories or scenery together to solve a case also inspired this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to place each individual in the scenery that suits them the most.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The waiting screen depicts the waiting timer, the task and the input for the game while displaying the models for the activity. The win-screen or lose-screen reflects a glimpse of the scenery while revealing a win or lose message.</p>\n<p>1: Seconds now start at 12 instead of 11.<br/>2. Mouse input for restarting the game.<br/>3. A rotating portal for the models while the countdown timer commences.</p>\n<p>4. The player has two options to arrange the models- (a) Click and drag a model at a time. (b) Click on each model so that they queue and then drag the models over the scenery, if a model comes in contact with its ordained box, the model snaps to the box and leaves the queue. (Option B is for the player to find out himself or herself).</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T08:10:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a6d0c6c493f0e3bc7d03c930978c9de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CraftersTV"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
