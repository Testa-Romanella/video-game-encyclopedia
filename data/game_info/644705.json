{"id": 644705, "slug": "rush-command", "name": "Rush & Command", "name_original": "Rush & Command", "description": "Rush &amp; Command is a classic voxel style multiplayer real time strategy game, that will intrigue both highly tactical as well as make-everything-up-as-you-go RTS players. The game is set in an alternate world where units and armies dating back from the 1960-1980 are enriched with high-tech current technologies and knowledge.<br/><br/>Inspired by childhood games that defined the RTS genre, Rush &amp; Command is here to combine that real nostalgic tactical RTS feeling with unique and innovative mechanics and ways to conquer your enemies on the battlefield. Whether this will be your first RTS game or you have been a RTS veteran since Utopia, you can plan out every move to outsmart real life or AI opponents, or make it your goal to obliterate every last player using your super weapons. It is all up to you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Conquer the battlefield by growing your base and your army. Gather resources to build a radar tower, barracks, high-tech laboratories or your own airfield. Keep an eye on your power supply and make sure your enemy does not get to target your powerplant, as it will be very difficult to train your army in the dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Create an army out of a variety of ground units, tanks, planes and more. You can choose whether you want to aim for quantity or quality, as you can promote and even upgrade your units using 3D-printers based on your needs in battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Play against other players in LAN and online PvP matches, or test your skills in local matches against well-trained AI teams. Dominate your enemies using super weapons, such as nuclear missiles or air strikes, but keep an eye on your radar, as your enemies will surely have the same goal in mind.<h3>Features:</h3>Don\u2019t let the bright colored voxel style fool you, this game is packed with all kinds of exciting features.
