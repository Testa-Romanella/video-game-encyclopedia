It was created as a tribute to classic sci-fi horror movies. Main goal was to create a great horror experience that will write a unique cinematic story with every game. Such a story that you will want to discuss with your friends for some time after the game!<br/><br/>Now, Nemesis Lockdown is going digital! This is a board game recreated in the digital world and since the game is very special to us we wanted the experience to be stellar. This game is targeted at both: Fans of Nemesis, who now will be able to play with their friends online, and new players who may not be too familiar with board games but still want a great sci-fi adventure!<h3>FEATURES:</h3><strong>- Well tested gameplay -</strong><br/>Nemesis Board Game was in a very long development, literally thousands of blind test plays until we got a formula that works. Now \u2013 after hundreds of thousands of players around the world played and enjoyed the game \u2013 core gameplay of Nemesis Lockdown is very well tested and proven to provide not only great fun (especially when you die), but also breathtaking cinematic moments.<br/><br/> <br/><strong>- Cinematic, turn-based horror sci-fi experience -</strong><br/>In Nemesis you do not hunt aliens, this is not a shooter. Weapons are mostly used for defense. Instead, you try to do everything you can to complete your objective and run from the base as far as you can. The presence of other life forms can make this a bit tough. <br/><br/><br/><strong>- Secret goals and hidden traitors -</strong><br/>One of the key mechanics in Nemesis is hidden objectives. Trust no-one, as some of the players you play with might want to kill you or have drastically different ideas about what to do with the current situation. But you NEED to cooperate to survive, so there is a fine line you need to keep with every decision.<br/><br/><br/><strong>- Beautiful fully 3D environment -</strong><br/>We have invested a lot into making sure the game will look right in this new medium. You can expect great graphics, animations, and models to help immerse yourself in the world of Nemesis.<br/><br/><br/><strong>- Solo and multiplayer modes -</strong><br/>You can play the game by yourself or enjoy it with your friends. Thanks to high replayability you will be able to play the game for dozens of hours and every game will be different.<br/> <br/><br/><strong>- Refined UX and calculations -</strong><br/>We have added a lot of extra work to create a seamless User Experience flow, that would decrease down-time and make all the calculations in the background while showing players all the important information as clearly as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T03:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/442/4428f34e015f7e705373f66cf27bf9f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 17, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 38, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 480, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Interstudio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awaken Realms"], "esrb_rating": null}
