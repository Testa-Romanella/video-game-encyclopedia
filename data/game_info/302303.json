Similar to ice hockey, players are tasked to shoot a frisbee at the goal zone of the opponent attempting to score.[1] In the game, players are able to select different stages and characters. Some characters from the original game, including Wessel, returns for the sequel.[2] Each character has their own attributes. For instance, some characters have more steady control than others at the cost of speed.[3] There are EX Moves, which are special powers can be activated for gameplay advantages.[4] Both single-player and local multiplayer modes are featured.[1]</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-30T18:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/445/4454ca9ba9b2e251ab2fa63354558b8a.jpg", "website": "http://www.dotemu.com/game/windjammers-2/", "rating": 4.08, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 291, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 23, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 98, "ratings_count": 40, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 40, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5", "PC"], "developers": ["DotEmu"], "genres": ["Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DotEmu"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
