To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. But you can find out by playing the game!<h3>Who is Rectangle Guy?</h3><br/>Rectangle Guy is the protagonist of Rectangle Guy. He's got pristine fashion sense, a \"unique\" sense of humor and he's an all around great guy. You'll get pretty familiar with him over the course of the game and may even learn of unexpected stuff about the guy, if you know where to look.<h3>Totally Epic Features</h3><strong>The Down Dash - </strong><br/><br/>Got a massive mouth demon chasing you? Need to impress a girl? Maybe someone is holding a gun to your head and telling you that you need to increase your falling speed? Well no matter which of those situations you find yourself in, Rectangle Guy's signature down dash ability will be able to help you out.<br/><br/><strong>Challenging Bosses - </strong><br/><br/>In addition to regular platforming levels, Rectangle Guy also features some challenging boss fights. During these, we use our innovative Fire Panel\u2122 technology to take down foes. And don't worry, there's no stupid random elements during these. By the end of these boss fights, you'll be running circles around the suckers.<br/><br/><strong>Time Attack Mode - </strong><br/><br/>The regular levels don't seem to be hard enough for you? Well don't worry, because Time Attack mode will give you a run for your money. Given a very strict timer, you will have to speed your way through levels. Clearing a Time Attack level is already hard enough, but the truly insane players will go for the elusive R ranking. <br/><br/><strong>A Whole Bunch of Environments - </strong><br/><br/>During the course of this game, Rectangle Guy will find himself in a lot of different areas. From the relaxing Grassy Plains to the gorgeous Profit City, there's always more to see. And, I mean, I don't wanna spoil anything but lemme tell ya some of the later worlds get WACKY.<br/><br/><strong>A Plethora of Post Game Modes - </strong><br/><br/>The main adventure is great of course, but if you become a true Rectangle Guy enthusiast, you may want more. Well don't worry, as there is a BUNCH of stuff to do after the main adventure. And when I say a bunch, I MEAN a bunch. There are hours of additional levels and challenges after the credits roll (some of which may be too difficult for their own good).<h3>You sold yet?</h3>If not, look at this lil doggy.
