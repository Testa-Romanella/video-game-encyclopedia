Enjoy the zen sounds of the water and zen environment as you have fun posing the fitness couple. In the initial levels, you'll have to exercise your posing abilities by only putting one of the yogis into the yoga poses. Once you've proved you're a master of posing one yogi, you'll move onto the challenging but fun task of posing a yoga couple! As you progress, the poses get more difficult and some gym equipment will be introduced to spice things up. Finding the balance is the key to solving the yoga poses!<br/>Namaste, have fun, and enjoy this zen experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T04:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/6724a2c984537a954ce1db5826800bbb.jpg", "website": "https://www.voodoo.io/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Voodoo"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Voodoo"], "esrb_rating": null}
