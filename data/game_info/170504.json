The game is set in a fantasy world and follows the protagonist \u201cKorvex\u201d, a mighty Battle-Mage, who must rid the kingdom of monsters and beasts attacking from within the realm. Unlike normal side scroller games where the goal may be to beat the level quickly or put a focus into intense perfect movement control by the player, in \u201cDefend The Kingdom\u201d the player\u2019s goal is to defeat every enemy present. As this is the goal of the player, the game will be designed to put a focus into thinking outside of the box on how to defeat all enemies present.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>Facebook:\u00a0</em>https://www.facebook.com/DefendTheKingdomVGG/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e31090f1643e106486dec173274e8911.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ViciousGeckoGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
