Can only be placed on ores, but give you a steady supply of the ore you place it on. (costs 100 gold and 5 emerald)<br/></p>\n<p>Debug stuff left in the game<br/>right clicking spawns a low level enemy<br/>O and P give you free stuff</p>\n<p>The bug is an actual bug I encountered while making the game where enemies would delete everything the stood on due to me trying to store everything on the same grid.</p>\n<p>This game isn't finished and never will be. I accidentally kicked the power cord for my computer loose and lost about 80% of the game's UI and II didn't think recreating it all from scratch would be worth it so I just kinda gave up. The gameplay is mostly finished, though so it's fully playable. There's just no real UI and the building controls were meant to be placeholders.</p>\n<p>Music made with Jukedeck</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b92/b92c6c4e4c700226d49fd9aaed80ac78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["puarsliburf games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
