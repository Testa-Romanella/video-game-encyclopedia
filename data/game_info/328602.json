I really like the design of the character, and we had\u00a0 some cool ideas for enemies and mechanics, the main reason for not getting back to it is that I got\u00a0 tired\u00a0 of mobile games and free-to-play mechanics. But we do intend to come back to it at some point!<br/></p>\n<p>For more info, check our Blog, or follow me on twitter to keep in touch!</p><p>Some old sketches and character design below:<br/></p>\n\r\nEnemy Design\r\n\n\r\nCharacter Concept\r\n\r\nCharacter Frames\r\n\r\nInitial Concept", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T05:02:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e54aea5bf35696f7ccdb91d90057bb74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MiniChimera"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
