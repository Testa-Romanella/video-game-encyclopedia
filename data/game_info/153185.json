It's a puzzle game where you must lead all the blind baby bats out of the cave using the sound of your voice. When you call them, they will move towards you as best they can. Watch out, though, because there are nasty spiders that will eat the babies if they touch them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5da/5da1edff868a918e4eae2b9485144315.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Space Whale"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
