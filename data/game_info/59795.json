I mean, it is an indie game which wants to set a thought in your mind and in which you will be bound to go only ahead. Look forward. This game is a third person. Without 2018 graphics, indeed, but which wants to impress by words. Listen to me and discover the message behind the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"The change\" is more like a story. A story which needs to be understood.<br/>\r\nWhen you'll buy this game, don't expect a very long gameplay, as this is my first game.
