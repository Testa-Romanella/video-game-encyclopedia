I would like to gather feedback\u00a0on the flow of the game mechanics as they stand right now.</p>\n<p>Currently the game has the following features fully implemented for you to test:<br/></p><ul><li>Farming</li><li>Animal Care</li><li>Beekeeping</li><li>Foraging</li><li>Fishing</li><li>Mining</li><li>Cooking</li><li>Crafting</li><li>Decorating</li></ul>\n<p>As of today the game is being worked on by a solo developer and\u00a0it's not expected to have a full release anytime soon. I'm just\u00a0working on this in my spare time and I'm doing it for fun and from\u00a0a place of love for life and farming sim games.<br/></p><p>Please send any relevant feedback to my email\u00a0jomiancu@gmail.com or contact me on Twitter @jomiancu.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to play this prototype, and\u00a0have fun!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Z/Enter:</strong> Confirm<br/><strong>X/Esc: </strong>Cancel/Use Tools/Use Item<br/><strong>C: </strong>Put item away<br/><strong>S: </strong>Menu<br/><strong>D: </strong>Open inventory<br/><strong>Q: </strong>Tool bar (Switch left)<br/><strong>W: </strong>Tool bar (Switch right)<br/><strong>Arrow Keys: </strong>Movement<br/><strong>Shift: </strong>Toggle Dash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T04:21:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f8115d7f04ab2410200c7ef2fed148a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jos\u00e9 Andrade"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
