The Swarm is coming.<br/><br/>When it comes you can't run, you can't fight. All you can do is hide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Plan carefully, and take your time. The Swarm only moves when you do. But beware, it will destroy every door, window, and fence standing it its way to get to you. Topple furniture, flip tables, and drag boxes to survive in over 50 devious levels in this new turn based twist on the block pushing genre. <br/><br/><br/> <br/>A fully voiced narration will put you in the shoes of the last survivor, as story sequences guide you through a linear narrative showing you the devastation from the ground level. Attempt to survive, but be warned the Swarm isn't the only thing standing in your way.<h3> Featuring: </h3><br/><ul><li> Windowed Mode<br/></li><li> Volume sliders for Music, Voice, and Sound Effects<br/></li><li> Undo and Reset<br/></li><li> Full subtitles</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T03:12:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f7/9f7750a4a56ef8b95689f352172867ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ternary Designs"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Ternary Designs"], "esrb_rating": null}
