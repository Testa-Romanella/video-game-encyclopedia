{"id": 877304, "slug": "150-floors-demo", "name": "150 Floors Demo", "name_original": "150 Floors Demo", "description": "<p>150 Floors of Magic or 150 Floors for short, is a tile-based RPG containing roguelike elements. You play as a mage of your choice. Fire, Ice, Electric, and many more characters. Each mage has a dream or goal they want to meet. The only similarities they share are to reach the 150th floor and conquer it, granting them any wish they desire... Or so the saying goes. Beware, the floors made of tiles have a durability limit. If you attack a monster, you're also attacking the floor as well and it may break, sending the monster 1 floor down. The same logic applies to monsters as well. If you fall through, you go to the previous floor. Will you fare against the 150 Floor challenge?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T13:34:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6da/6daeab882d0d9e9133d2e81a16915215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BindlestickMedia"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
