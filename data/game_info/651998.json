This will aid my player movement, for instance, running and jumping under forces of friction and gravity. This will add my character animations come to life for a 2D game. I used these advanced concepts to make Knight Zombie a significant python project for me to show off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Knight Zombie is a dark, spooky game where the zombies have risen! I wanted to make Knight Zombie a classic style 2D platformer, where you play as a trusty knight that has to survive night after night of the malicious zombie attacks. You have to jump from platform to platform; use portals to teleport across the level and attack zombies with your trusty sword. However, the zombies can rise from the dead so it's best to finish them off for good by stomping on them once you kill them with your sword! It's better to collect valuable rubies to replenish your health and add more points to the score tab.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a python game, I am really happy and proud to create Knight Zombie because I have gained knowledge of Python and it was fun to develop.</p>\n<p>Controls: Left Arrow to move left, Right Arrow to move right, Up Arrow to throw projectiles and Space to jump\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:12:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/90536e5f4468e5246e7b7d551f0c511a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
