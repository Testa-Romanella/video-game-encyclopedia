The individual games were initially released separately in 1983. They featured some themes inspired by the books of J. R. R. Tolkien and so became known as the Middle-Earth Trilogy.</p>\n<p>In 1986 the three games were revised, expanded and rereleased together as a compilation. For legal reasons the references to Middle-earth were removed and the trilogy was retitled Jewels of Darkness. The games now featured simple static graphics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/168529c5452f8a13955b212f4e67aa08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Atari 8-bit", "Atari ST", "Classic Macintosh", "Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II"], "developers": ["Level 9 Computing", "Level 9"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Telecomsoft", "Rainbird Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
