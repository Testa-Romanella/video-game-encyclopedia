{"id": 430329, "slug": "cold-comfort", "name": "Cold Comfort", "name_original": "Cold Comfort", "description": "<strong>Cold Comfort</strong> is an asymmetrical 5v5 Tactical FPS.<br/><br/>Play as either a Survivor or a Gamma Prime- each side having completely unique game mechanics and vastly different goals. <br/><br/>Each <strong>Survivor</strong> has their own exclusive weapon sets, skills and gadgets. Their unified goal: the preservation of humanity from the throes of the Gamma Strain pandemic. They must rescue and evacuate civilians, ensuring that the infection does not spread. <br/><br/>As with any virus, it's main prerogative is to evolve and disseminate. The <strong>Gamma Primes</strong>, victims mutated by the Gamma Strain, are the perfect catalyst for this task. As a Gamma Prime, you start the game embodying an infected rat. Scurrying around, spreading terror and infection. The more corpses and civilians you infect, the greater your respawn pool becomes. Choose when you want to take the next evolutionary step, and become a zombie, and then fully evolve into a Gamma Prime; using these stages to your advantage. <br/><br/>In Cold Comfort, the one true commodity is human life. <br/><br/>Behind the curtains of this struggle for survival, a much bigger story is playing out \u2013 a story involving a huge pharmaceutical corporation with a vision and all the things that can go wrong, because humanity is simply not ready for immortality.<h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Barricades &amp; Traps: Survivors have a number of tools at their disposal to maim and injure. </li></ul><ul><li>Dynamic Day/Night Cycle: The later it gets, the more powerful the Gamma Primes and Zombies become.</li></ul><ul><li>Dynamic Destruction: Barricades are only as good as their surrounding environment. Players can take advantage of certain structural weaknesses. </li></ul><ul><li>Gamma Prime Spawn Pool: The Gamma Prime\u2019s spawn pool is dictated by the number of zombies left on the map. No more zombies means game over.</li></ul><ul><li>Play as the virus: A truly asymmetrical aspect - Gamma Primes always spawn as rats, can evolve to zombies and then eventually Gamma Primes, and when they die the cycle continues. </li></ul><h3>MODULAR AI SYSTEM</h3><br/>Enabling a modular AI system allows for added depth and immersion, ensuring a wide variety of Civilians and Zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>PLAY AS A RAT</h3><br/>Gamma Primes always spawn as rats. They can bite corpses and Civilians activating the dormant virus within.  Once bitten, they will transform into Zombies.  When the transformation from Corpse to Zombie is complete, they can be bitten again, and the player embodies the Zombie. Players can then strategically choose when to evolve Into a Gamma Prime. Once they die, they spawn again as a rat, and the cycle continues until there are no more viable hosts left, or all of the Survivors are infected. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>CUSTOMIZABLE WEAPONS</h3><br/>Each Survivor has unique character-specific weapons and gadgets. Players can customize their weapons, to adapt to their own individual play style. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T03:44:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/659/6599be9208f7783d5b6be4e841309241.jpg", "website": "http://www.coldcomfortgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 388, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamma Minus UG"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TBA"], "esrb_rating": null}
