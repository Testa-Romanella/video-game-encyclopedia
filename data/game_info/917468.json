I plan to produce separate gameplay trailers and playable demos in the future, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Please like, comment, follow, and share! We all know how much time, energy and devotion goes into making a game, so every bit of feedback, love,\u00a0and support is greatly appreciated! There's still a marathon ahead of me.
