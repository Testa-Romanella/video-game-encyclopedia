A never ending legion of enemies is marching against your tower and it is up to you and your vast knowledge of turrets and wizardry to command a legendary last stand.<br/><br/>Tower of Grimoiria is not your traditional tower defense. This game offers a more immersive experience than the genre typically does by allowing you to play in first person during the waves and fight the enemies yourself with magical spells. Between waves you will have the traditional experience of buying turrets and upgrading them.<br/><br/>The map is different every time you play the game and you get to modify and expand the path the enemies take as your run develops.  A wide variety of biomes and unique enemies, environments, and even bosses add to the strategy of choosing which way to expand your path as it splits into multiple branches.<br/><br/>Each run will provide you a different experience as you will encounter new enemies, unlock new spells and find different magical accessories.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T06:47:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63d9d3525e69b156f4092dd39d24afce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 408, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tree Tap Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tree Tap Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
