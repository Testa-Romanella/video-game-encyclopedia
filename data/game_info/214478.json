This was going to be a walking simulator in which the player experiences a series of comedic vignettes and after each one they're given 2 doors to choose from. Each door brings them to a new vignette.<br/></p>\n<p>After discovering I still had the files for this game on my computer I downloaded the version of Unity I developed it in and decided to make some builds to put on Itch for the sake of preservation. If we ever decide we want to finish making this game we would start over from scratch using a more recent version of Unity.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Move</li><li>Left shift (held): Run</li><li>E: Interact</li></ul>\n<p>Credit goes to Rahee Mehra for the 3D models in game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf9ea202864b782388c9293ec3ef2b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["zlsinger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
