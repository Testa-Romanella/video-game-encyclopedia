Since the\r\n    <strong>Global Basesol League</strong> was formed in 2876AD, they have worked with the best Basesol players around\r\n    the world to compete for an international audience during Basesol season. Combining humankind's love of stargazing\r\n    and competition, Basesol was one of the first Sports 2 to capture the hearts of those curious about the limitations\r\n    of Astral Projection - or lack thereof!</p>\r\nDefault Controls\r\n<p><em>Controls can be changed in the Options Menu.</em></p>\n<strong>Command</strong><br/>\n<strong>Player 1</strong><br/>\n<strong>Player 2</strong><br/>\n<strong>Gamepad</strong>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Movement<br/>\r\n            Arrow Keys<br/>\r\n            IJKL<br/>\r\n            D-Pad\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Confirm\r\n            z<br/>\r\n            o<br/>\r\n            A Button<br/>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cancel\r\n            x\r\n            p<br/>\r\n            B Button<br/>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Pause\r\n            Enter\r\n            [<br/>\r\n            Start Button\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n<p>\n<em>What these controls do will vary depending on where in the game you are.

The <em>stopping team</em> has a <em>pitcher</em> who throws the <em>sol</em>\r\n    to the <em>jumping team's</em> <em>becomer</em> (much like a baseballian \u201cbatter\u201d), who must hit the <em>sol</em> with their spirit hands. Doing so\r\n    will fuse the <em>becomer</em> with the <em>sol</em> and project them into the game field.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once the <em>sol</em> is in the field, the <em>becomer</em> must jump off the <em>sol</em> and run to a nearby <em>star</em>.\u00a0Brighter stars have stronger gravitational pulls that will pull the <em>sol</em> towards them. Successfully arriving at\r\n    a star will earn the <em>jumping team</em> a point. The <em>stopping team's</em> job is, as their name suggests, to stop the <em>becomer</em> from reaching\r\n    a star safely.\u00a0The <em>stopping team</em> has two types of player at their disposal: the <em>catchers</em> that\r\n    guard each star, and the <em>wanderers</em> that can move freely around the game field. A <em>becomer</em> can be\r\n    taken \u201cout\u201d in a few ways:\r\n<br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If any player on the <em>stopping team</em> catches the <em>sol</em> while the <em>becomer</em> is still\r\n        fused with it, the <em>becomer</em> will become out.</li>\n<li>If a <em>catcher</em> is holding the <em>sol</em> when the <em>becomer</em> arrives at their star, they will\r\n        become out.</li>\n<li>Any <em>catcher</em> or <em>wanderer</em> can perform a <em>slam</em>, which will launch several mini black\r\n        holes out a short distance. if the <em>becomer</em> is caught in any of these, they will be <em>slam\r\n            dunked</em> and become out. Additionally, the <em>pitcher</em>'s black holes will last much longer than\r\n        those of other players on the\u00a0<em>stopping team</em> and will home in on the <em>becomer</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the <em>jumping team</em> has had 3 players taken out, the teams will switch and repeat. After both teams\r\n    have jumped and stopped, the next inning will begin. The game will end after three innings.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth information and advanced strategies, check out the \r\n    Full Instruction Manual.\r\n</p>\r\nAdditional Credits\r\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cAwake!
