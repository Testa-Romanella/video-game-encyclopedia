It's scripting language being statically typed, gave me much more features about auto completion and other stuffs. The framework has many built-in classes which help a lot. I think about Vectors, Sound, SoundEffect, and all the tooling around. I found very interesting to not have to worry about file extension when working with assets, beacause MGCB take care of it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>All these features make monogame the goto framework, but there a cost to it.\r\n</p>\n<p>First having to install .Net and Visual Studio was very frustrating for me; due to my low internet speed, installing the development environment took very long. And having to open to IDE in order to compile the project is not tha agreable, mostly when you just need to apply a few changes.\r\n</p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is that monogame games are more heavier than games made with other frameworks like L\u00f6ve 2d. The size is not that huge, but if you care about making your game as light as possible, it may disturb you.\r\n</p>\n<p>Finally, I find it a bit more complex to get into monogame than to get into L\u00f6ve 2d. You have many new concepts to learn, a different way of doing things. So for fast prototyping, L\u00f6ve 2d is a better choice.\r\n</p>\n<p>So, what to think about all of that ?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Monogame is great, very great for proffesional projects or relatively huge ones. We have a very powerfull IDE, publishing to other platforms is way easier, having a better autocompletion and a linting functionnalities make the coding eperience so much enjoyable.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I think for my part, I may prototype with L\u00f6ve 2d, and build the final project with monogame.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T13:45:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/467/467822c563cb88bb34bb510806433965.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sesso Kosga"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
