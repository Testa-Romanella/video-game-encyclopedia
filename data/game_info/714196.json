(Blood, mental illness, drug use, self-harm, etc). <strong>While I don't think this game deserves an 18+ rating as of right now I would probably say it is for 16+</strong></p>\n<p>The story, writing, concept, and world/character designs and voices are by me.</p>\n<p>Backgrounds by the lovely Lee Doyle (thank you so much man you're amazing)</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/leedoyleart?t=17ke2_RJnVrAv73r...</p>\n<p>Sprites and scenes by Bubblyernie! (You are a lifesaver, my friend, I'm very happy to have you on the team)\u00a0https://instagram.com/bubblyernie?utm_medium=copy...</p>\n<p>Music used from library of Antti Luode (slightly altered)\u00a0\u00a0https://twitter.com/aluode</p>\n<p>Inspiration and other concepts by @Charrfie and @Nervigg on Instagram and Twitter (Thank you both so much!!! Especially you Charffie, for pushing me to do this since the beginning, you're a massive inspiration to me and many others!)</p>\n<p><em><strong>ALSO A BIG HEADS UP!</strong></em></p>\n<p>I do not have the funds to continue updating the VN on my own! So if you choose to support me on patreon\u00a0your funds will directly go to the production of future chapters. If we don't get enough funding per month I'll try my best to cover the difference but that will be really hard for me. So your support is the key to this VN being produced! Especially for the first update. I am drained of resources at the moment and definitely can't afford to fund chapter 2 on my own immediately, so yeah :')</p>\n<p>P.S.\u00a0I am also a full-time college student and have obligations outside of this passion project, so if life calls I must answer!</p>\n<p>P.P.S. Don't go rooting around in the files first unless you want spoilers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 0.11-----</strong></p>\n<p>Hey! This is a <strong>VERY\u00a0SMALL\u00a0</strong>update that just attempts to fix some flow issues in a few places. If you have already played you do not need to worry about downloading and replaying this version.</p>\n<p>Also added a few choices, though they don't do much aside from slight dialogue differences, I'm hoping that they might have the chance to mean more down the line if the project continues.</p>\n<p>PPPS\u00a0In the event this is the last update, I must say, thank you all for your support and for giving Fell a shot. It truly means the world to me that people were able to enjoy my work to any degree. Thank you for your time :)</p><p><em>*And an\u00a0EVEN TINIER update to add some patrons to the thanks page*</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:41:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aa75ad303eb398892614cd76a17fb58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FellVN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
