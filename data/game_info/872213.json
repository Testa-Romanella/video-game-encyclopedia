As I started it this October, I went for a Halloween themed escape game with very simple mechanics. It was a great learning experience and I hope to develop more small projects in the upcoming months!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T11:55:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f01/f01e126904a1d7f6aacfb27a78a1c6c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["giucalistro"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
