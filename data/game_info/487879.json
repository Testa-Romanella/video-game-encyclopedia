She has long since lost contact with family and friends, only seeing Oculum and her childhood friend, Carein, on occasion. She fills her days with housekeeping, cooking, and cleaning for Oculum, and of course, reading books in his study dreaming of a different life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One day she stumbles upon a magic mirror sent to Oculum for study, and after touching it, she is transported far from home.
