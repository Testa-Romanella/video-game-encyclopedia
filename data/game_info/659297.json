Use your shield to turn them away! Will you be able to handle the onslaught of cacti?<br/><br/>There are six levels in this game.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>W: move shield on top of the cactus</li><li>A: move shield to the left of the cactus</li><li>D: move shield to the right of the cactus</li><li>Mouse: use once you've become a larger cactus to move around your shield</li></ul>\r\nNOTE: If you wait until the last second to pull out your shield, other cacti might get stuck in it! Just move it around until they get unstuck...but be warned: they might get mad and keep coming for you (and make an ugly noise) even though you've tried to turn them away!\r\n<p><strong>Made with:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Phaser (game framework)</li><li>Piskel (art)</li><li>GIMP (art)</li><li>Beepbox.co (music)</li><li>Bfxr (sound effects)</li><li>Font Squirrel Webfont Generator (font packaging)</li></ul><p><strong>Font:<br/></strong></p><p>Press Start 2P by CodeMan38 (Open Font License)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note from author:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>During this game jam, I learned the importance of taking my time (even during time-sensitive situations). This was my first game jam, and at first I was kind of rushing. After\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a024\u00a0hours,\u00a0though,\u00a0I\u00a0ended up\u00a0scrapping\u00a0my\u00a0first\u00a0idea and\u00a0almost\u00a0entirely\u00a0redoing\u00a0my\u00a0game with\u00a0a new\u00a0idea.\u00a0If\u00a0I hadn't\u00a0rushed,\u00a0then\u00a0this\u00a0may\u00a0not\u00a0have\u00a0happened. Overall, I had a lot of fun during this game jam and I'm happy to be a part of it (even though my game isn't that good :P).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b8/9b862f298881935b725b0c3b27f8a037.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["InterstellarBunny"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
