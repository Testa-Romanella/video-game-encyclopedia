The theme was \"other world,\"\u00a0and we decided to try to make a 3D platformer, where you can phase shift between worlds to make progress and reach the end of the level. We managed to get 2 solid levels designed and built, with the third level started but in rough shape. I went back and redesigned the first 2 levels\u00a0after the jam was finished.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Vladislav Volodin - Coding</p>\n<p>Jolanne Manalese - Level Design</p>\n<p>Jenny Sherwood - 3d &amp; Tech Art</p>\n<p>Marko Kuper (Me) - Coding &amp; Level Design</p>\n<p>Matthew McInerney - Audio</p>\n<p>Nathaniel Hachey - UI Design and Implementation, Level Design</p>\n<p>Jacob Giannone - UI Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T06:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6a/b6ab5fc062ad3c27a528ea4b008c2c50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MKuper"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
