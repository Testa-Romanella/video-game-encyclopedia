Then it occured to me that all levels would be look-a-like = boring, so I changed conception and gave myself artistic freedom! Of course, everything I've done is not what I wanted to look like - I wanted Futurama's rounded elevator tubes, hexagonal corridors etc. but if you try to imagine how would this game look like if done properly, you might even enjoy playing it out of nostalgia.</p>\n<p>I didn't have time to make last two levels because I had some ambitious ideas in mind (and hopefully I'll make them at some point) but long story short - You escape the station and reunite with Amy :)</p>\n<p>This poor attempt to make a game is inspired by AvP games (duh!), Alien Breed old&amp;new series, and two (free) FPSC games made by my \"compatriot\" PoisonGames: \"Deadly Space Stories - A.I. Gone Bad\" and \"Shoot Your Nightmare - Space Isolation\" which prove that with interesting story even simple designed games can by pretty entertaining.</p>\n<p>'F' IS USE BUTTON!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d6053a8e3ee80a1d8e1ccc1c2a19c2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 492, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PoorDevelopment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
