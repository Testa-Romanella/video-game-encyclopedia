{"id": 16117, "slug": "the-howler", "name": "The Howler", "name_original": "The Howler", "description": "<p>The Howler is an indie puzzle platformer game developed by Antanas Marcelionis. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot of the game is based on the Lithuanian novel Hour of the Wolf. It is set in an alternate version of the 20th century Lithuania. The Alliance of Free Cities was created by the Rothschilds. Alchemists perform their research, and inventors fly their steampunk airships, mechanics create robotics. The story follows a former United States Marine Antanas Sidabras, who lives in the Free City Of Vilnius and investigates a murder. A major conspiracy comes up during his investigation.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Antanas Marcelionis was the illustrator of Hour of the Wolf. The game inherits the same steampunk-induced visual style. The objective of the game is to fly your air balloon over multiple obstacles that will destroy it upon making contact. There are two ways of blowing the balloon. The players are able to either use their left mouse button to inflate the balloon or yell into the microphone if they have one (this is the default control scheme in the game). </p>\n<p>The players can also control the wind flow with the arrow keys. The game&#39;s world is highly interactive, so it is possible to get more speed and elevation using chimneys and steam pipes. The game heavily relies on physics and wind simulation, as the players have to avoid sharp obstacles, mines, and all other sorts of hazards.</p>\n<p>Trailers:<br />\nhttps://youtu.be/jolcjHcUDMM<br />\nhttps://youtu.be/-29qlNLapgU</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T08:25:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/271/271458a145626b16058f3023308be3fb.jpg", "website": "http://www.howler.com/", "rating": 2.3, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 51, "owned": 1311, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 15}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 81, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 81, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Antanas Marcelionis", "Ren\u0117 Petrulien\u0117"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Antanas Marcelionis"], "esrb_rating": null}
