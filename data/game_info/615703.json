Sneak through three different levels and create distractions as you try to uncover the truth of Doctor Witman's experiments and the Steampunk-inspired world.</p>\n\n\n<p>Clouds of Blue Blood is a fairly challenging stealth game. In the role of Gregory, you sneak your way past guards in\u00a0three different levels. Guards have patrol patterns that can be avoided or interrupted.</p>\n<p>However, once the guards have discovered you, Gregory's journey is over.</p>\n\n<p>Utilize objects in the environment in order to distract guards and open up paths to new areas. Ring bells, throw cans or turn on and off steam valves to create visual and auditive distractions.</p>\n<p>Gregory returns home from a day out with his friends and discovers the house in disarray, and his parents kidnapped. With some guidance from a mysterious woman, Gregory makes his way to the seemingly abandoned Lower Leach factory. Now, the factory is the lair of \u00a0Doctor Charles Witman, a former doctor turned medical scientist and inventor. At a first glance, \u00a0Doctor Witman's motives appear purely evil to Gregory. Although, things may not be as morally black and white as they appear in Lower Leach.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The main story, consisting of an introduction and two possible endings, are portrayed via a visual novel-like narrative. On each of the three levels, there are also five hidden, collectible\u00a0clues that uncover the truth behind \u00a0Doctor Witman, the kidnapping of Gregory's parents and the very world they live in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T07:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/032/0327394fcd92f2429e6e2285d86eb940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LevUNknown", "Life Cycle Games", "FuNuFFu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
