Explore a procedurally generated maps to save local citizens in need and assure them that they're never alone.</p>\n<p>If you fail to save enough Beebles (citizens), you lose. Make your choices carefully and quickly!</p>\n<p>*While you can play this in a browser, it is not recommended! It is very laggy!*</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Click: Fire a foam spray from your on-hand extinguisher. (Only hurts fire elementals)</p>\n<p>Space: Dash in a direction you are moving. (Will hurt anything that can take damage, including the friendlies, so be cautious!)</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys: Move in a direction.</p><p>E and R: Use corresponding abilities (E unused, R energy drink)</p>\n\n<p>The gameplay is split into missions. Each mission will have a starting number of Beebles (citizens) in each level. Over time, they will be killed by fire elementals attacking them. To pass a level, you must kill every fire elemental in that level and in turn save the Beebles. After clearing out each level and making it to the end, you will be given an opportunity to spend currency you earned from saving Beebles at a shop. The upgrades you can choose from will benefit you in various ways.</p>\n<p>The more Beebles you save and the faster you save them, the better you be able to progress as you will earn more coins to spend in shops and longer you take the more difficult the game progresses.</p>\n\n<p>Some assets were found online free-to-use.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Alexandr Zhelanov for the music which we delightfully used and edited.</p>\n<p>Thank you also to ShatteredReality who made the wonderful Modern City Top-Down Tileset that we used.</p>\n<p>Thank you also to Clint Bellanger who made the Bitmap Font used for the HUD.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T11:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24c68b4558814e78d4f42ae2dc8638ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Proto_here", "MythicalEngineer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
