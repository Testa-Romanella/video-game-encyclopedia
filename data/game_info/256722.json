{"id": 256722, "slug": "our-new-home", "name": "Our New Home", "name_original": "Our New Home", "description": "<p>Made for Godot Wild Jam #2 (only tested on linux)<br/></p>\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Grow food and build shelter for for settlers escaping war. Build towers to reveal land <em>hidden within</em> the waves.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 The main goal is to make sure you have net positive food and shelter to sustain a growing population.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 All improvements can be built by a single unit, but farms require units working on them each turn (+2 food per unit) and houses require 8 of the wood resource and 6 of the earth resource to build and permanently provide +6 shelter. To harvest the \"earth\" resource you need to use the \"dig\" command on a unit (+1 earth per unit on the tile). \u00a0To get wood you need to use the \"work\" command on a \"forest\" tile (+1 wood per unit). Building a \"tower\" costs 16 wood and reveals new tiles that you can use to harvest more wood and earth, and build more farms and houses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Population cannot grow higher than shelter, so when new settlers arrive shelter must be built to accommodate them by the next turn or they will die. And if food reaches 0 then units will die each turn until food output is positive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Splitting units into smaller groups (i.e\u00a0 6 units on one tile -&gt; 3 units each on 2 tiles) is important for maximizing the amount of resources you can get each turn. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 WASD to pan camera. QE to rotate camera. Mouse Wheel to zoom. Right Click to move all units selected. To split units: click the unit you want to split then click an adjacent tile, a \"Move\" button will appear in the ui. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/166/16651ceb6faaf21f89af283c5c332221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ibex"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
