Just not enough time to day dream, that\u2019s the problem. And if you don\u2019t get time to day dream, then how are you ever going to come up with an idea for an amazing world changing computer game? Actually, maybe it\u2019s just as well - as this amazing computer game becomes sentient and starts to mess with the time space continuum.\u00a0<br/><br/>It\u2019s up to you to defeat it! And try not to get in trouble with the teachers.<br/>Full of charm and warmth, with graphics, animations and elements of the programming done by the students, we hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>Made by</strong><br/>Milo Ferris<br/>Dylan McCauley<br/>Matthew Taylor<br/>Abbey Rob<br/>Reece McCombe<br/>John Cooke<br/>Chad McKnight<br/>Bobby McGowan<br/>Cameron Allen<br/><br/>With thanks to Enterprise NW and Atlantic Social Lab</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T12:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da4/da469c9c7fb443493964716fafd4c48d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kippiegames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
