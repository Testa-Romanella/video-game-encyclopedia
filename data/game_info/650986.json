{"id": 650986, "slug": "captures", "name": "Captures", "name_original": "Captures", "description": "Captures is a chess-driven puzzle game. The objective is to capture the opponent's pieces.<br/>While the chess pieces move according to the regular rules, the board itself varies from level to level. Boards from 3x3 to 8x8 are present in the game.<br/>Also certain squares on the board might have \"tile effects\".<br/><br/><br/> <br/>When you capture a piece on a cursed square, you lose your piece as well. <br/><br/><br/> <br/>Pieces that land on a poisoned square will expire in 3 turns.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Pieces placed on the portal move to the other portal after black completes its turn.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/>Pieces that land on a tile with the random effect will transmute into another piece.<br/><br/><br/>The levels are mostly beginner friendly. People who are looking for a challenge can attempt a built-in speedrun. In speedrun mod levels start one after another, and the player has to make fewer than 5 mistakes through out the whole run.<br/><br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/><br/>-Drag &amp; drop pieces. <br/>-Click the restart button or press R key to restart the levels.<br/><br/><strong>RULES</strong><br/><br/>-All black pieces must be removed from the board to win the level. <br/>-If a stalemate occurs, the level fails.<br/>-If white loses all of their pieces the level fails. However, if white loses their last piece at the same time with the black, the level is completed.<br/>-During a speed run, reseting a level counts as a mistake.<br/><br/><br/><strong>TIPS</strong><br/>-Random tips will be shown through out the game.<br/>-CPU likes to trade pieces, take advantage of it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T15:44:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3e/f3e47a6a4a5785d0ab3ca9fa791f8237.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cosmic_dust"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": ["cosmic_dust"], "esrb_rating": null}
