The theme was \"Delay the Inevitable\"</p>\n<p>Solve as many puzzles as you can before the bomb detonates! Each puzzle you solve extends the clock, but each puzzle you fail cuts your time even shorter.</p>\n<p>Inspired by Keep talking and Nobody Explodes. I wanted to have more puzzles in the game but I ended up having a late start and didn't quite have time for everything I wanted. I wanted to hone my 3d skills a bit so it was a good learning experience!</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>Assets:</p>\n<p>Tile Texture: Jacob https://opengameart.org/content/clean-repeatable-tile</p>\n<p>Metal Textures: Spiney https://opengameart.org/content/metalstone-textures</p>\n<p>Notebook: Rodolfo Rubens https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/school-supplies-96667</p>\n<p>Fire Particle Systems: Himmelfar https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/fire-explosions/particle-sys...</p>\n<p>Audio:</p>\n<p>Explosion: qubodup https://opengameart.org/content/3-background-crash-explosion-bang-sounds</p>\n<p>Kenney Game Assets</p>\n<p>Clock tick, Page Turn: Nicole Marie T <br/>- https://opengameart.org/content/slow-clock-ticking-seamless-looping-sfx-sound-ef...</p>\n<p>- https://opengameart.org/content/page-turning-sfx-sound-effect</p>\n<p>Alarm: yd https://opengameart.org/content/short-alarm</p>\n<p>Fonts:</p>\n<p>Game Over by Pedro M.
