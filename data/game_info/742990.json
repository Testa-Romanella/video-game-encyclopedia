In this game, you control a single helicopter, against an army of planes bent on knocking you out of the sky! Fighter planes will shoot back, however most of the enemies will simply attempt to ram you. Utilize 3 available weapon types to shoot them down:</p>\n<p>Laser - Fast, semi-piercing(projectile persists if enemy dies).</p>\n<p>Triple Cannon - Average speed, shoots 3 projectiles that spread out in front of you.</p>\n<p>Rocket Launcher - Slow, but high damage. Generates an explosion on hit that pierces enemies. <br/></p>\n<p>Offering this game for free, however any donations will be much appreciated as I continue developing more games!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:47:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/570/570a193e1d1a35080fcaba0abc848024.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CynthiasGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
