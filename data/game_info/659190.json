We're setting you free! All you have to do is walk out!</p>\n<p><em>But not so fast.</em></p>\n<p>It seems that I've \"lost\" the key to your ball and chain. And it's a long way to go to get out of this prison, I'll tell you. Have fun dragging it the\u00a0<strong>whole way with you.</strong></p>\n<p>And don't think just because you're free now we won't be keeping an eye on you.\u00a0<strong>One wrong move</strong> and you'll be right back in the cell where you came from.\u00a0<strong><em>Don't think about starting any trouble on your way out.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Ball and Chain is a 2D platformer where you drag along a spiked ball behind you. Navigate your way through the prison complex as you break through obstacles in your way, and avoid hurting any of the other prisoners with your wild swinging\u00a0<strong>ball and chain!</strong> Have fun!</em></p>\n\n<p>This is my first ever game jam entry, and my first time building a full game using Unity. I've learned a whole lot along the way, and I hope you all find the game as fun to play as I\u00a0did to make!
