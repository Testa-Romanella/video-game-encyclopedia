That means that the middle of the screen is forward, the middle-left and middle-right are directly to your left &amp; right, and the edges are actually right behind you. Play around a little and you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Move: WASD<br/>Look: Mouse<br/>Shoot: Left Click<br/></p>\n\n<p>Hint: Try to shoot both of the twins at once.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the jam build has a pretty severe lighting bug -- you can <strong>download a fixed version\u00a0</strong>here. Everything else is the same!
