Take on the role of an ape in a minecart and ride the rails as far as you can while dodging inbound minecarts and leaping over gaps in the track.<br/><br/>The game features a variety of game modes, each introducing new challenges and gameplay opportunities:<br/><br/><ul><li> Classic - standard, balanced gameplay<br/></li><li> Superflat - like classic, but all track segments generate at the same vertical height<br/></li><li> Low gravity - enables longer air time at the expense of jump accuracy<br/></li><li> Too much brake - near-limitless braking ability<br/></li><li> Ultra mega - enemy carts spawn more frequently and move faster<br/></li><li> Late start - start with more points and gain an initial speed-boost<br/></li><li> Crocodile craze - holes don't spawn, and enemies spawn more frequently<br/></li><li> No holes barred - enemies don't spawn, and holes spawn more frequently</li></ul><br/>All game modes can also be played with two players on the same system in split-screen multiplayer.<br/><br/>Minecart Madness supports keyboard and controller input modes for one or two players.<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Gamepad inputs use default SDL_Joystick mappings which means there is no standard scheme for controllers. If you are serious about using a controller, I would recommend using the steam controller mapping I created for the game, or your own custom scheme.<br/><br/>Player 1:<br/><ul><li> C - Confirm/Jump<br/></li><li> X - Back/Brake</li></ul><br/>Player 2:<br/><ul><li> . - Confirm/Jump<br/></li><li> , - Back/Brake</li></ul><br/>General:<br/><ul><li> ARROWS - Menu navigation<br/></li><li> F - FPS display toggle<br/></li><li> G - Fullscreen<br/></li><li> SPACE - Pause</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T03:54:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b20/b2032035656bdf3e3b1fb2efbffad1d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luke James"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Luke James"], "esrb_rating": null}
