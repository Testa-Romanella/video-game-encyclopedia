The players will play a student struggling to finish their essay during finals season at college. However, it turns out that each day, after catching up with their friends and getting their work done, no matter how much work they put into the essay (via the playable minigame), the day repeats itself after they go to bed! Now try and break the time loop as the student. Talk to your classmates about it, invest in the world around you, or try to seek help, maybe from someone outside the loop!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:58:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/825/825771a81e40be5722682d5bc3644718.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mysskx08"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
