How their silent prejudices ultimately leave the world in a pale shadow of what it could be.\u00a0 And how I just really want to punch some people in the f***ing face when they say something ignorant.<br/><br/>It's definitely not a deep game, but it helped me get out some frustrations.<br/><br/>I made this in 5 days before I needed to start on my Retro\u00a0Jam entry. It uses an assortment of free and purchased assets from the Unity Store. It's unpolished and rough around the edges but still pretty fun imo.<br/><br/>Browser works okay but probably runs better if you download it.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/><br/>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - Look</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Punch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T07:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b0/9b0ba945f993149ef4691569e41aefbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AesopB3EF"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
