{"id": 559804, "slug": "snailanx", "name": "Snailanx", "name_original": "Snailanx", "description": "<p>When the holiest relic of a race of bureaucratic snails is stolen, it is up to you to reclaim it. In such desperate times you must disregard your people's law that the stamp must approve everything\u00a0and embody the most dangerous\u00a0ancient Snail-ese fighting technique, the SNAILANX.  Use WASD or arrow keys to move.</p>\n<p>We struggled a bit in terms of getting consistent visuals and sounds, with the fact that a lot of the assets look fine but don't match being one of the big unsolved issues with the game. We leaned pretty heavily on using a single 'aztec' tile pack purely because it looked good and was extensive enough to get a good variety in the same style. Inserting narrative via dialogue was also difficult, though after eventually discovering that we could have some exposition delivered by inanimate game objects hijacking the dialogue system we have a decent amount. Mechanically the game is pretty loose, and intentionally so. The only real mechanic is fighting with the mime enemies and even that is a one hit kill system. I think that makes the end boss anticlimax is a little fun though.</p><p>\u00a0It was really fun to get the snail rotation system (where an appropriate sprite is picked based on the rotation of the player). Other stuff, like the dialog system and sounds were a bit annoying to implement in terms of details. Also, the way that scenes work was really annoying, with a lot of extra debugging time and effort due to the fact that the dialog system only works when you actually start from the MainMenu scene.<br/></p>\n<p>Attributions:</p>\n<ul><li>Spears : Created by Jordan Irwin (AntumDeluge)\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/spears</li><li>Snails : Slime snail by Tuomo Untinen\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/slime-snail</li><li>Aztec Tileset : Created by Sevarihk\u00a0https://sevarihk.itch.io/aztec-asset-pack</li><li>Mime : Created by Nelson Yiap\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/french-mime-with-beret-16x16-animated-spritesheet</li><li>Quaver Font : Made by Nathan Scott\u00a0https://caffinate.itch.io/quaver</li><li>Enemy hit sound : Made by Maskedsound\u00a0https://maskedsound.itch.io/8-bit-sfx-pack</li><li>Stamp : Made by us (that's why it looks so bad)</li><li>Tittle Screen by sawsquarenoise<ul><li>Link:\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/music/sawsquarenoise/dojokratos/tittle-screen</li><li>License:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li></ul></li><li>Some Amount of Evil by Kevin MacLeod<ul><li>Link:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4388-some-amount-of-evil</li><li>License:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</li></ul></li><li>Prelude and Action by Kevin MacLeod<ul><li>Link:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4236-prelude-and-action</li><li>License:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</li></ul></li><li>Boss Theme by sawsquarenoise<ul><li>Link\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/music/sawsquarenoise/dojokratos/boss-theme</li><li>License:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li></ul></li><li>Hope Is Not Lost by Jim Hall<ul><li>Link:\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/music/jim-hall/synth-kid-elsewhere/hope-is-not-lost</li><li>License:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li></ul></li><li>Also they weren't used\u00a0<em>in</em>\u00a0the project in a visible way\u00a0but a software called Tiled and the unity plugin SuperTiled2Unity were fun to work with and made it possible to do some cool stuff with the tileset in the second zone.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:31:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aae15d428b52c12694d9f709eb6f3ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["allecher"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
