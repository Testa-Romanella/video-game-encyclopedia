As you know, experimental self-driving cars are introduced into our city. They comply with traffic signals perfectly, but they don't care about other cars until getting too close!<br/>\r\n        Your task is to bring order to this chaos, until engineers fix the AI error!\r\n    </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Halt!: VR Road Traffic Madness is a simulator of road traffic control officer.</p>\n<p>At this prototype version, you deal with endless waves of cars and ambulances. You can wait for a while to create a traffic jam for harder challenge, you can put all your effort to crash cars for fun. Play as you like!</p>\n<p>First, you need a decent PC with HTC Vive and 2 Vive Controllers.</p>\n<p>Second, download zip below, extract it.</p>\n<p>Third, stand up straight (actually possible to play in a swivel chair I suppose...), run VR Road Traffic Controller.exe</p>\n<p>In the game, you encounter two types of car:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Normal cars, they obey your signal.</li>\n<li>Ambulances, they won't stop because they're in a hurry!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All you need to do: <strong>pointing a controller horizontally to allow traffic, vertically to halt.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How to restart/quit?</strong></li>\r\n    I'm afraid I couldn't implement these commands comforming to VR experience. Remove HMD and close the game window.\r\n    <li><strong>Does it work with Oculus Rift+Touch?</strong></li>\r\n    I hope so, but since I don't have them I cannot guarantee. Let me know in the comment whether it works!\r\n    <li><strong>Okay you used many free assets, so which part did YOU\u00a0actually create?</strong></li>\r\n    Mainly I worked on setting up environment (i.e. NavMesh, colliders and triggers), writing codes to control cars (Auto cruise, proximity &amp; traffic light detection, path-following physics-based steering), and VR integration with SteamVR plugin (traffic light control using Vive controller).\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n<p>I'm planning to make several goal-oriented levels, gradually increasing difficulty such as low visibility, additional vehicles like big trucks, motorcades, and trolley.\r\n    Additionally I will polish UI and create easier level for tutorial. Please let me know if you have any ideas for improvement!\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\u00a0\r\n(ordered by asset category then publisher name)\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    I developed this prototype withoug spending a penny during the development (I purchased Mini Car Kit long before IGMC though.)<br/>\r\n    I wouldn't have made it without these great asset publishers, thank you!\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n        2D\r\n        <ul>\n<li>Borodar /\u00a0Farland Skies - Cloudy Crown</li>\n<li>Unruly Games /\u00a0Simple Vector Icons</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\r\n        3D\r\n        <ul>\n<li>Hit Jones /\u00a0SciFi Handlight Free [HQ, Lowpoly, PBR]</li>\n<li>Jacek Jankowski /\u00a0Simple Modular Street Kit</li>\n<li>karboosx /\u00a0Low poly European City Pack</li>\n<li>Kenney /\u00a0Nature Pack (Extended)\u00a0and\u00a0Mini Car Kit</li>\n<li>NightSoundGames /\u00a0Stylized Astronaut\u00a0(super cute)</li>\n<li>Polyperfect /\u00a0Low Poly Animated People</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\r\n        Audio\r\n        <ul>\n<li>Crypton Future Media /\u00a0Operation Sounds\u00a0Free\u00a0 (Cursor_002)</li>\n<li>Kristian Grundstr\u00f6m /\u00a0ENGINES\u00a0(Smashed_Window_03)</li>\n<li>Marcos Schultz /\u00a0MS Vehicle System (free version) (Idling)</li>\n<li>Too Tidy Labs /\u00a08-BIT Diversity Collection: FREE EDITION (14 Sounds) (cartoonPolice 16-bits)</li>\n<li>Unity Technologies /\u00a0Standard Assets (Skid)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\r\n        Tools\r\n        <ul>\n<li>DotTeam / Car Script basic</li>\n<li>Valve Corporation /\u00a0SteamVR Plugin</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\r\n        VFX\r\n        <ul>\n<li>Synty Studios /\u00a0Simple FX - Cartoon Particles</li>\n<li>Unity Technologies /\u00a0Unity Particle Pack 5.x</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/413/4137b79193b9b5609d73eb67f8e2c0e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Napier @ 0bsolete Lab."], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
