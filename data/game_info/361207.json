Sling yourself around planets to explore and escape the system!</p>\n<p>The game can take a minute to load, please be patient with it!</p>\n<p>Unified Force started from the idea of using a single button press and single main mechanic for the whole game. I decided on Gravity, then had a lot of fun using Gravity as a means of procedurally generating an asteroid field-esque map. Ended up having some difficulties with the player's controls, since I imposed the self-limitation of only using a single button, and a certainly think that could be improved. I had a significant amount of problems with the camera. My goal was for the camera to move and zoom automatically so show nearby gravity objects based on their mass and proximity, but system just didn't quite come together in time, resulting in some occassionally strange behavior. That's something I'll likely work on fixing before adding it to my own portfolio. Overall in the future, I think I need to bear in mind Unity's limitations; The map generation is cool, but it uses so many small objects that Unity is barely able to handle it all.\u00a0<br/><br/>Sound effects generated through BFXR.
