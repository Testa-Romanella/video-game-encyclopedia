Except if the ball smacks you on the back of the head too much, you die. And tanks can shoot at you. And the field has human-sized pinball machine parts.</p><p>Human competitors can\u00a0<em>strike</em>,\u00a0<em>throw</em>, and\u00a0<em>kick</em> balls - these moves have sort of a rock-paper-scissors system:</p><ul><li><em>Strike </em>is reliable but the hardest to aim, you can <em>Strike </em>a <em>Kicked </em>ball pretty easily</li><li><em>Throw </em>is accurate, but the timing can be unforgiving. <em>Throwing </em>launches the ball straight forwards from you, but is slower than a <em>Strike </em>or <em>Kick</em></li><li><em>Kick </em>gives the ball the most speed, and is a good counter to a <em>Throw</em>, but while you slide along the floor you don't have your normal range of movement - and you could end up getting hit by a fast rebound</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>[Z]</strong> Menu confirm/strike ball</li><li><strong>[X]</strong> Throw ball</li><li><strong>[Z + X] </strong>Slide kick</li><li><strong>[ESC]</strong> Pause</li><li><strong>[ARROW KEYS </strong>Menu scroll/move</li></ul><p>Gamepad:</p><ul><li><strong>[A]\u00a0</strong>Menu confirm/strike ball</li><li><strong>[B]</strong> Throw ball</li><li><strong>[A + B]</strong>\u00a0Slide kick</li><li><strong>[START]</strong> Pause</li><li><strong>[D-PAD] </strong>Menu scroll/move</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T05:23:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e13/e135ced8a71fda48251d2aa2558f1b75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hwilson"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
