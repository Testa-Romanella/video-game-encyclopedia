Successfully saving the kingdom, Amadeus seeks the fireball spells. Yet he is summoned to save the homeland with his friends - Zoya and Pontious. Goblins have taken over the land as they are trying to find the mysterious &quot;Witch&quot; deep in the forest. </p>\n<p>Although having more than one playable character, Trine successfully uses all three of them. Amadeus as the mage is able to move objects or create boxes and planks to help overcome some obstacles. Zoya is very agile so she can hook and grapple on some surfaces, or shoot different targets. Pontious is the strongest character in combat, and he can destroy walls in his path or deflect things with his shield. Having this three different characters, it is necessary to use all three of them to solve puzzles and beat the level. Not only you can play alone, but the game supports three players cooperative to make progress even more atmospheric. </p>\n<p>Beautiful design, music and a narrator makes Trine a great story, that feels inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien himself.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2013-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:33:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c97/c97b943741f5fbc936fe054d9d58851d.jpg", "website": "http://www.trine2.com/", "rating": 3.72, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 415, "owned": 5791, "beaten": 512, "toplay": 105, "dropped": 300, "playing": 16}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 301, "ratings_count": 882, "suggestions_count": 566, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 884, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Frozenbyte"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Frozenbyte"], "esrb_rating": null}
