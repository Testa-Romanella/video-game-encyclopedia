The concept is a game within a game. \"BU YAO\" is a game that the main character (player)\u00a0is trying to play in his/her own room, but then player\u00a0got pulled into the game accidentally. The goal is to find clues along the exploration of the haunted house and\u00a0get back to reality. We also feature 3 endings (one is still in development) to the gameplay. Player's choices along the way will influence the result.\u00a0</p>\r\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\r\nGameplay Highlights:\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>Reality vs. Game:</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Player starts off in his/her own room (reality), trying to play a computer game named \"BUYAO\". However, player falls into the world of the game and he/she needs to get out.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Lighting &amp; Candle:\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\n<p>We deliberately set the room to be dark at first. The only way for the players to see clearly what's surrounding is to light up the candles along the way. We employ this interaction to let players explore the area on their own and create an uncanny feeling.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Dialogue:\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Along the way, players will sometimes hear a disturbing voice talking, telling players what to expect (only hints, not directions) Players can interact with objects to trigger the dialogue.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Reflection &amp; Mirror:</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Mirror is the first scary moment players going to encounter. And the interaction is mandatory in order to proceed to next area and to get an important clue for the ending. We want to use the mirror reflection to create a shocking and scary moment.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fulu (cursed papers):\u00a0</strong><br/>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Fulu \u7b26\u5492 is the cursed paper that often used to seal ominous object/signs. The interaction with Fulu is another important part of the game because they are set to seal the key object to escape the world from player's reach. And player needs to figure out a method to get rid of the Fulus.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Bu Yao (hairpin):\u00a0</strong><br/>\n</li></ul>\n<p>As implied by the main title, Bu Yao \u6b65\u6447 is the key to this game. Bu Yao is a common hairpin used by ancient Chinese women. Especially for brides, they often wear a significant\u00a0amount of beautiful hairpins for decoration purposes. At the very end of the game, player needs to make a bold move to interact with the ghost bride and get the Bu Yao (hints are implied in mirror :)</p>\r\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\r\nBackground on Ghost Marriage (\u51a5\u5a5a):\r\n<p>Ghost Marriage is a marriage in which one or both parties are deceased. It is usually set up by the family of the deceased and performed for various reasons, including: the death of an engaged person before the wedding, to integrate an unmarried woman into a patrilineage. BU YAO referenced from this idea and the bride character is a victim of ghost marriage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These information can also be found during the gameplay.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\r\nDocumentation:\r\n<p><strong>GitHub\u00a0repository for complete project files</strong></p>\n<p>Development\u00a0&amp; Postmortem\u00a0log</p>\r\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\r\nExternal Credits:\r\n<p>link for\u00a0Credit List\u00a0of 3D models used in this game.</p>\n<p>Player movement referenced from OVR Toolkit.</p>\r\nAll Gameplay,\u00a0UX, Programming\u00a0are original.\r\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\r\nDirections for Oculus Quest Input:\r\n<p>Left thumbstick\u00a0for moving orientation / Right for facing angle\r\n</p>\n<p>Rear R hand trigger for picking up object</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T20:01:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/598/5983fc822e5cc95aa5deba3776482986.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["xcc_89", "aaangelaZ", "Junru Xu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
