By lowering obstacles, by NOT tripping bad items, by NOT directly running over the bean and Smooshing it,<br/>\r\nand ideally, by doing it in as little time as possible if you are competitive and want to brag a bit :-)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe target audience is early teens and older, due to the bean character being \"smooshed\",<br/>\r\nand humour content (very bad puns),<br/>\r\nThere is no elite skill barrier - anyone capable of using a Windows PC can play - albeit some better than others :-)", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38f/38fadefafcf96d1968054475699397c4.jpg", "website": "https://patreon.com/pcandvr", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PCAndVR"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["PCAndVR"], "esrb_rating": null}
