{"id": 418004, "slug": "infatuated-innsmouth", "name": "Infatuated Innsmouth", "name_original": "Infatuated Innsmouth", "description": "<p>Created for the Bad Lovecraft Game Jam 2020.</p>\n<p>Infatuated Innsmouth focuses on Curtis, a young man from the city of Innsmouth who has recently moved to Arkham, Massachusetts. As a resident of Innsmouth he has certain visual features which people may determine to be strange--namely, the notorious \"Innsmouth Look\" for which the town is known, presented here as just being a cute anime fish-boy because this character was originally created when the developer was in middle school. Help Curtis to explore the town and try to fit in as best as possible, and hopefully not fall victim to madness or murderous cult members.</p>\n<p>The developer is planning on uploading either an update to this or a kinda-sequel, as they got the idea to make a game entirely using text input instead of choices, but unfortunately ran out of time and had to go back to the multiple choice version in order to have a product to present. They also want to make a version with images, since the developer is much more comfortable drawing than coding.</p><p>DEVELOPER NOTE: There's currently not a visual indication of it in the game besides if you check the stat page, but certain actions increase \"madness\" or \"mysticism\", and if \"madness\" reaches 3 you get a bad ending. I was gonna indicate increased madness with visuals and I\u00a0ran out of time.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:17:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec6/ec6debd7eb4892565b240f8a282fe3f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JasperDProfio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
