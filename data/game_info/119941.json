Made for wizard jam 4, the idle thumbs community game jam, held from November 19th 2016 at 9:00 PM to December 5th 2016.</p>\n<p>The game works only on windows and is controlled with the mouse and left mouse button. The 'sausage creator' doesn't actually do anything in-game. It's just a for-fun thing to mess around with the different facial features. Scores also aren't saved.</p>\n<p>Since I recently got the game maker html5 module, I added a html5 version that can be played within a web browser. The resolution options don't work correctly with that version, though. Sorry about that! I'll try to build in better support in future games.</p>\n<p>music<br/>\"clowning around\" from http://www.freesfx.co.uk<br/>\"Goofy Mischief\" by Eric Matyas, www.soundimage.org</p>\n<p>sound effects<br/>duck sounds from \"Duck Quacking Outdoors\", http://www.freesfx.co.uk<br/>other sound effects made with http://www.bfxr.net/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/482/482251edf62b0f3ba68230abaf8a5178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Teljoor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
