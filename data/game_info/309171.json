Guide towering, tumbling fishtanks toward matching exit tiles in an increasingly frantic fever-dream of puss-based-puzzling.<br/><br/>Sqvishy is a fast-paced action/puzzle game of visualization, forward-planning and sharp reflexes. Giant fishtanks spawn at the edges of a randomly generated grid and begin to roll... By switching the directions of the grid tiles your puzzled-puss can guide these colorful cages to matching exit tiles. For every fishtank freed you score a point, but for each one lost - either through collision with another fishtank or by rolling onto an edge - a point is deducted. You must reach a certain number of points to clear a level. There are six levels - newly generated each time you play - with exits, fishtank colors and spawns randomized. Find a level of difficulty that suits you and get puzzling!<br/><br/>Features<br/><ul><li>Six Levels of Difficulty </li><li>Customizable Colors </li><li>Full Controller Support </li><li>Customizable Controls </li><li>Cosmic Rainbows! </li></ul><br/>Sqvishy will soon be appearing in original minigame form inside \"The Light Keeps Us Safe\".<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/853240/The_Light_Keeps_Us_Safe/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f2/2f2a75545c34cbd63b3f2b5713d3027e.jpg", "website": "http://www.jamesmakesgames.co.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Makes Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["James Makes Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
