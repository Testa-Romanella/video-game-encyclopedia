But, I don't think I will ever make any games like this again. If you enjoy this, I highly recommend going to Replit and you will find possibly much better text-adventure games. I am currently planning on releasing a Unity3D game inspired by FNAF &amp; Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion so yeah look forward to that i guess.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T10:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/706/706bafdb59492ba2a99ef09fee5842dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScribblesINK"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
