{"id": 269247, "slug": "a-legionarys-life-demo", "name": "A Legionary's Life - Demo", "name_original": "A Legionary's Life - Demo", "description": "<p>Set during the Second Punic War and beyond, <em>A Legionary's Life</em> lets you play as a Roman conscript soldier. Try to be a hero, rise up through the ranks, get rich through ruthless pillaging or just focus on making it home in one piece; it's up to you.</p>\n<p>This is a single-player game with RPG elements, extensive usage of attribute and skill checks, a turn-based combat system involving many variables (including morale, reach, confined space and high ground) and a touch of roguelike features. Among them: <em>permadeath</em>. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it means you'll have to start over if your character dies; but don't worry, the game is designed to be replayable and you'll see only a fraction of it in each run. Also, in future versions you'll be able to spend points on character creation based on how well your best character performed.</p>\n<p>The demo includes the first three parts of the game.</p>\n<p>The full game is currently under development.</p>\r\n A little word of advice for new players. \r\n<p>This game is not supposed to be easy. At the beginning, you are a fresh recruit sent to war in a time of dramatic crisis, with as much training as you could be given in a few months, which means not so much, and no previous combat experience.<br/>It does not mean that the game will be unreasonably difficult; it just means that you should play as if you really were that recruit. Do not expect to cut through the enemy lines like a hot knife through butter.<br/>Remember that the most daring choices will (usually) be the most rewarding, but a much higher risk is involved.<br/>Especially in your first combat, <strong>make sure to read the tooltips</strong>, including the one about the character Stats. <strong>Do not let your Stance drop too much</strong> or you\u2019ll become a lot more vulnerable and <strong>do not expose yourself without a good reason</strong>. Always <strong>look at the indicators </strong>under each available action: the more the sword tip is pointing upwards, the higher your chance of success (I\u2019ll replace the sword with a thumb in a future version).</p>\n<p>You may not be able to kill even a single enemy in your first battle; don\u2019t get discouraged: it\u2019s normal, you\u2019ll get a lot better with practice. If you are careful enough, you should be able to survive this battle even if you spent your time very poorly during the previous \u201clull\u201d phase.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e92/e9219572646ffe9999103fbe01554334.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A.
