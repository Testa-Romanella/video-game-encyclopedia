Not bad, though :) maybe a tad ambitious for 4 days.<br/><br/>Dodge, place, purchase and sell towers in your way to glory. And if you're extra brave, you can attempt the post game mode ;)</p>\n<p>We put a lot of hard work into this, would love for people to play it, give thoughts and feedback, if you do so I'll throw myself at your game and give it a good go.<br/><br/>IF ANYONE COMPLETES THE POST GAME MODE. LET. ME.
