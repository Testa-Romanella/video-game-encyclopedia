I've been wanting to make one of those endless platformers where you jump up a tower for a while now, and I've started putting that into action. Controls are either A and D or arrow keys and space to jump. I'm also working on getting it to building to WebGL, but in the meantime it'll have to wait. If you have any feedback, then\u00a0<strong>please\u00a0</strong>comment with it down in the comments. I have uploaded all of the builds that I have made so far (I recommend going for the latest one but you can decide) and I will be making a devlog for each of the builds. With that said, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T03:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f53024304dc025d5c2e809428abe9eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrazyGamingGuy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
