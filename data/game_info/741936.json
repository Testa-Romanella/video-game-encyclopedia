You can \"overload\" a spot on the grid with multiple tiles to earn more points.</p>\n\n<p>Do note, however, that you cannot place the main patterned tile on another pattern tile.</p>\n\n<p>~~~</p><p>There are also other rules you must follow listed on the left of the screen! However, if you wish to be a little chaotic, you can change the rules. But remember, too much chaos can end up biting you in the butt!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T05:01:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a290871c40cfddebe35b1c95c24abd61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["apolaes"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
