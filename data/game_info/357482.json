It features \u00a04 separate stories about the main characters, Sakuma, Claris, and Jackson, being teleported to a mysterious castle and finding themselves separated from each other. The game features light puzzle elements but is meant to mainly be an interactive story.<br/></p>\n<p>There will be points in which you will need to reset the game. To do this, simply refresh the tab in your browser.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Z=A Button, Enter=Start Button, Directional Keys for movement\r\n</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Chris Maltby for creating GB Studio.
