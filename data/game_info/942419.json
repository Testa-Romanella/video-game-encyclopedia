Defnight is a combination of multiple games that I have played, with a pixel art style. :)</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Your objective is to survive for as long as you can. Before the start of the game, you can choose a map, character, and difficulty (more characters coming in the future). The game is split into waves of monsters, with different types of monsters and difficulties. Wave 10 is a boss fight :). To attack, simply hold down the left mouse button and try to get close to the monster you are attacking. Hold down shift to sprint. When you reach a new level, you can choose which attribute to level up. At levels 5 and 10, you can upgrade to a new class with abilities (activated with the right mouse button). Press \"E\" to enter the shop to buy some boosts. :D</p>\r\nKeybinds\r\n<ul><li>WSAD - Movement</li><li>LMOUSE - Attack (hold to attack)</li><li>RMOUSE - Ability (requires level 5+)</li><li>E - Shop</li><li>LSHIFT - Sprint</li><li>ESC - Pause menu</li></ul>\n\n<p>Feel free to explore the source code and different monsters in the game! :D<br/>https://github.com/Piterson25/Defnight</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T16:02:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d89/d89685629d18d44844dbb1d30cffe1e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piterson25"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
