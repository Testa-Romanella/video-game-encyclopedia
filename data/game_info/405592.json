Yes, the community really plays a role in this, a big part!</p>\n<p>I have made a kind of alpha number 1 game of baldi's basics free exclusive edition, with hidden events everywhere. Some of them are hidden by riddles and tricks so complicated and deviant and so dark that my mind will not have the chance to find them alone! That's why, at the beginning of the one-day broadcast of Baldi's Basics fans, I'm going to launch the alpha game (obviously free) on itch.io, GameJolt, indieDB and gamebanana, giving ALL several hours to play the game. Play and look for secrets! That way, when mediagamesguide plays it, everyone can bombard it with the secrets to find the most valuable prizes, as well as any other advice or trick he has discovered! Whatever the total of that if a fan at the end of its quality transmission, that's how much I have to donate!</p>\n<p>Of course, there will be some guidelines for this. I will post the rules for this next week and update those guidelines and rules until the transmission begins, so all of this is subject to change as the project evolves.</p>\n<p>But one thing is for sure, you'll be playing a role! The Baldi's Basics community and everyone who wants to help will be the first to get the game, so it's up to you to find the secrets, the treasures and the great prizes!</p>\n<p>Now, I know that I have done some furtive things before (like writing 31871 in version 1.4.1 of baldis basics), but I will admit that I have overcome myself here and, honestly, they do not have many possibilities. I feel pretty sure that I won't have to donate much, and I can keep my cash. You may have to give up $ 9,000, $ 1,000,000. But just for the sake of the conversation (not that this is possible for any of you), will I donate up to half a million dollars if MediaGamesGuide can find it.</p>\n<p>We see today :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T22:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85f/85f7deba0dbf674f2b723e38a7cf87b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["XGames9000"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
