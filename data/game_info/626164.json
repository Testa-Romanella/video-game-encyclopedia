The theme was Clockwork. This game fits the theme as the player has to complete the level of the game within a time limit.<br/></p>\n<p>The player is encouraged to collect coins to upgrade their skills in order to complete the game. To achieve victory, the player must defeat the final boss. However, if the player dies along the way or fails to complete the level within the time limit, the player will have to restart the level. However, before restarting, the player has the chance to spend the coins they collected on upgrades to increase their chances of success.<br/></p>\n<p>On The Clock is spiritually inspired by the game Johnny Upgrade. <br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:02:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/375/37548e1bd8a408dff934ffb78c0b793f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["D-Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
