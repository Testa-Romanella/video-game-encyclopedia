I mean Privateer game</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Ready to set sail?</p>\n<p>DOWNLOAD LINK: https://sidequestvr.com/app/1339/sail</p>\n<p>Current version of SAIL allows you explore islands, sail a ship and look for loot. It's VR so feel free to walk around the deck, fire the cannon and adjust the sails. You will also find weapons hidden around the map, if you're having a hard time finding them try breaking those crates you see lying around.</p>\n<p><strong>The map keeps expanding and currently there are 4 areas to explore.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Shipwreck Island is home to the long dead captain still guarding his chest. His massive abandoned war ship lies broken on the rocks of this captain's final resting place.</li><li>Monolith pass is a great place to test your sailing skills. With huge obstacles and another warship it gives new sailors an excellent chance to see what their vessel is capable of. You can also climb to the top of the highest peak to see the lowly prisoner that was hung out for his crimes.</li><li>Isla Fortuna is a small port town where every sailor starts their quest. With it's grand docks and shops it will soon become the center of all things in the Sail economy.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>What's the plan with SAIL?</strong><br/>Checkout G119's interview with AscendVR:</p>\n<p>SAIL is the start of a VR universe G119 (developer) has wanted to make for years.
