Be careful though because without his heart, his body is very fragile, and with every step, he will crack until he eventually shatters. It is up to you to reunite him to his heart in as few moves as possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I hope you all enjoy this game and please inform me of any glitches or bugs in this game and I will get on them asap. Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T03:46:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab59066b47f09e99b2fd6b5987398f10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ace Productions"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
