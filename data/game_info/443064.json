An update is yet to be known.</p>\n<p>We could complete it, but only if a number of people would want it. ;)</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Movement: WASD</p>\n<p>Interact: Enter</p>\n<p>Pause/Exit: Esc</p>\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<p>Windows - Windows XP (or higher), DirectX 9</p>\n<p>Unzip anywhere and play!</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Design: @jespression</p>\n<p>Programming: @Lagiosphere</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0@Lumena_tan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T03:03:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40b/40bc939adb893ecc2b30dd70f1b528ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kubo Bros.
