This description was contradicted by natural historian Ole Worm, who accepted that lemmings could fall out of the sky, but claimed that they had been brought over by the wind rather than created by spontaneous generation.\u201d\r\n  \r\n\u201cAnother myth may have roots in the fiercely aggressive nature of lemmings during population booms, and the corresponding leftovers of predatory frenzies: lemmings do not explode.\"\r\n  \r\n<p>(read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemming)\r\n  </p>\n<p>So, yeah, my Munchies fell out from the sky, they are being created by spontaneous generation, they die suddenly, but first of all they DO explode! :D<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Please share your feedback :)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Contest!</strong></p>\n<p>How many Munchies can you have on a screen before you crash the game? :D</p>\n<p>My friend managed to spawn 1005!

I'm learning game programming/designing/making since February when I lost my job and I decided that it's time to make my biggest wish come true - so to make video games :) <br/></p>\n<p>I'm learning from guys from GameDev.tv (Unity 2D, Math and Gimp courses) and from different YouTube creators like GMTK.\r\n  \u00a0My main experience with games (besides playing them since forever) was organizing LARP games for pretty big part of my life. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>--------------------------------------------- About my experience during this Jam</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I was doing this Game Jam alone, but I had friends as my consulting partners and my girlfriend as a constant support ;) I also used a lot of free assets which I linked below this description.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0It was crazy two weeks. I spent first 7-8 days on making prototypes of different games and the I realized that I should start to work, so I chose the idea that was at this moment developed the most. \r\n  </p>\n<p>I knew that I want to focus on <strong>pickups </strong>and that sometimes they give you something good, sometimes something bad, but also that something what\u2019s at first moment looked good, then appears not so! Or opposite :D\r\n  </p>\n<p>So that was my approach to the theme.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I also wanted to create something light, easy and kind of silly. And this is how Munchies were borned :)\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>In this Game Jam the most surprising and hard for me were limits of my own body. Literally, after first few days of going to sleep at 3 am, after hours of coding and looking in the computer screen, I started to have pains in wrists, knees, spine and even in chest! My eyes were super tired and I felt that this \"crunch\" style of working is definitely not doing well for me. That's for sure first big lesson for me if I want to work in this industry where as we know crunch is often normal thing.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I also learned a lot (even though guys from GameDev.tv already showed me thousands of useful things in their courses). How important is to teach player your own game, how important are visual and sound feedbacks and for sure how AMAZINGLY important is to plan your work. Anyway, anyhow, but always to have a general plan for next few days, and detailed plan for a current day. You can change it, forgot about it, fulfill it or not, but you need it if not for making your work more organized, then at least for being calm and for your mental comfort. For this feeling \u201cyes, I can do it in time\u201d.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I really would like to hear some feedback because I like this concept and I want to continue work on it to make it a full game. I think it can be a nice, light and quick mobile game. Feel free to share your opinions, ideas and advices :)\u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Free content (big thanks for all the creators!)<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Assets\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/simplistic-low-poly-nature-93894</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/3d-items-free-wand-pack-46225#content</li><li><p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/jelly-shader-106980<br/></p></li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/simple-fx-cartoon-particles-67834</li></ul><p>\u00a0Fonts\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>https://www.dafont.com/monster-game.font\r\n  </li><li>https://www.dafont.com/munch-munch.font\r\n  </li><li>https://www.dafont.com/lexia-readable.font\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Music <br/></p>\n<ul><li><p>https://www.jamendo.com/track/1490498/polka_season \u00a0 <br/></p></li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/cheerful-1-choro-bavario-happy-loop\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>Sounds <br/></p><ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/BigKahuna360/sounds/160421/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/444491/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Glaneur%20de%20sons/sounds/30187/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/joedeshon/sounds/266019/</li><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/interface-sounds<br/>\r\n\r\nhttps://kenney.nl/assets/music-jingles</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/OwlStorm/sounds/151212/</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/foley/water-splash-pack-14039</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/thunder-sound-set-volume-1-56530</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:54:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2b/c2b87db5d01fcfd3095a902842772814.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
