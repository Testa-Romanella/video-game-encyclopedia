{"id": 571490, "slug": "marine-litter", "name": "Marine Litter", "name_original": "Marine Litter", "description": "<p>Marine debris is a growing environmental problem. It is widely distributed at the sea surface, on the\u00a0sea bed\u00a0and on shorelines. Around 75% of this litter is plastic, with other materials such as glass and metal representing only a small proportion of litter in the oceans. Nearly 700 species are known to encounter marine litter, with many reports of physical harm resulting from entanglement in and ingestion of plastic.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p> It  is widely acknowledged that plastic litter does not belong in the  ocean. It is also clear that the numerous societal benefits that are  derived from everyday use of plastics can be achieved without  the need for emissions of plastic waste to the environment. Around 8%  of world oil production is currently used to make plastic items and  there is recognition that we need to change the way we produce, use and  dispose of plastic items. In this regard a solution  to two major environmental problems, our non-sustainable use of fossil  carbon (to produce plastics) and the accumulation marine litter probably  lie in utilizing end-of-life plastics as a raw material for new  production. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T09:41:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c96/c9633f04a21242becd2e589b62bd2a3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rhys Lamble"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
