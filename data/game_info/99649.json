What you see is the <strong>only</strong> world that exists - if you go back where you came from - things aren't the same. The world canvas <strong>doubles as player health</strong> - shrinking down if you idle for too long or take damage from enemies. <strong>Refill</strong> your world by destroying enemies with a collection of badass guns and rushing for health drops.</p><p><em>Gamepad highly recommended! </em></p>Controls<p>Xbox360 / Xbox One Controller</p><ul><li>Left Analog Stick - MOVE</li><li>Right Analog Stick - SHOOT</li><li>A - SELECT</li></ul><p>Keyboard and Mouse</p><ul><li>WASD / Arrow Keys - MOVE</li><li>Mouse Left Click - SHOOT / SELECT</li></ul>Credits<ul><li>twitter.com/jushiip Code, Art</li><li>twitter.com/ZHAL9k Code, Shader Magic</li><li>twitter.com/MrJoshuaMcLean Music</li></ul>Tools Used<ul><li>Unity</li><li>3ds Max</li><li>LabChirp</li></ul><p>Quantum Catburetor - Gameplay Video<br/></p><p>OST @ Soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/joshuamclean17/quantum-catb...<br/></p> WARNING: DIZZINESS / PHOTOSENSITIVITY / EPILEPSY SEIZURES <p>A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights.
