I am not sure. Is this a tool? No, but I might be one for making this...<br/>Anyway, this is a fun little experiment I made to play with procedural content generation.\u00a0</p>\r\nWhat's with it?\r\n<p>The pizza model and material are completely procedurally generated, based on the player's input (given through the \"Customize\" tab). The \"Toppings\" tab was added to add a fun mechanic to the experiment and to try out a quick asset-making technique I had running through my mind...and also add some juiciness to the whole thing.</p>\r\nHow does it work?\r\n<p>I will soon publish a devlog with the explanation if you are interested in the process behind the \"game\".</p>\r\nThe assets\r\n<p>I added the option to buy the food assets that I used for as little as 1.00 \u20ac (circa 1.18$, the lowest possible price here on itch) in case you want to download them and support the studio and the experiment.<br/>The asset use is free for personal, educational and commercial use. Credit is not mandatory but is appreciated (You might also leave a comment here and let me know, I'm curious to see where these are used).</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The programming, 3d assets &amp;\u00a0textures were made by PunkPebbleStudio's own Pietro \"Peetah\" Moroni.</p>\n<p>The great UI graphics were made from Kenney (www.kenney.nl).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:33:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68e/68ec7c0b0e10b07f14628a397a9d87b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PunkPebbleStudio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
