The objective is to get to the green and blue striped squares.  The ? doesn't work for now.  </p><p>WASD or Arrow Keys to Move.  Click the buttons to fire or use health kits (once you've picked them up.)</p><p>There are three 'achievements' you can get while you make your way to the objective:</p><p>1. Use no Health Kits and make it to the objective.</p><p>2. Kill everyone and survive to the objective.</p><p>3. Pacifist: Kill no-one and survive to the objective.</p><p>Getting all those, it will probably only take you a couple minutes.  So consider this release a Ground Zeroes to the coming Phantom Pain...
