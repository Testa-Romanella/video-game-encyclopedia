Orders are shown on the noticeboard.\u00a0 According to the theme of the VR Jam, everything in here is one-time-usable. You plant seeds to grow a plant, use plant fruits to create a small potion, then use potions to create a big potion, which is finally needed to fulfill a one-time-only order.<br/></p>\n\n<p>There are five randomly chosen orders of either one big potion, one big and a small potion or two big potions. The more potions the order has, the more money you get.<br/></p>\n\n<p>In order to mix a potion, you need first to plant seeds, so plants grow and provide the necessary fruits for the base potions. <br/></p>\n\n<p>How a certain potion is mixed can be checked at the wall, where the recipes are. <br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>Once a plant has grown, you can grab the fruit and put it into one of the two juicer. You'll get a corresponding small potion.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n<p>Usually you have to mix two different small potions in order to get one of the big potions according to the recipe. To do so, you have to plug them into the mixer. <br/></p>\n\n<p>If you received the potion from the mixer, you just need to drop it into the basket below the noticeboard, where the orders are shown. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>If you have to drop two potions (e.g., one big and one small) then you need to do this one at a time. Once the order is fulfilled, you'll get more score and the next order shifts to the right.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Have fun mixing :)</p>\n<p><strong>Some notes :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Please put potions into deposit box <strong>one by one</strong> </li><li><strong>Colors of potions on recipe posters and notice board do not necessarily correspond to the actual shaded color of the potion itself</strong>. This is because the shader color always looks a bit different. Please stick to the names.</li><li>There was no time to implement a Game Menu anymore in time.
