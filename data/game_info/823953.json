A prototype/proof of concept/vertical slice. I wanted to experiment with health regen in a twitch/arena/boomer shooter style game. I don't see health regen used in any of those styled games at all and is attributed as a modern game trope.<br/><br/>Backstory (ignoreable, just to provide story context): At Illumi mechanics, a robotics company that does military work, a disillusioned scientist is plotting to turn their robots rogue to wipe out humanity. One of his collegues hears of this plan, and works on an experimental new robot as a counter measure. This robot is unique as it is likely the first robot to use a new technologies such as true AI sentience, nanobot regeneration and high mobility systems. This robot is then ran through combat tests against the existing robot models, to ensure it is sufficient to repel the rogue robot forces.<br/><br/>Controls and credits listed in game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T10:58:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/934ff7b6518c5818ca7f5005cf62e238.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DC_235"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
