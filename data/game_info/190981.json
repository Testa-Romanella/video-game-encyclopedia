I wanted to prototype an idea I had for a small AR app but due to time constraints I\u00a0took the basic mechanics and created a simple take on Flippy Knife.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>LMB - <strong>Click</strong> and\u00a0<strong>hold</strong> the <strong>left mouse button </strong>end <strong>swipe</strong> in the direction you want the knife to travel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0*** The knife speed is not affected by the speed of your swipe but by the distance across the screen your mouse travels.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Aim of the game</strong></p>\n<p>You get 5 weapons which you use to get the highest score possible. Smaller targets yield more points than larger targets and the centre of a target is worth more than the outside.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, Art &amp;\u00a0Animation: Rob Brooks</p>\n<p>Audio:\u00a0https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/pro-sound-collection</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/300/3006a5d598b6d06e6401c1fd982778fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobBCreates"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
