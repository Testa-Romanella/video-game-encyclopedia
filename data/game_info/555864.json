To generate the Sierpinski triangle, the point jumps towards 1 of the 3 vertices at random by a factor of 1/2. The Sierpinski carpet requires additional vertices at the midpoints of the four edges and jumps between these vertices by a factor of 2/3. The Sierpinski pentagon is generated by jumping between the 5 vertices by a factor of 1/phi. Note: There is currently a bug making the pentagon draw improperly in some color modes.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Z - Pause/Resume</li><li>X - Cycle through fractal shapes</li><li>Left/Right - Change color mode</li><li>Up/Down - Change speed</li></ul>\n<p>If you found this interesting you might also like my recreation of Conway's Game of Life.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:21:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/836/83688036ab3e697e8bf19fc066998340.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jonathan Hunter"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
