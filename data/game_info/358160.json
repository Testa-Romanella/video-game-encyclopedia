Read the green exactly for success.<br/><br/>Note:<br/>I am a hobbyprogramer, so I can not test the program for every Android and Deviceconfigurations and make it waterproofed  for all.Please bear with me if it did not run on your device.<br/>(You can get a refund within 2 hours after purchasing at Google Play Store.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately I am not able to reply on any google crashreports without leaving your email inside.<br/>So please feel free to send feedback per  &gt;&gt;&gt;E-Mail&lt;&lt;&lt;  if you had problems, ideas or wishes!<br/><br/>Known issues: In some few cases the game does not run after UPDATING ANDROID. Then please uninstall the game and install it again.<br/><br/>Have fun and a nice game! <br/><br/>Hints for golfing newcomers:<br/>- its hard to play<br/>- use menu/settings to adjust difficulty for hitting,putting and wind<br/><br/>- 2 Swingmodes:<br/>1. EasySwing: default (New! Better precision for slower devices. No influence of DownSwingSpeed)<br/>2. ProSwing: selectable in settings (As you know from 2.91! Better for more intuition because of Influence of DownSwingSpeed)<br/><br/>- unlock new items and THE NEW COURSE in tournament  (if you reach place 1-3) <br/>- play against your own playback in ShadowPlay mode<br/>- drag straight down on the swingpanel and then up for swinging (use straight drag to avoid slice or hook)<br/>- drag the 3D Button for a better overview<br/>- use the Putter on the Green,Driver only on Tee, and Woods only on Tee or Fairway<br/>- while putting have a look at the GreenBreakIndicator (the little white stick)<br/>- use the Greenreader Button<br/>- use the Sandwedge in Bunker<br/>- avoid Rough (-33% ballspeed and ca. 50%-60% ballrange)<br/>- if you are in water or Out, you get an penalty and have to rehit<br/>- the biggest club is not always the best<br/>- use backspin with the short clubs to reduce roll on green (works best with Lobwedge)<br/>- Joke cheats:<br/>- enter MOON for your name to get moongravity<br/>- enter STICKMAN to play with a stickman golfer<br/><br/>*** Thanks to all feedbackers and betatesters***<br/>*** Thanks for Mosync SDK (the programing language)***<br/>*** Thanks for purebasic (I write the Editor with it)***<br/><br/>Play like a tiger, have fun and become a golf star ....<br/>R.Werner", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T05:57:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa1/fa1e1edaa1228ec7271d55bff8855564.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Ru.Werner"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
