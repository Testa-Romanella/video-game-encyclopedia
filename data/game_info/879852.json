She coded everything and I did the artwork. We had a great time together even if we mostly spent hours on our own computers without saying a word to each other. There are still many things to improve but we are both happy and proud of the result!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>\u25ba Music Credit: LAKEY INSPIRED Track Name: \"Blue Boi\" Music By: LAKEY INSPIRED @ https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired Original upload HERE - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAukv...
