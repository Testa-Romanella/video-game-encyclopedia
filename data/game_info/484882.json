{"id": 484882, "slug": "corruption-of-champions-ii", "name": "Corruption of Champions II", "name_original": "Corruption of Champions II", "description": "<p>Corruption of Champions II (or CoC2 for short) is a text-based adventure game in which you contend with an invasion of perverse demons into your home realm, all the while romancing hot monstergirls (and furries, orcs, elves, demons, and all sorts of other cuties) and transforming yourself into your ideal physical form. CoC2 is a game about customization, letting you play whatever kind of character you want: whether you&#39;re a busty bimbo bandit or a chiseled lupine barbarian; a hermaphroditic cowgirl sorceress specialized in milk-magic, or a burly orc warpriest who intimidates his companions back into the fight.<br />\nNo matter what you choose to transform yourself into, you&#39;ll be accompanied on your perverse adventures by a group of eclectic companions, from catgirl clerics and kitsune sorceresses, to chastity-caged elf dickgirls and domineering orc amazons. You can lead two of these companions at a time against a world full of lustful enemies and corrupted magics, building up your party and your own Champion&#39;s talents to bring to bear countless combinations of strengths and weaknesses against your demonic foes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-18T09:27:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b97/b973ef1fad7366fb5e9dcefa32d916ae.jpg", "website": "https://www.fenoxo.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 28, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 76, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Salamander Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Salamander Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
