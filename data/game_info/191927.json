It's available on a \"name your price\" format so you can try the full game first and then decide how much it's worth. If you choose not to pay for it, that's okay too! Any amount is appreciated!\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that this game is local multiplayer only!</p>\n<p>The Help section included in the game will probably answer any questions you have.</p>\n<p><em>ahem</em>\u00a0List of important functions that the game won't tell you about because it's a secret and definitely not because I forgot about them:</p>\n<ul><li>You can click with your mouse directly in most buttons;</li><li>ESC closes the game;</li><li>F1 restarts the game;</li><li>F4 toggles fullscreen.</li></ul>\n<p>A few final notes:</p>\n<ul><li>I am only one guy doing this for the first time.<br/>There is a lot of stuff that I have no idea what I am doing.</li><li>The game doesn't support gaming controllers, but if you have any I encourage you to get some software to map the inputs to the keys. Keyboards don't usually like it when someone presses too many keys at the same time. Also, not an optimal solution, but you can also use multiple keyboards to avoid this issue.</li><li>Compatibility testing was very limited since I have a very decent laptop that runs the game perfectly. However, on a low end laptop I got 30 fps on the menus and inconsistent 60 fps during battles. On another low end laptop I got inconsistent 60 fps all around. It really seems to depend on the PC, but unless you're trying to run the game on a notebook you probably won't have many problems... hopefully. Future updates might improve performance.</li><li>The game is available in English, Spanish and Portuguese.</li><li>I wrote all the text and translations and at some point I got numb to the typos.</li><li>Feel free to contact me regarding any bug that you find or just to give me some feedback on the game!</li></ul>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbe/fbe012ed50cc589b45e67790358beef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KryptonLion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
