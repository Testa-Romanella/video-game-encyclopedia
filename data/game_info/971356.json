Your task is to diagnose and cure the patient using the available tools, ingredients, recipes and books. This is a difficult game against time, misdiagnosis and procrastination can lead you to the stake, and every choice has consequences.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Well, what can you do? At first, your methods are scarce - drain blood, amputate a rotten finger. But over time, you become increasingly sophisticated, learning therapeutic treatments and surgical skills. Eventually, you face the horror of black death and put on a plague doctor mask.<br/><br/><ul><li>The visual style of the game is pleasing to the eye. Each model is lovingly hand-drawn on paper.<br/></li><li>Real diseases and authentic treatments. The bloodletting? Leeches? Yes, please. And don't forget a blow to the head instead of anesthesia.<br/></li><li>Lovable characters. Our favorite is the parish priest in a deep depression. It is recommended to treat it with St. John's wort.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>All events of the game take place in a fictional universe. Please do not use the healthcare skills acquired in the game on real people - it is dangerous and can cause harm to life and health.<br/>Always contact a specialist!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T14:40:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2e/c2ea0fa9ac6c2a8d5df5cf96b68718a8.jpg", "website": "https://www.plaguedoc.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["CosCom Art Group"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CosCom Art Group"], "esrb_rating": null}
