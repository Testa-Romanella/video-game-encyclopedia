Each weapon will be found in a different elemental based environment. These three elements consist of Fire, Ice, and Wind. There will also be 5 levels consisting of a hub world, three elemental levels, and a final boss level. At the end of each level the player will have to fight a mini boss of the same element as the weapon they collected in that level. The elemental weapons will be used to make the bosses go into their vulnerable stage. When the bosses aren't in the vulnerable stage they can't be harmed by basic attacks. The final boss level will be an enemy of all three elements.</p>\n<p>Created by: Tyler Hicks, Jason Sturm, and Simon Wu in Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T03:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/beb/beb15ab7633efbb0f5627b2bb3bb8ba6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UnityFES"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
