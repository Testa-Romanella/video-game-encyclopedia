Its very basic and not too difficult, but has a tiny bit of depth to it. I hope you like it!</p>\r\nPLEASE READ:\r\n<p>Please read the following information as this game has no control page or help menu.\u00a0</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<p>i - open inventory</p>\n<p>o - attack</p>\n<p>wasd - move around the map</p>\r\nImportant Elements:\r\n<p>You control a hero shown as the brown square. Engage in a battle against an enemy by walking next to them.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>When in a battle, press \"o\" to attack. The enemy will then also attack. After this, you may attack again. Sometimes you will deal no damage; this is because you missed your attack.</p>\n<p>The large grey square at the centre of each area is a town. Walk into it to heal yourself (this may only be done once per town). While in a town, you may open your inventory to see a shop where you can buy more weapons.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>After defeating all enemies, you may walk to the border of the world to enter the next area.<br/></p>\n<p>Each different colour of enemy is slightly different, wielding different types of weapons and health levels.</p>\n<p>When in your inventory, you may click on any of your weapons to select them. This can also be done mid-battle.</p>\r\nTypes of Weapons:\r\n<p>There are three different types of weapons. All weapons deal damage given as a number on their icon, however, some have special effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Normal Weapons:\u00a0</strong>The white-coloured weapons. Standard in nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire Weapons:\u00a0</strong>The orange-coloured weapons. Once an enemy is hit, they will continue to take a portion of the weapon's damage as fire damage each turn, regardless of whether you hit them or not. This makes fire weapons a good choice against enemies wielding poisonous weapons.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Poisonous Weapons: </strong>The purple-coloured weapons.\u00a0Poisonous weapons significantly lower the opponent's accuracy. It is usually a good idea to make your first attack with a poison weapon and then switch to one with higher damage.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Also I forgot to change the title before compiling :P\r\n</p>\n<p>My next game will hopefully be a bit more polished.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T16:36:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04edd6571134102c93408563479eb90d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spookso"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
