And, of course, it has started to conduct experiments on the creation of biological weapons there. Everything is happening in the best traditions of such organisations: there are white tents everywhere, corn fields, airplanes with pesticides and people in chemical suits. One small mistake is enough. One time the pesticide gets sprayed over the civilian fields and this leads to a local biological disaster. <br/><br/>An old marine Marvin Prods gets caught in the center of the events, as well as his neighbor's granddaughter, Lilith De Buansche, who came to the place on vacation. The Old man never liked his neighbor, as well as people in general. But the laconic neighbor\u2019s granddaughter was able to become the old man\u2019s soul mate. She often helped him in the barn, looked after the greenhouse and loved to tinker with scrap in the old cabin. <br/><br/>One day the girl was listening  as usual to something she caught on the radio, some talks of the pilots who flew to irrigate the fields with secret pesticides. This time they mumbled and growled something, and then she heard an explosion from her farm. Lilith ran out towards the farm and saw her grandfather lumbering clumsily towards her, a green tint on his skin. He muttered gibberish for some time and finally pulled his hands toward the girl to try and choke her, but at that moment a pitchfork had struck his side - old man Marvin arrived just in time. True, but the girl herself was too not a sissy, and when she rushed out into the street, she grabbed a shotgun lying under the table in the cabin so she hastened to discharge a shot into the monster that her former grandfather had become.<br/><br/>\tWhen our heroes decided to get out of the wilderness into the city, they saw that the familiar and hated world they knew was gone, The Wicked one was there instead.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T16:58:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b87ade81117bb1569d576b3894080a47.jpg", "website": "https://www.alienintelligence.lt/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alien Intelligence UAB"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alien Intelligence UAB"], "esrb_rating": null}
