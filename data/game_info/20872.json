As soon as <strong>Amnesia</strong> franchise started to pick up we saw an opportunity for a new mix. The general conception is that as soon as you have weapons to fight with, the horror part of the game fades away. We believe this is incorrect and <strong>Blinding Dark</strong> is our attempt to prove otherwise. Scarce ammunition, powerful enemies and limited options to recover health, creates a lot of tension and fear of death. Pair this up with the fact that there is a serious repercussion when dying and you have the danger / tension element back in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You wake up in an entrance hall of, what seems to be, a mansion. You can't remember who you are and how you got there.<br/>Step by step you adventure into the dark to discover your past and unfold your future. Collect ancient relics and discover what is their unique ability. Take your time and <br/>analyze the surroundings. Throwing yourself head on will often prove to be a deadly mistake.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>audacious combination between horror elements and old-styled first person shooter feeling<br/></li><li>interesting storyline that spans across multiple Acts and has deep roots within the general lore of the Blinding Dark world<br/></li><li>collect unique weapons and items, each with it\u2019s specific use<br/></li><li>survive against hell spawns, demons, monsters and spirits, each with it\u2019s unique strengths and weaknesses to discover and manipulate<br/></li><li>challenge yourself with difficult platforming and puzzle elements<br/></li><li>deep and rewarding exploration of hand-crafted environments, discover its secrets<br/></li><li>high quality graphics and first person full body view perspective</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-23T09:47:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/beb/beb029a52c872bee9b6ffcbe927d665d.jpg", "website": "http://www.blindingdark.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 89, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 399, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Games Hut"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
