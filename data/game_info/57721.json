It was released on the PlayStation in Japan on January 27, 2000, in Europe on March 31, 2000 and in North America on August 30, 2000. It is a spin-off to the Resident Evil video game series (4th overall). A Microsoft Windows version was released only in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>As the first release of the Gun Survivor series, this game was a major difference from the main Resident Evil series, substituting the third-person perspective of the previous games to a first-person view. The Japanese and European versions of the game were compatible with Namco's GunCon/G-Con 45 light gun, making it one of the first off-rail light gun games, whereas light-gun compatibility was removed from the North American release due to shooting games being partly blamed for the motivation of the then-recent Columbine High School massacre.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-17T21:49:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be6/be6a993386e67a52b1a7338187b0a1f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.59, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 20, "beaten": 32, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 15}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 33, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 34, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Tose"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Capcom", "Eidos Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
