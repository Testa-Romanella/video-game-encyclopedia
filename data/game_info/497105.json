The rules are simple: you start at A, and look for a sign that starts with A. Click on it, and you'll move on to B, where you repeat the process. However, if you click on an incorrect sign, you have to start all over from A. Completing the Alphabet Game at Z earns you one point, and you start over from A.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:36:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66f/66ffd3aa3fae32a084939dc29572fefe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Horizon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
