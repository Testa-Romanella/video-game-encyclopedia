The pod can orient itself and take manual inputs, but its pathfinding system\u2019s star charts have been scrambled.\u00a0The player, as Apollo, must\u00a0find the path through the stars using the navigation system\u2019s remaining data as hints.\u00a0Hints are presented as\u00a0particular constellations, which the player must recreate within\u00a0puzzles. The puzzles\u00a0consist of\u00a0grids of stars with\u00a0variations in star shape, size, color, and brightness.\u00a0The target constellation in each puzzle will utilize stars that match, and the player must identify the correct starts to connect.\u00a0Making a mistake in a puzzle will reduce your oxygen supply. If your oxygen supply is reduced to zero, it\u2019s game over.\u00a0Upon completion of the final puzzle, Apollo returns home safely.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Created By Team Igloo</p>\n<p>Project manager: Robert M.</p>\n<p>Text developer: Amorena N.</p>\n<p>Programmers: Erik P,.
