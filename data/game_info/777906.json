As the game was done in less than 10 days it doesn't have much content, but you can still challenge yourself or your friends to beat the best score. You can also add modifiers to make the game experience easier or more difficult.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T17:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6eb48c4e933e7849251210db57aa751a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SWeeb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
