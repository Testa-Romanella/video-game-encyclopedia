A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play<br/></p><p>Almost the same with a Breakout game with few messing around in the gameplay. the Game was created in Unity3D as a mobile game, but just for experiment this is the web build version of the game. it's just a student project game so feel free to test the game (please note) the game still has a few bugs.</p><p>it may require a Unity3D installed</p><p>controls:</p><p>use mouse to move the paddle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/568/568f52b8f8300709d1ec04dcaf787fce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Rainier Dancel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
