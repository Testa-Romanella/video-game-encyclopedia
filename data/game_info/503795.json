With only the ability to drive in circles (you could even say you're\u00a0<em>stuck in a loop</em> *nervous laughter*), you must draw a full circle around objectives to capture them.</p>\n<p>The game has 14 levels of increasing difficulty, and records your best time on each. Try to get a high score!</p>\n<p>If you get performance issues when playing in the browser, please download the executable for your system (source code is also available if you wish to compile from source).</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use A and D to switch steering between left and right (You cannot drive straight!)</li><li>Use W to accelerate and S to reverse</li><li>When you drive in a circle, your car will automatically draw a circle underneath</li><li>Draw a complete circle around the flag to win the level</li><li>If there are floating pips in the level, you must collect all of these first be drawing circles around them.</li></ul>\n<p>Here's my current list of best times.
