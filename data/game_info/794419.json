Your un-named patron has granted you the ability to grow in power based on the number of witches you slay. Your patron's power is limited however as they can only grant these powers upon your defeat. Fear not, as \"Death is only the beginning\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to conquer as many waves as possible, without getting overwhelmed. If you are overwhelmed, then it's game over! Use the freedom to build your character how you like from a wide range of abilities ranging from leeching life while fighting enemies\u00a0to flaming projectiles that fire randomly. How many waves can you defeat before being overwhelmed?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD Movement</li><li>Move your mouse to aim your character</li><li>Left-click to swing your sword</li><li>Space key will toggle in-game audio On/Off</li></ul>\n<p>A<strong>ttributions</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Skeleton Models:\u00a0\u00a0<ul><li>https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kaykit-skeletons</li></ul></li><li>Character Animations:<ul><li>https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kaykit-animations</li></ul></li><li>Environment Models<ul><li>https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kaykit-medieval-builder-pack</li><li>https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kaykit-dungeon</li><li>https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kay-kit-mini-game-variety-pack</li></ul></li><li>Skill Images<ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/skill-item-and-spell-icons</li></ul></li><li>UI - Health Bars<ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/ui-pieces</li></ul></li><li>Sounds<ul><li>Sword:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Merrick079/sounds/568169/</li><li>Background Track: Open Source from\u00a0Monster RPG 2\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/42-monster-rpg-2-music-tracks</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>The logo was created using Adobe Spark (Free)</li></ul>\n<p>Pre-submission change logs are in the Devlog.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Unity 2021.1.15f1 source files are zipped and available for download on this page :).
