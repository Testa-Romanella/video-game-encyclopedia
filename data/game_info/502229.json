Then war and state-sanctioned racism changed everything\u2014he became the enemy. Three generations later, his grandson, artist Randall Okita, leads us on an interactive virtual pilgrimage through an emotional geography of immigration and family to recover what was lost.<br/><br/><strong>The Book of Distance</strong> blends techniques from mechanical sculpture, film, and stage to redefine personal storytelling in virtual reality. Family archives add a haunting layer of realism. 2D and 3D hand-crafted sets reminiscent of Japanese woodblock prints, evocative character design, and seamless choreography combine with surprising moments of interaction to gently whisk us across the ocean and through the years.<br/><br/>Okita invites us to participate in this generous act of imagination: a space of magical theatre and generational echoes.
