{"id": 111776, "slug": "beastie-blocks-beta", "name": "Beastie Blocks (Beta)", "name_original": "Beastie Blocks (Beta)", "description": "<p><strong>Beastie Blocks</strong> is a match 4 puzzle game with a new spin played with only the mouse. It has simple but deep mechanics, is endlessly replayable and I tried to make it as polished and juicy as I could.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I am really sorry that I have not finished making a tutorial for the game yet. Rotate groups of 4 blocks by clicking and holding down your mouse button drawing a triangle shape on adjacent blocks and then releasing after selecting 3. Blocks will rotate either clockwise or counter clockwise based on the direction of your input. The objective of the game is to connect 4 of the same color. You lose if you move a block with the number 0 on it.</em><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>After learning to make games in my free time for years and failing to actually release anything I decided to make this game, which is still in development.</p>\n<p>I chose to make this\u00a0particular\u00a0game because it was the simplest game idea I could think of,\u00a0because I don't like most mobile games, and because I don't like matching puzzle games.</p>\n<p>I would love to hear about any feedback you have, about any bugs you come across or if you just want to share your score! I\u00a0will do my best to continue to improve the game, please help me make my first game as good as possible until I actually manage to release it!</p>\n<p>I really hope you enjoy playing my game;  Thank you for your support, it means the world to me!\u00a0If you did enjoy playing it I would be extremely grateful\u00a0if you took the time to rate the game on itch.io.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p><em>-Spencer Marr @Spennerino</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/390985bc70ec2b8ee6bd05ef93f1dc1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spennerino"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
