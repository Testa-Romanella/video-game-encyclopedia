I didn't quite manage to finish a proper \"game\", but I got something that runs and that you can spend a few minutes playing around in, and if that's not what a Game Jam entry is supposed to be I don't know what is (a proper game).</p>\n<p>Because this game is not using any game engine there are bound to be platform/configuration specific bugs. If you find bugs/crashes I would really appreciate if you could send me your OS version, CPU model, GPU model and graphics driver version to julius_hager@hotmail.com.</p>\n<p>You can move the camera with the WASD keys or pan using right or middle click with a mouse.</p>\n<p>Use left click to both select a tile from the bottom 5 tiles and to place that tile at the correct place. Once that tile is placed you draw a new card from a deck.\u00a0The deck starts with 300 cards and once you've placed them all you've \"succeeded\". Though the only real goal is to have a little fun.</p>\n<p>To be able to place the tile in a specific slot there are some rules:</p>\n<ol><li>The tile needs to neighbor one other tile in a + pattern around the tile (no diagonals)</li><li>The tile need to match it's \"type\" with the placed tiles \"type\". You can't place tile so that a pond abruptly ends with some farmland.</li></ol>\n<p>When you have placed a tile you draw a new tile from the deck.\u00a0</p><p>If you have problems running with \"GMTK2021.exe\" shortcut file either try \"start.bat\" or go directly into the \"bin/Release/net5.0/publish/\" folder and run \"GMTK2021.exe\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:38:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3c39868e0fd1905bb6133aaae1aa6ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Swedishpancaces"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
