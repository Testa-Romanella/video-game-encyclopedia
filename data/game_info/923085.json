A dedicated \u201cShootout\u201d mode is available where you can watch NPCs fight each other or jump into FPS combat whilst using cinematic controls to capture slow-motion gory deaths and blood spilling - there\u2019s nothing more satisfying than turning on slow-motion whilst emptying a full magazine into your enemy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T03:56:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b28/b28fc843def783d2b22f9998cb316f79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio HK"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Studio HK"], "esrb_rating": null}
