Try do as I say.. Otherwise things may not turn out so well..*<br/>This is a virtual reality horror game designed specifically for the HTC Vive, and takes advantage of Room scale to the max. It is based in an underground torture facility.\u00a0<br/>You Physically *walk around* in your play space, and figure out puzzles, whilst you're not alone in that room.\u00a0<br/>A mad psychopath yells instructions at you through speaker systems, whilst you try to follow his instructions, as you know you have the possibility of escape.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>One of the well designed mechanics of this game is that it takes advantages of roomscale. Hiding under tables, in lockers, crawling through tunnels all takes place. This all adds up to a truly immersive and terrifying experience. Heck I even get scared testing it I have to get people to do it for me.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I've decided to put this demo on here before I get it on steam. It would still be free on steam as a demo, but also a longer full version with about 2 hours gameplay for about $1.99. I can't put anything straight on as I need feedback here. Please email me all bugs to my business email in my profile on gamejolt\u00a0so I can fix them! think of anyone playing this as my bug tester :) I hope VR Horror enthusiasts will enjoy this!</p>\n<p>I've made a few others games, such as Buried Beneath, Slender Adrift, Overnight 2 reboot etc. And a couple other cringey VR games. I really hope this turns out well as I have put my blood sweat and tears into this programming haha.\u00a0<br/>And yes, I am 14, so even though i've been programming games for 5 years there may be a few issues. Drop me a tweet/email/comment if you find any as this is the only way I can learn.</p>\n\n<p>Controls-<br/>Interact - Vive Controller Trigger<br/>Teleport (when enabled) - Trackpad (Please note, this game does not support teleportation or trackpad movement as a form of locomotion.
