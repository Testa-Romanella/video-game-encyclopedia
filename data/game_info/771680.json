You can sustain 5 hits.</p>\n<p>The cubes are located at the start of the corridor and at the left side wall (green neon cube).</p>\n<p>If you shoot a bat, your score increases and the game gets harder gradually.</p>\n<p>This is an infinite shooter with no end. It is expected to reach the peak difficulty after 30 bats.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Mouse movement</strong> =&gt; Aim</li><li><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> =&gt; Shoot</li><li><strong>E</strong> =&gt; Switch between the cubes</li><li><strong>R </strong>=&gt; Restart when the game is over</li><li><strong>Alt+F4 </strong>=&gt; Exit</li></ul>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T06:40:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb4/eb433cdc3c38fb69ee93e5b261d9eb47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Movsac"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
