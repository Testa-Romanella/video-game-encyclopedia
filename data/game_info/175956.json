It includes back and forth pixel paddle game play just like the original and comes with three levels of difficulty.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>\"Pretty Good.\"</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Wrestle against your friend while you both try and use the keyboard to play against each other. No fancy over-rated multiplayer malarkey here, folks!</p>\n<p><strong><em>\"Best Pong I've played since Pong.\"</em></strong></p>\n<p>For whatever reason, you might also want to watch the computer play against itself, so you can do that in this game too! You won't be judged if you choose to do this.</p>\n<p><strong><em>\"Meh.\"</em></strong></p>\n<p>The options menu (see screenshot) comes with settings that allow you to tailor your multiplayer games to your own design. You can create a game with one giant slow paddle vs a tiny super fast paddle - you decide!</p>\n<p>http://georgemcdonagh.co.uk/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/908/908be80341286619ab1c08a1f3c9f0b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["George McDonagh"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
