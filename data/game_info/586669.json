However, this perfect balance has been compromised by mysterious entities so that spirits will no longer protect the world.</p>\n<p>A group of brave soldiers wants to shed light on this mystery and try to stop the war that is inevitably going to start. Help the warriors save the world by traveling from the medieval water kingdom, through the\u00a0modern\u00a0thunder kingdom, the ancient fire kingdom, the floating city in the wind kingdom, and much more in this 20+ hours game!</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: the game is 100%\u00a0complete, including optional missions. It is still in development because\u00a0there are some minor bugs and I only tested on few computers. Last but not least, I would welcome any constructive feedback and I may update the game with new features, enhanced storyline, bug fixes depending on how much time I have/priority.</p>\n<p>You can report a bug here\u00a0or leave a comment below.
