In this game, the player enters a utopian society and takes on a middle-aged worker's role. Due to a lack of other skills, the assembly line worker is the only job the protagonist can perform. In this society, every member needs to create enough value. Those who cannot contribute enough value will be sent to a retirement community. Believe me; no one wants to go there. There, only the minimum survival needs will be guaranteed. The player's choices will directly affect the story and its outcome, so please carefully make your choices. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T09:19:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5a/d5a7c3dc27ab20297e1d97beeebaf5dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shan233"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
