Enjoy playing my\u00a0<strong>first game ever</strong>, that I've actually finished... !\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This masterpiece was crafted in around 2 days for\u00a0<strong>AZURE GAME JAM</strong>\u00a0 themed <strong>CHAIN REACTION</strong> hosted by\u00a0Lana Lux\u00a0and Microsoft Azure. It was a bumpy, if not turbulent ride, but it was worth it! I didn't sleep. Still worth it. It is a simple, endless (if you can game), connect the nodes and blow them up kind of game. You can even compete in\u00a0<strong>leaderboards</strong> via a PlayFab account. However it is not required and you can play as guest without the need to log in or creating an account.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ASSETS USED:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>sounds from freesound.org</p>\n<p>music by Ketsa - Freshed from freemusicarchive.org</p>\n<p>graphics (gem pack) by\u00a0Noesteryo</p>\n<p>font from 1001freefonts.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36d/36da73b0878dc3ab076cb7336ba2b7a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["beerdmaan"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
