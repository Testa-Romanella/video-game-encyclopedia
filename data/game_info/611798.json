It only took me less than a\u00a0\u00a0day to finish and only has the three levels. Maybe if people would like more I can make more levels, environments,\u00a0 maybe even new mechanics and make it available on mobile but only time will tell. Hope I gave you at least two mins of enjoyment and may luck be with your side!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:01:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/6560ae1d7d495383c78348588a48976a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Thekingsammy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
