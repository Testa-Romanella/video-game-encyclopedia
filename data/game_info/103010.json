But sometimes he can get dangerously hungry, and running around looking for food only makes him hungrier. Which means bad luck for anybody who ends up crossing his way in the forests.</p><p>Although he doesn't hold a grudge against the punny humans who disturbe his silence with their \"skiing\", Mr. Yeti does like the way all those winter clothes keep their juicy insides warm. Mr. Yeti calls them Burritos on Sticks.</p><p><strong>What? SkiFree??</strong></p><p>Never heard of it.</p>Intructions:<p>-Use WASD to move</p><p>-Catch the human skiers</p><p>-Be careful! Running around makes you hungrier.</p><p>-Don`t starve to death</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/513/5130486a1803055f807069d4a2a5ff7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Big Green Pillow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
