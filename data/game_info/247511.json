The goal is to keep your lamp filled with oil so that the flame continues to burn bright. The oil comes from prayer, scripture study, tithing, and church. Challenge your friends to see who can keep their flame burning the longest.<br/><br/>A great way to help teach the important concepts involved with this important parable.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb7/fb7911ab27ef6d963ee2cbc1bcb8ba47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Aprendium"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Joey Smith"], "esrb_rating": null}
