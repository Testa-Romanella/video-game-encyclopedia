It's been ages now... Decades have passed and the Immortals vanished, one by one they were plucked from their core, each leaving their godforsaken existence behind. Well... except for you. How many centuries must pass? How many lives must you <em>Slaughter</em>. Before you finally get your wish.. and kill the one who cursed you. Will even an Immortal\u00a0find his peace? Only <strong><em>Time </em></strong>will tell.</p>\n<p><strong><em>MECHANICS</em>\u00a0</strong>#</p>\n<p>The main mechanic of our game is <em><strong>The Passing Of time</strong></em>. As the Immortal you fight enemies using\u00a0 weapons specific to the time period you are currently in. Every time you kill someone<em> time passes</em>. As time passes the landscape changes, enemies change, but in the end you grow tired. As different eras come around you get new and stronger weapons, but <em>enemies </em>get<em> stronger and smarter</em> as well.</p>\n<p><strong><em>PLAN FOR THE GAME</em>\u00a0</strong>#<br/></p>\n<p>The idea for our game is to have procedurally generated levels, because we want it to be somewat of a Rougelike, meaning every time you die you will start over. The player will have limited time to explore just like in the game Minit, but he will have to keep in mind as The Passage of Time <strong><em>increases</em></strong>, the time he has <strong><em>to explore decreases</em></strong>, until finally he <strong><em>starts again</em></strong> from scratch reactivating the curse.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>THE\u00a0 GAME JAM\u00a0JOURNEY\u00a0</em></strong>#<br/></p>\n<p>We have made a prototype just to showcase our idea, but you will have to keep an open mind\u00a0because this was in the end made in less than 48 hours. That's about it, hope you enjoy our prototype, any feedback si appreacieated, Bye.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>CREDITS\u00a0</em></strong>#</p>\n<ul><li>Programming - Radenkroft</li><li>Art\u00a0- Jicga</li><li>Audio - Promaja</li><li>Narative - TimmyD</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Pixel\u00a0Art background Pack - Tileset</li><li>Prototype hero Pack - Player Sprites</li><li>Medieval warrior Pack 2 - Enemy Sprites\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>INSPIRATION\u00a0</em></strong>#\u00a0https://www.worldhistory.org/Persian_Immortals/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T12:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccf/ccffecd87bfa915aa1fb26523df359b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["radencroft"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
