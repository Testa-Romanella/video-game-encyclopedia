It was intended to be a cooperative monster hunting game set input a cyberpunk far future. It hit a roadblock when I realized how difficult animating giant monsters and robots would be, as I create all of my art assets myself. After realizing that the scope was too ambitious, I relegated this prototype to a study on platform movement options and physics. This project is on indefinite hiatus.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: Movement</p>\n<p>Left Click: Shoot</p>\n<p>Right\u00a0Click: Grapple hook</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p>Shift: Run</p>\n<p>E: Interact</p>\n<p>Q: Heal</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22f/22f7082adee8727b4f4af40eabf5c96c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blstrManx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
