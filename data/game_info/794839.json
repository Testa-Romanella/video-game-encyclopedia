I used the Unity FPS tutorial, changed the weapon to a shotgun, changed the enemy to a demon and changed its attack. I then created a simple level using models I created and some scripts to control things in the level (door buttons, and triggers. flashing lights, end of level, and a music player). I\u00a0also edited some of the scripts from the FPS tutorial to fit my needs. All textures are free from textures.com some have been edited in photoshop to fit environment. All music is by Ethan Meixsell on the Free audio library on Youtube No Attributions. Sound effects were found on FreeSound.org and under CC0 or have been altered enough in audacity to not be considered the same sound. I used a fire particle effect which was part of a free asset for unity FireExplosionVFX\u00a0\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/fire-explosions/fire-explosi...\u00a0The Demon I\u00a0made using MakeHuman and free Targets from its website. I used Substance painter to put a simple texture on it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T13:40:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/573/573739e3c71a3f6c7a2282873214057b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SilverSwoopGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
