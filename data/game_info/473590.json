The idea is to create a grid using ASCII characters, the program would ask the player to pick a number between 1 and 10 to determine whether the player would go first or not. If the player went first he would be X or vice versa.</p>\n<p>The console would then print out the grid and display \u2018-\u2019 in the spots where X/O would go, when selecting the destination of your next mark the player would choose a location from 1-9.<br/>Two different modes are included, Mode 1 would be two users facing off against each other. Mode 2 would be one user versus the computer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T02:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a80e1424c89b233dfc8df60776962bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CadaCreate"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
