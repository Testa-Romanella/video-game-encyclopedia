In that war, the L'arc kingdom troops were led by General Cleon and had killed hundreds of people from the Sanpire tribe. Fyoodor Teo had lost his mother in the war, Teo's mother was a chief of the Sanpire tribe and he was the only family Teo owned. Deep sorrow creates a grudge in Teo's heart and he intends to avenge the death of his mother and all the people of the Sanpire tribe who died in the war.<br/>Happy news came from L'arc kingdom, there was a son of the king of Alexis Dominiq and a big party was held for the celebration and blessing of the son of Alexis. Eight years later, autumn arrived, right in the middle of the night when the hallowen celebrations of the L'arc kingdoms were at that time. When the entire army of the L'arc kingdoms was drunk and there was not a single guard guarding the L'arc kingdoms, Teo slipped into the kingdom wearing a black robe and headed for Alexis' room, Alroy Dominiq.<br/>\"Knock-knock, trick or treating\"<br/>(Teo breaks the door of the room then seduces Alroy and takes him to his hiding place and leaves a message in Alroy's room that says last power on a glass with ink from blood.)<br/>The next morning Alexis ordered Cleon to bring his son, Alroy, and to kill the kidnapper. There is an information said that Alroy was took by Fydoor Teo which on a mission of looking the power of magic, but there is one condition, that he must kill the king\u2019s son from the most powerful kingdom. L\u2019arc Kingdoms are one of the most powerful kingdoms in the world. Hearing that news, Alexis ordered his troops to immediately find his son so as not to be killed by Teo, a psychopath from the Sampire tribe.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The journey begins, Cleon heading to Smitty Graf Area and on his way there Cleon found an exit gate of the Smitty Graf Area. The gate can only open with a spell in the pieces of paper. While he is looking for the pieces of the spell, Cleon meets with Gustaf and they both fight over the last piece of paper of the spell to open the gate of Smitty Graf Area, the fight was very fierce but Cleon wins the fight and takes the last piece of the spell. After managed to open the gate, Cleon continues his way to the Pompeii village. As he arrives in the village, he looked for the whereabouts of blood, a swordsman who has two special magic-powered swords. In the middle of his search, he killed Esclave and took a number of his treasure, then Cleon asked to the man who manages the weapons shop and negotiated by giving away his loot for an information on Blood whereabouts. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The shopkeeper said that Blood is nowhere to be found in Pompeii, he lived in a village called Oscuridad. Cleon immediately heading to Oscuridad, a dark and quite place, and there\u2019s when he found blood. Cleon then attacks Blood, who is so agile in fighting and that make Cleon overwhelmed, but Cleon managed to beat him in the middle of the fight. Blood said if he (Cleon) wants to find Teo, he has to face Kronox first and Kronox can only be defeated with Blood\u2019s swords. Cleon continues his journey to 35 area, Kronox is a witch who has the power of power punch and Cleon has to feel several painful punches from Kronox, so that it makes Cleon weakened and he remembers the blood\u2019s words and then Cleon stabs Kronox\u2019s heart and succeed to kill him. Then, Cleon continues his journey through a forest. There are troops from Lucifer who camouflage as trees and attack Cleon in that forest. Cleon fights against Lucifer's troops with the agility and the ingenuity. He managed getting out of the forest and found a tunnel which was where Lucifer\u2019s stayed.<br/>Cleon began to enter into a very dark tunnel and suddenly met Lucifer and he gives a game to Cleon. \"If you can't beat me within 1.5 minutes then I'll tell you where Teo is.\u201d<br/>Finally Cleon fights Lucifer who has magic power that can bring his life back again. Cleon have to oppress the battle with Lucifer so that there is no time for Lucifer to return his life, and Cleon succeed to defeat Lucifer in time. Lucifer kept his promise and shows the way to the Vladius Monument and the whereabouts of the Drazic Flood before entering a Chantant Church which is Teo's hiding place.<br/>Cleon rushed to Vladius Monument. There lied a box and a container where he could find a magical leaf that could grant him the power he used to have. There was also an armour inside. Then Cleon arrived at the front yard of the church and Drazic Flood assaulted him immediately. He is Teo's sidekick. Cleon tried his best to beat Drazic, and the fight went on, both strong enough to beat each other. But then Cleon found Drazic's weak spot, his head. Cleon stabbed Drazic's head and that was all it takes for Drazic to crumble down. Cleon then got the keys and went into the church to find Teo sitting inside. He walked closer. Teo told Cleon what he had been planning all along. He told Cleon how his tribe's battle against L'arc was just a bait. The battle cost his mother's life. He sacrifice his mother so Sanpire Tribe would choose him as their new leader. They did. And Teo got Gustaf, Blood, Kronox, Lucifer, and Drazic Flood, who were the knights of the Sanpire Tribe, as his new troops.<br/>He was promised to gain a mortal power in one condition: he had to kill the most powerful prince of the kingdom. So without any hesitation, Cleon launched an attack at Teo, but it was dodged. Teo made a game; if Cleon could actually kill him, Alroy would get his freedom. That made Cleon gather all the strength he had left and pounced at Teo. The fight got more heated and fought as time went by. Teo wass practically immortal, he could heal his own soul back and pulled himself far from death. Then Cleon recalled the strategy he used against Lucifer; he stalled, preventing Teo from getting any time to heal his soul. It worked. And when Teo started to feel weak and lose all his strength, Cleon pricked his heart, thrusting deep into Teo's chest till he fell, lifeless. He ran to Alroy, setting him free and bringing him back home.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T05:20:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef9/ef9662924da50a22d120fa3dd84078ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Catalyst2018"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
