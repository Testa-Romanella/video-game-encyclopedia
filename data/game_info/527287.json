This is my First Game Jam!\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I WAY over scoped my idea for this game Jam and then on top of that I did not get to work on it nearly as much as I wanted to. Things just came up so please don't judge me to harshly :D<br/></p>\n<p>This \"Game\" is really more of a playable idea of something I didn't get time to finish. In this game you have a pack that allows you to manipulate gravity's pull in three ways.<br/></p>\n<p>1. it allows you to get boosted upward, kind of like a burst jet pack</p>\n<p>2. it allows you to shoot forwards with tons of speed.</p>\n<p>3. You can use it to slam you down and bust through obstacles</p>\n<p>You can do all three of these is this game and you'll go and explore this quickly put together world I made and collect dollars and quarters. I even made a collectable mask you can put on in the game cause pandemic lol.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is some hidden dudes in the level playing janky looking animations and three shrunk down dudes that are kind of hidden.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mouse and keyboard</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to move<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SPACE</strong> to jump<br/></p>\n<p><strong>G</strong> to switch \"Gravity\u00a0Abilities\"</p>\n<p><strong>SPACE </strong>while in air to use \"Gravity Abilities\"</p>\n<p>Press <strong>C While in air</strong> to use Gravity Smash</p>\n<p><strong>TAB </strong>to pause</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controller Controls</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>left thumb stick</strong> to move</p>\n<p><strong>A </strong>or\u00a0<strong>X</strong> to jump<br/></p>\n<p><strong>D-PAD Up </strong>to\u00a0switch \"Gravity\u00a0Abilities\"</p>\n<p><strong>A </strong>or <strong>X</strong> while in air to use \"Gravity\u00a0Abilities\"</p>\n<p><strong>Right Thumb\u00a0Stick Button</strong> while in air to use Gravity\u00a0Smash</p>\n<p><strong>Pause\u00a0Button</strong><em>?</em> To Pause\u00a0</p>\n<p>(May have forgotten to implement the controller pause key binding...)\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Pack your guy wears has Three lights to indicate how much \"Gravity\u00a0Ability\" you have left to use.</p>\n<p>The jump boost uses one per boost <strong>(Represented By a <em>Blue </em>Glow)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The Forward Speed Boost takes all three\u00a0<strong>(Represented By a <em>Purple </em>Glow)</strong></p>\n<p>The Gravity Slam used only two Points\u00a0<strong>(Represented By a <em>RED\u00a0</em></strong><strong>Glow)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Please enjoy, its not a whole lot just had some stuff come up with my work and family that just limited my time on this project, it was fun!</p>\n<p>ps.
