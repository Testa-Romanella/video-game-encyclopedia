This is in no way a well made game as I have little experience and missed the first\u00a0 day during the jam, however it\u00a0 seems bug free and somewhat fun so here ya go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How does this fit the theme? Well RTS are known for their deep strategy and to do so you must have direct control over your units. In this you can only pick which enemies to control for a certain period of time and you cannot order them around. There are workarounds to this though, for example pick the enemy with the most health or the one with the lowest when you the bar is small to quickly kill off someone without wasting to many resources.</p>\n<p>Also the \"graphics\" are bad, no music or SFX at all... yep this was rushed.</p>\n<p>My high score is\u00a011958</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/800/8003f68bac5388e169d40b73460641b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DodgyDoge"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
