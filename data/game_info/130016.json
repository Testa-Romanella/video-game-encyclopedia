You have two concerns in life: Collecting raindrops, and not dying.</p><p>Use the left and right arrow keys to move. Try to collect as many raindrops as possible. Don't get struck by lightning.</p><p>If the game crashes, you win!<br/></p><p>Part of the purpose of making this game was to gain experience in the Rust programming language; as such, it is more of a programming exercise than a complete game.</p><p>The package includes the source code and executables for Windows and Linux. To build the game, download Rust from rust-lang.org, then open a terminal and type cargo build.</p><p>I have attempted to provide a Linux build, however, you will need to go to a terminal and type: chmod +x lightning-dodge-x86_64  before it will run. Even then, graphics drivers are tricky and might refuse to let the game start. I'm sorry!<br/></p><p>The git repository is located at https://github.com/beholdnec/lightning-dodge .<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/736/736a396b10ddaea5602dc11ebe9ff17b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["beholdnec"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
