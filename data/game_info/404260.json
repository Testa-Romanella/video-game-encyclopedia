Decided to upload the game anyways.</p>\n<p>Controls is listed in game, via the controls tab. This game also supports a controller.</p>\n<p>This game\u00a0<em>does not</em> support saving your progress. I tried learning how, but we were pressed for time so I never added it. Perhaps if I get enough views/likes I'll add an update. We had a LOT of ideas.</p>\n<p>Note: if you select a level and click <strong>play</strong> and after a few seconds it goes back to the Main Menu, this is a bug that I've spent hours trying to find. It randomly appears\u00a0<em>unfrequently</em>. So just click play again and chances are the game will successfully load.</p>\n<p>There is a single cheat added, but I\u00a0<strong>highly</strong> don't suggest using it. If you insist on finding out what the cheat is:\u00a0The character O gives you 1000 coins.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T03:44:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bc/9bcd67e62cbce5a126af650952c5ee1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frustrated-Programmer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
