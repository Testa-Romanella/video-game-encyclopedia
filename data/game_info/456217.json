Players will control both a spacecraft and its crew as well as a landing party of stalwart discoverers brave enough to explore the utterly alien planets of an endless and mysterious universe. WIDE OPEN SPACE comprises two types of gameplay: spaceflight and planetary exploration. Spaceflight involves the operation of an interstellar vehicle as it plots and takes a course beyond the frontiers of the known universe. All players will participate jointly in this process. Players will then take on individual roles in planetary exploration as the spacecraft arrives at its destination and releases a landing party from cryo sleep: each player but one will create a personalized alien explorer to roleplay in a customized adventure of discovery and danger. The remaining player will take on the role of Creator, or game leader. This player will be the storyteller, providing obstacles, locations, and characters for the other players to interact with.</p>\n<p>WIDE OPEN SPACE is an entirely original\u00a0rules-light tabletop roleplaying system with a formatted 11-page manual and two tracking sheets. Besides the manual, those two sheets, and a boundless imagination, a player will also need four-, six-, and twelve-sided dice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:46:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b0/2b014e2cd43bd489975142fc499171a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A S Ember"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
