It's based in 2020 Unity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The \"Farren\" is a shifted or warped reality of our own. It is the place that holds our karma and energy we leave behind with our actions. It lies just beneath the seams, and when the energy becomes too much, it can bulge and tear openings into our world. Spirits of this world can be created, and depending on the energy on which it rises, dictates whether the being is malevolent or benevolent. The type of person you are, can attract the attention of these good or evil creatures...</p>\n<p>In the game, you are a random civilian driving to the corner store to grab a few things like milk or a snack. After grabbing all of the things on your list, the doorway out of the store becomes a void, the woman at the counter is gone, and all the lights just broke...
