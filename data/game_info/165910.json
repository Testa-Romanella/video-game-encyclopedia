Knowing her, it's probably not the first time, but this time, she runs into a collection of tents and hides in a small one. She's soon caught by a cat-boy and a gorgeous man with white hair, who inform her she's in a circus tent. While she ultimately convinces them to let her hide out with them until they leave that place and travel to their next location, neither of them seem to like her much. Can she hope to change that and maybe even truly become a part of the circus?</p><p>CGs by the amazing C.S.R., whose art blog you can find here : \u00a0theartofcsr.tumblr.com</p><p>Credit to minyan for the sprite generator (I used them as a base and modified them generously) for Phoenix, Raphael, and Ziya.
