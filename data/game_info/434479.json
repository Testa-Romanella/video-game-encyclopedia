Take up the role of an antibody armed with a syringe launcher to protect the heart from invading viruses. Use the enemy health drops to heal the bleeding heart and see just how long you can survive.</p>\n<p>\"Medically Inaccurate\" is a 3D top-down shooter made in Unity. Here are the instructions and controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move<br/>Mouse - Aim<br/>Left Mouse - Shoot<br/>Right Mouse - Heal the Heart<br/>Esc - Open Pause Menu</p>\n<p>- Keep the heart alive and beating for as long as possible by protecting it from the invading viruses.<br/>- Walk near health drops to pick them up. Heal the heart with Right Click; this transfers some of your health to it.<br/>- The top bar represents the heart's health, and the bottom bar represents your health.</p>\n<p>There are four types of enemies:</p>\n<p>- Blue is a normal enemy.<br/>- Red is a faster moving enemy but has less health.<br/>- Green is a brute and has more health, but moves slower.<br/>- Black is a boss, has the most health, and shoots virus projectiles at its target.</p>\n<p>All sound effects and music were not made by us (unfortunately we did not have enough time), and here are the credits for those:</p>\n<p>- Ultimate Game Music Collection by John Leonard French (Unity Asset Store)<br/>- Universal Sound FX by Imphenzia (Unity Asset Store)<br/>- http://soundbible.com/1766-Fire-Pager.html</p>\n<p>And thanks to Illumin8 for the font!<br/></p>\n<p>Please feel free to post your highest score and time in the comments and thank you for playing!
