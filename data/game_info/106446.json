You must explore the city to stay awake and find conversations and distractions to pass time, or places to catch small naps. There is risk in everything you do.<br/><br/>-Meet a dog.<br/>-Talk to people.<br/>-Be crushed under the weight of your own depression.<br/>-Sleep on the ground.<br/><br/><em>12hrs </em>is an in-development game for Little Bytes and seeks constructive criticism and feedback at kivabay (at) gmail (dot) com.<br/><br/>Things to look forward to: <br/>Things that happened:<br/><br/>-More dog!<br/>-More exhaustion!<br/>-More spange!<br/>-Maybe food?<br/><br/>Now please enjoy a brand new \"beg for spare change\" mechanic written by my wonderful friend and programmer, Caelyn. Enjoy the humiliation of paying for things in change that you begged for on the street outside.<br/><br/>Wanna buy the soundtrack? It's by Maddy Myers. She included it in the awesome resource Asset Basket which is where I found it.<br/><br/>Interested in checking out more of Caelyn Sandel's code? Her website is an excellent place to start.<br/><br/><strong>Oh right, do you like <em>12hrs</em></strong><strong> and would like to give money for it? Consider putting that money towards a charity.
