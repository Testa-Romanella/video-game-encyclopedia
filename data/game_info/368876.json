The player chooses a weapon type to equip, then chooses from all of the available starter weapons to grab whichever mod they want to add. Hit Confirm and the player now has a weapon they like with the mods they want. The hope for a full game would be to allow players to invest in the weapons they want to the point that the weapon can start to feel personal to them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T06:29:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/996/9962a89d0acf52bc8c730aee53c1ecee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Feornic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
