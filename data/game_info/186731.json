It helps if you think of it as an action puzzle game in the vein of Nintendo's Puzzle League series and SNK's Magical Drop III. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Current safety regulations state that I have to remind you that you can move back and forth with either the arrow keys or the gamepad.\u00a0 You can pick up and stack plates with the space bar or the A button.\u00a0 Since we don't want you to get bored during those small breathers, you can press B (gamepad or keyboard) to advance the belt. You can also press escape/start to pause and have the option to quit (your severance will be forfeit, of course.) <br/></p>\n<p>There's no pressure, just keep your brain clear and your fingers loose, or you're fired.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b513536a19e36658a1bf6e7c46908769.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jryvn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
