{"id": 784011, "slug": "kyma-lone-shores-2", "name": "Kyma | Lone Shores", "name_original": "Kyma | Lone Shores", "description": "<p>\"KYMA | lone shores\" is a university student project which\u00a0combines aspects of an open world exploration game with a multisensory experience. The player is set in isolation on an island - time stands still and nothing appears as it seems. While unraveling the mysteries and secrets of the island in hopes of escape the player is faced with allied and opposing forces originating from a hidden world only experienceable by sound. To aid the player in their quest they are equipped with the ability of sending out sound waves revealing the second world. Mystical artefacts are spread throughout the island, which the player has to find. On activation the otherwise invisible world is uncovered and time is shifted, gradually itching forward towards the rescue.<br/></p>\n<p>Reference points for the game are colour schemes by Paul Klee and Kandinsky such as his synesthesia.. Furthermore we introduced the 3 basic Bauhaus shapes in a 3-dimensional world [square-cube-collectable, circle-sphere-enemy follower, triangle-tetraeder-static enemy].\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Lucas H\u00fcbner - 3D Art | Programming\r\n</p>\n<p>Juro Carl Anton Reinhardt - Sound Design | Level Design\r\n</p>\n<p>Leon-Etienne K\u00fchr - Visual Programming | Environment Art\r\n</p>\n<p>Phil Hagen Jungschlaeger - AI Programming |\u00a0Level Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T08:28:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/634/63435d96277c56c95cacd8a279ee56b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["32BitsAndPieces"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
