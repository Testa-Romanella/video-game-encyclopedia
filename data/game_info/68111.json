This game can be deceivingly simple but the challenge is great!<br/><br/>You can challenge the jungle in SINGLE mode:<br/>You will need to beat twelve animals in twelve different levels. You will begin with simple cards and few simple constraining rules, but as you progress, the difficulty increases and only the fastest warrior will become king of the Jungle. Check the game center and challenge the current king.<br/><br/>You can also challenge a friend in DUAL mode:<br/>Each opponent will swipe a cards, when you see matching symbols tap faster than your friends, or you\u2019ll be stuck with the pile of discarded cards. Only the strongest will survive the Jungle.<br/><br/>Be on the watch for special colored arrows cards that match any symbols, The challenge starts by matching symbols but as you progress, colors, fog, rain, thunders and earthquakes will come into play to make the jungle more challenging.<br/><br/>Speedy Jungle is on one end, fast paced and easy to learn, but on the other it can be quite demanding on your warrior instinct, reflexes and concentration.
