Currently, the game only supports endless mode where the goal is to try to survive as long as possible before your base gets destroyed. Face off against goblins, witches, wolfs,\u00a0orcs, and ogres, which all have different strengths and weaknesses\u00a0while managing your resources in real-time.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to Stick Wars, a game about a 2D battle simulator\u00a0using real-time strategy\u00a0with a variety of troops. In this game, you can use enemy corpses to do three things:\u00a0spawn a skeleton of the same enemy type or summon a minion that can mine bones from graves, or summon more graves for the minions to mine. Bones can be used for upgrading a specific skeleton's attack, defense multiple times, or upgrading your max troop size (which includes both skeletons, and minions).</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0Three Button Jam [8 Bits To Infinity}, which had the theme, of cycles.
