It\u2019s man versus beast versus man versus man. And if you\u2019re no stranger to danger, come play as a ranger fighting off armies of ruthless poachers with nothing but your wits, harsh language, braai tongs and an arsenal of weapons that would make any arms dealer green with envy. You wake up in your camp, make breakfast, get your orders and shoot poachers on sight using high powered automatic weapons. Simple. Or you skip breakfast, that\u2019s up to you. Or you chase chickens around for half an hour, grow hallucinogenic plants in the shed, spend the day barbequing goat chops to perfection, race ostriches or rescue lost rangers stuck in trees, I\u2019m not going to tell you how to live your life. You play it your way.

The games development is fully self funded and I encourage players to rather not buy the game until it's out of early access unless they want to be involved in the development process and instead download the free demo while waiting for the finished game! The demo itself will be regularly updated as the main game branch is updated for free forever.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game already currently has a great community behind it with over 100+ Private Beta testers that have helped steer development since the projects inception in 2020.
