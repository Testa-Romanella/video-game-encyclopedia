I did get the on steam for $19.99 and didn't steal from the internet. Do not\u00a0pirate games please plus it's illgeal. This is to save a older verison for the future to enjoy. This is not a virus and that firewall blocked thing is just happening because some steamworks files were removed to help make the game playable without steam causing problem with that. For the 101% save, you can use it on the offical steam release too. The steam verisons that don't say playtest a have v1 or v2 or even v2.1 are not modded other than the verison number. Make sure to fully exit out steam if your controls are bug and not working correctly on controller.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Links</p>\n\n<p>The download link for the content:https://archive.org/download/pizza-tower-v-1.0.193-a-save-with-all-levels-finish...</p>\n<p>For older builds before steam,go to this guys page for that stuff: https://archive.org/details/pizzatowerdemobuildspublic\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the steam achievement manager is here: https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager/releases/tag/7.0.25\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steam link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:34:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be2/be2865f58d561e2e61f8466be27a65ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mario_Kid_64"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
