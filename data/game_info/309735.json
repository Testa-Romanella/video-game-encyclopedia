There is Dolly, a sheep that grows like a wolf. Having an identity shift, they&#39;re taking it out on themselves with physical abuse. <br />\nDub, a turtle that won&#39;t ever stop exercising.  Kroko, a crocodile that hides behind a pillow that it uses as a fetish.  Lilo, a hippo that can&#39;t work out the simplest of problems. <br />\nAnd Sly, a snake that seems to be suffering from depersonalization. </p>\n<p>An additional character was added after release.  Dr Wood is a sort of crow-like creature that visists all of the patients and writes notes. As of yet, he&#39;s not interactive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-17T23:03:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/df9/df93bf7cd2a8511f9a4033d4b5b5c72f.jpg", "website": "http://www.parapluesch.de/whiskystore/test.htm", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
