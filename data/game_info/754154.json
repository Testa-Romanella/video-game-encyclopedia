I have planned and started so many games in the past, but I always lost interest before I could finish them. So, I did kind of rush this one--It was made in 2 days. I'm sure it shows in the product. But I really wanted to finish it and I knew that if I took any longer with it I would have lost interest and I had already told my girlfriend that I was making it and I don't want to be like \"Hey I'm mkaing this game\" \"Ok\" and then \"Nevermind\" after less than a week as has happened multiple times before...</p>\n<p>Yes there will most likely be issues so if you find issues please tell me so that I may fix them thank You so mucvh.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T14:27:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8c/b8c8d05a5cc560126183cdcee01dc870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spades"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
