Whatever the reason maybe, folks love to travel to hilly areas and stay away from the flakiness and noise of the city scape. Mountains never cease to surprise you with awe-inspiring beauty and a close to nature experience but they are also full of treacherous paths and windy roads. The snow doesn't help either. It leaves cracks in the path and then there is land sliding.<br/><br/>Just like us our cars also become complacent. They like to be driven on shiny &amp; smooth roads of the city. Finding gas stations is a breeze and unless you think you are on an F1 track the brakes serve you well in the metro traffic. Remember the time when you were short of breath after walking up a mile in the mountains? Why should our cars be any different. Breakdowns are inevitable and people who have come up all the way to enjoy are worried sick about their vehicles.<br/><br/>That's your cue - Come in and drive emergency and relief vehicles to tow away the cars that have broken down. We need to keep the path clear to make sure people can come up and down easily. So let's gear up that bad boy and help people out.<br/><br/>Please share your feedback about the game. We'd like to improve and your feedback is the only thing that matters.
