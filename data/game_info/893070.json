But during Graduation, something happened. You lost control of your body and watched as you killed your friends and hurt several people. When you got control again you woke up in jail. Sentence for ten years. No one listened or cared what you said after all killing the United States President's kid was what everyone cared about. What makes it worse you don't remember the 10 years and your abilities are gone.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Now the only thing left to do is to try and rebuild the life that was taken from you. Noah the man who raised you gave you a choice. It was the only choice you had. To become an Instructor for the White Hawks teaching young Heroes. He also gave you a small team to be in charge of three students no one can seem to get along with or lead. With you in charge of a team, you can get answers. Can you show these three students what it means to be a hero, or will you lead them to a darker path? Will you get answers for what happened to you?\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<strong><em>Features</em></strong>\n<ul><li>Choose your MC Gender and Pronouns\r\n</li><li>Choose Your Alias so everyone knows you\r\n</li><li>Choose your Mask and Outfit\r\n</li><li>Learn a dark secret that heroes and villains have kept\r\n</li><li>Romance Heroes and Villains\r\n</li><li>Get answers to what happened to your MC\r\n</li><li>Prevent an Intergalactic misunderstanding or make it worse\r\n</li><li>Do you burn everything you once believed in or change the way a hero should be?\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong><em>Romance Options</em></strong>\n<p><strong><em>Alice Walker- F- (RO)Alias- White Death</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Age - 32</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Height - 6ft 1</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0You know her, hell everyone knows her as for she is the Villain who defected the original 12.
