You need to use your special skill to escape - <strong>become a ball</strong> that can bounce on walls. Crush enemies, collect balls, upgrade your skills and free Ball Knight!</p>\n<p>This is a short (subjective) arcade game. Took way too long to make XD<br/></p>\n<p>All Music in-game by:</p>\n<p><strong>Matthew Huffaker<br/></strong></p>\n<p>www.teknoaxe.com</p>\n<p>www.youtube.com/user/teknoaxe<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>When the timer is counting down, mash the spacebar as fast as possible. Use <strong> Spacebar or Left Mouse </strong>to bounce.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:<br/></strong>Time your bounces right after you hit the wall. Helps maximize your boost! Upgrade the balls received as early as possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T04:17:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec6/ec648cd31b5305257c0b176b195e341f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["wolfmakesgames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
