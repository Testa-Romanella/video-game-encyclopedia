The nature of this game is a regular clicker. The point of the game is to generate ki, and transform that ki into more fighting power. You can use ki to train under different schedules.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do not own the characters, and the character designs and name belong to their respective company. The code and game design belong to me.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you like the game, and have a great time. The game is rather complete and do not expect to give any further updates, but I will probably release a phone version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T07:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fed/fedf3aaaf5864113aea3e344fe9e7730.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iKnoware Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
