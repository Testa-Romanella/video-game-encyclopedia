When they run out of power they become weak and can be defeated by the enemy easier. The player\u2019s star power is constantly draining.</p>\n<p>I did all art &amp; programming &amp; Sound effects in the jam version. I also don\u2019t do programming too often, I mostly do the art side of things \u2026 despite this I gave solo ludumdare jam a shot anyways\u00a0!\u00a0</p>\n<p>hope you enjoy~<br/></p>\n\r\nCONTROLS:\r\nW,A,S,D :\r\n<p>Move Player Character</p>\r\nCursor:\r\n<p>Your units follow the cursor.
