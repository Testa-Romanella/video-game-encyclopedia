{"id": 717094, "slug": "master-of-the-wind-fan-remake", "name": "Master of the Wind Fan Remake", "name_original": "Master of the Wind Fan Remake", "description": "<p>This is a fangame remaking the opening dungeon of the indie RPG series \"Master of the Wind\" (by Volrath and Artbane of Solest Games).</p>\n<p>The story takes place in the fantasy world of Solest and begins by following two individuals who take on masked personas to fight crime. \u00c7ade Mistral, a human wind mage who goes by the hero name \"Shroud,\" and Bones, a duel-wielding skeleton who goes by the name \"Stoic.\" Together they protect their home town Port Arianna from evil-doers. One of their frequent enemies is a vampire named Andau, who runs around preying upon the blood of innocent girls.\r\n</p>\n<p>This fan-remake covers the opening section of Arc I, in which Shroud and Stoic chase Andau into an abandoned fort and try to defeat and capture him.\r\n</p>\n<p>The original game series was made in RPG Maker XP and featured turn-based combat and classic top-down 2D movement and dungeon-design. The opening has been remade into a fully-3D game in Unreal Engine 4. The combat takes elements from the original game and transforms it into a real-time action combat system more similar to modern RPGs.</p>\n<p>While the game can be played with a mouse and keyboard, it is <strong>highly</strong> recommended that you play with a controller if you have one as that is what the game was primarily designed around. You can change the UI to match the control-type (Playstation, Xbox, or Mouse and Keyboard) in the \"Options\" menu.\r\n</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>Estimated Playtime Length: 15-30 minutes\r\n</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>Voice Cast:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Shroud:</strong> Chris (LoststeamVAA)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Stoic:</strong> William Chan (Biru)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Andau:\u00a0</strong>Andr\u00e9 Persson (VActorDreamer)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Fairy:</strong> Kelly Peterson (Kowabungakelly)\r\n</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>#rpg #fangame #action</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T02:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/802/8025917b5e6173123572d81b1f163f45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["C4DNerd"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
