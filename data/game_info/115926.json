Want a JRPG the way they used to make them, with pixels and sprites and moving melodies? Want familiar yet fresh classes, combat, and customizable character progression? Want a rich, original story that plays with classic tropes and then sinks deep into them?<br/></p>\n<p><em>Voiceless</em> is that game, a classic JRPG---with a stealth-based twist.</p>\n<p>Echoing the very first Final Fantasy, you\u2019ll choose your party of four out of six potential classes (any combination will work!) and...then find that, like chess pieces, they don\u2019t say much. Foxe, a fast-mouthed, self-proclaimed master thief, hires this band of silent protagonists for a mission to uncover the mystery behind the return of Prince Josiel, whom Foxe claims is a fraud.
