There isn't much to do:</p><ul><li>Move around with the analog stick.</li><li>Pan the camera left and right with the triggers.</li><li>Shoot with the A button.</li></ul><p>The objective we had with this game was checking how complicated the Dreamcast is to develop, along with creating a small framework to keep working over it.</p><p>And it was <strong>incredible. </strong>The Dreamcast is as close as it can get to a PC of the time, the KallistiOS toolchain works very, very nice and interfacing with modern production tools such as modern Blender or Gimp is easy. It was so much fun to work on and watching the game run on the real console was epic.</p><p>We will keep doing Dreamcast development so stay tuned!</p><p><strong>Source code</strong></p><p>The full source for the game is on the following Github repository. It is barely documented and is missing our asset pipeline tools, but I hope it is useful for other people wanting to get into Dreamcast development:</p><p>https://github.com/cegonse/dcjam2016</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cf/0cf81ccc6a5dd08b5fb6eda99226271d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jumble!
