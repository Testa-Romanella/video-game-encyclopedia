The new object is a water bottle modeled after the hydroflask I own in real life (with the art work simplified). When drawing the water bottle, you can hit the spacebar key and it will animation the bottle. The animation just spins the water bottle on its y axis, allowing you to see it from all sides.\r\n      </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:03:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85f/85fe9c60aefdd05a78761985f71cbc13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["waqaspathan00"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
