The enemies are crafty, and constantly shift their attacking fleets and routes. Scan the waves to discover the enemy's plan of attack and move your ships into position!\u00a0 Be wary, enemies are tough and your fleet is small. Scavenge for resources between waves to upgrade your ships. Hold out until reinforcements arrive. Good luck Commodore!</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dylan McCarroll <br/>Technical Designer / Manager</p>\n<p>Dylan Marx<br/>3D Artist / Playtester / VFX / Designer</p>\n<p>Remy Streichenberger\u00a0<br/>Designer / UI / Audio</p>\n<p>Shangyang Min<br/>Programer / Playtester / Designer</p>\n\n<p>Made for MI 445 Team Project at Michigan State University <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:40:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94e/94eac4597dc4fc9be898ff4231789dfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Remy Streichenberger"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
