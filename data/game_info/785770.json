I wanted my own list that involved less ridiculous RNG tasks - like getting an enchanted golden apple - and instead focused on more skill-based/gathering tasks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Gamemodes:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Bingo: Share a copy of the board via screenshot or png with the person you want to play with. First to complete a row, column, or diagonal wins!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Lockout: Share a copy of the board via screenshot or png with the person you want to play with. When one person completes a task, that task is locked away for the other player. First to complete 13 tasks wins!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0100% Speedrun: Share a copy of the board via screenshot or png with the person you want to play with. First to complete the entire board wins!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Rules:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0- Items: If the goal has an item name (Ex. 4 enderpearls) you must have all the required items in your inventory at one point. Afterwards, you are free to do what you want with them</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0- Actions: If the goal asks you to perform an action (Ex. Kill an Iron Golem) the goal is completed once you perform the action.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0- Builds: If the goal asks you to build a structure (Ex. 3x3x2 stone) the goal is completed once you complete the build. The build must remain standing the last time you see it. If it gets destroyed during the Bingo within your line of sight then the task is not counted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T20:21:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a86ed60d6b66269cbb6d283870ad73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["congrets"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
