I had the objective of making a flying game, but when I tested some free-flying game mechanics, I felt some motion sickness! So, rather than making a game where the player can freely fly and turn and spin, I chose to pursue a game where the player is constantly advancing forward. This makes Rocketboarder, in some strange way, <strong>a VR descendant of classic space shooters</strong>.<br/><br/>Steer the board with your body <br/>To play Rocketboarder, you plant your feet in a wide stance and calibrate the center of your head. Lean left and the board drifts left, lean right and the board drifts right. Crouch downward and your board swoops down; stand up with your hands to the sky to fly upward.Body Avatar even with no Trackers<br/>Since the player is supposed to play with their feet planted, the in-game foot location combined with the tracked location of the head and controllers can be used to position a virtual avatar. It's not perfect but it should give a cool effect! (Turn the body on in the Game Options menu) <br/><br/>Despite not requiring body-trackers for body presence, <strong>you CAN use 2 or 3 Vive Trackers to enhance the body tracking</strong>.DIY Motion Rig if you dare?Have you ever wanted to have your own motion rig? Do you have a Vive Tracker that you don't know what to do with? Make yourself a DIY balance board to control the game! But you absolutely should have a friend there to catch you if you try that! (Note that this might not work simultaneously with the body trackers) More info soon.Builds upon work done for The Path of Greatest ResistanceThis game also builds upon work done for The Path of Greatest Resistance. I used a lot of the same assets etc. Please keep in mind that, besides the engine, assets, plugins etc, this game is primarily the work of myself and my father, and it usually hasn't been a full-time project! There's only 1 intro tutorial mission and 4 missions that are right now based on the same procedural template level.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that this isn't a full-priced game and I hope people can enjoy it for what it is!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f9/0f9352dea2d98e9ec2a4a5e49a8637e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 527, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RealityRig"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["RealityRig"], "esrb_rating": null}
