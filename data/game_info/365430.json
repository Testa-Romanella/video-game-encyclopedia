The limitation that makes this game jam interesting is a 64x64 pixel max resolution!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In all modes, WASD are used to control movement of your bee. In Versus and Free mode, use Left Mouse Click to fire your equipped weapon. In\u00a0Versus mode you can only carry one weapon at a time. Use your mouse to aim your shots. Press ESCAPE in any mode to return to the title screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>VERSUS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In Versus mode, you control a lone drone on a mission to collect as many flowers as possible. Unfortunately, an enemy hive has sent a drone of their own to crash your pollen party. Collect as many flowers as possible and use a variety of power-ups to give yourself an edge:</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>CROWNS\u00a0</strong>give you a momentary speed boost<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>MAGNETS</strong> are great for drawing bunches of flowers to your position<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>SMOKE GRENADES\u00a0</strong>are great for calming enemy bees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>STINGER MISSILES\u00a0</strong>are something to respect. When they strike a bee they permanently destroy a number of collected flowers and can turn the tide of a runaway match.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>TIME</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Timed mode is a fun but challenging alternative to Versus. Compete against the clock to collect 8 flowers spread out over the play area.</p>\n<p><strong>FREE</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Free mode is a cathartic time-waster where you're given unlimited <strong>stinger missiles</strong> and a hive begging to be destroyed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>ATTRIBUTIONS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A very special thanks to my dedicated QA team who helped squash many bees bugs - Steve, Phil, and Chris, you guys rock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And thanks to the royalty free music producers!</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Kalte Ohren ( Remix )</strong> by<em> Dysfunction_AL</em> (c) copyright 2019 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/destinazione_altrove/59536 Ft: Starfrosch, Kara Square -- featured as the main menu music</li><li><strong>Follow Me Short Edit</strong> - PlayOnLoop -- featured as the Time mode music</li><li><strong>I dunno</strong> by <em>grapes</em> (c) copyright 2008 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626 Ft: J Lang, Morusque -- featured as the\u00a0Versus mode music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T07:12:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48cd1030b5105dbcfb4eb7c1a7e7f8d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CastleSeven"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
