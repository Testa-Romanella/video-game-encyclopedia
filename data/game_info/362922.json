Goliath is a giant who is controlled by the movement of the VR player. David, the dwarf, is controlled with a gamepad like in any usual jump &amp; run game. Goliath can help David to cross abysses or reach higher platforms by offering his body as a bridge. David is highly vulnerable to fire, spikes and other dangers so Goliath must protect David.
