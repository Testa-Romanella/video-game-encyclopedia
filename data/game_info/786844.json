It is based on a previous kart racing game I made which I felt could've been much better than it came out to be in the end, so I'm treating it as the prototype for this new project! I'm making this project public and free for people to play as I'm aiming to grow a community for it and get feedback, however when the game is officially finished and released it will have a price.</p>\n<p>Feel free to try it out and give your opinions on what's currently in the game! Note that Project Drift Crystal is of course a temporary name for the game until I decide on a final one in later development.<br/></p><p>CONTROLS</p><p>Keyboard:</p><p>Driving/Steering - Arrow Keys</p><p>Drift - Space</p><p>Look Behind - A</p><p>Gamepad:</p><p>Driving/Steering - Left Joystick</p><p>Drift - Right Bumper<br/></p><p>Look Behind - Left Bumper</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:43:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/900/900b14d620238ff19f85ff3c594ea638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vanetavi"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
