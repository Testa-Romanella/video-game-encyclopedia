{"id": 932604, "slug": "puzzle-collection-itch", "name": "Puzzle Collection (itch)", "name_original": "Puzzle Collection (itch)", "description": "<p>This is a short RPG Maker VX Ace project. It shows several different types of puzzles that can be made using the built-in event system of RPG Maker.</p>\n<p>I will remake the eventing of this game on my YouTube channel (scheduled completion date: April 9th)\u00a0and encourage people to use and modify my work for whatever purpose they see fit. The tutorials are provided for free, and I do not need to be credited in any way by people choosing to make use of them.</p>\n<p>Puzzle types demonstrated in this project:</p>\n<p>1. A bridge-crossing puzzle. Each bridge can only be crossed once. All bridges must be crossed in the same trip to solve the puzzle.</p>\n<p>2. A crate-pushing puzzle. This is the classic obstacle pushing you've probably seen everywhere already.</p>\n<p>3. A tile-sliding puzzle. An image is broken into pieces, with one piece of the puzzle missing. Pieces adjacent to the hole can be slid into it. The puzzle is complete once the provided pieces have been put into the correct places.</p>\n<p>4. 31 game. This is a demonstration of the combat system being used for a puzzle. Two people take turns counting 1, 2, or 3 numbers. The player who says \"31\" loses the game.</p>\n<p>5. A painting-restoration puzzle. The player is provided with a blank canvas and a finished image. By pasting a shape onto the canvas repeatedly, the player must recreate the finished image.</p>\n<p>6. An orb maze. The player picks up and drops orbs of various colours with both dark and light variants of the orbs. To walk through a door the player needs to be holding the orb of matching colour and darkness. However, while holding both the light and dark orb of the same colour, no doors of that colour can be traversed.</p>\n<p>7. A number-guessing puzzle. Guess a number within a certain number of tries. Each failed guess informs the player if they were too high or too low.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T18:34:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/597c9641b9ff693ed4eb419d7240f43b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mauvebutterfly"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
