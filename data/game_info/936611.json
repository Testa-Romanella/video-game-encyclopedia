Inspired by other wagering trick-takers like <em>Truc</em>, <em>The Garden</em> uses only 18 cards, and can be played with a subset of a regular playing card deck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lowest card wins a trick in<em> The Garden</em>,\u00a0\u00a0and the card that wins is counted for your score. However some cards are worth negative values, so can win a hand but lower your score for a round. Offer wagers to the other opponent in between tricks to raise the value of the round, or try to bluff them into an easy victory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No print and play files are provided, the rules indicate which cards from a playing card deck should be used.
