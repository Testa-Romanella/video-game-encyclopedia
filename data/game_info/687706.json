Throughout its runtime, there were several members who joined and left, as well as many collaborations with people outside the team.\u00a0The credits should be contained in the games themselves.</p>\n<p>Even though most of the games were made for jams, there were some larger projects that we took on (measured by development time), including\u00a0<em>Thermal Youngsters</em>, <em>Space Funeral 6</em>,\u00a0<em>Inferno</em>, <em>MANIC</em>, and the incomplete <em>Underwater Game</em>. Furthermore, there are three games (<em>Upsurge</em>, <em>Depurate</em>, and <em>Globin</em>)\u00a0that are under the name of\u00a0<em>Low Games</em>, which are each relatively substantial.</p>\n<p>We also ran a tri-yearly game jam, naturally titled <em>Geta Game Jam</em>, which had a lot of great submissions. Definitely check those out!</p>\n<p>Alright, I hope you enjoy!!\u00a0\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc7d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97d/97d2337c84cf60a95746572fd8ec8bb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harry White Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
