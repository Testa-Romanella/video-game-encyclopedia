Homework..?\u00a0</strong>These are things that you may experience at the Clearmirror Academy, a university for young minds to learn the noble arts of the arcane!</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<strong><em>Clearmirror Academy</em></strong>, you are the new student and depending on who you socialize with, the story will unfold in unique ways.</p>\n<p>Will you create a geeky tabletop roleplaying squad, or will you have a clique consisting of the most fashionable students? Or maybe you feel like you're better off alone?</p>\n<em>What to expect in this version..</em>\n<p>Since this is an early (alpha/prototype) version of the game, it will not contain everything that was originally planned or mentioned in documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>In this download you will be able to play through a very short, branching story where you meet one character and you're able to explore a first encounter which will include two minigames, with twelve mildly different endings.</strong></p>\n<p>I think it's important to realize that it is not a full version at all, and would possibly look and feel vastly different in a further developed version, especially the currently implemented minigames.</p>\n<em>Credits..</em>\n<p>The character art for <em>Juniper </em>and <em>Angelika</em>\u00a0provided by <strong>Embla Sunniva Brox </strong>(Instagram).</p><p>Using Fungus from\u00a0http://fungusgames.com/</p>\n<p><em>\"Labyrinth Dreams\" by Julie Maxwell's Piano Music is licensed under CC BY-ND 4.0<br/>\"Fish in the Pond\" by Julie Maxwell's Piano Music is licensed under CC BY-ND 4.0<br/>\u00a0\"Gustov Holst: Thaxted\" by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br/>\"Divertissement\" by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br/>\"Page Turn\" by Mydo1 is licensed under CC 0<br/>\"Page Turn 24\" by Koops is licensed under CC BY 3.0</em></p>\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have issues with the downloads or the games.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T04:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b9/3b95f285ab06366c56c4d8f5b130d675.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Edo/Laz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
