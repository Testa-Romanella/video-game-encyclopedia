Interact with things by walking over them with the arrow keys to prevent boredom from setting in.<br/>Certain items in the house\u00a0boost\u00a0 your fun levels, other items do nothing. If you wait long enough without succumbing to boredom you win.<br/>Also stay away from the walls. I don't know how to fix getting stuck in them.<br/><br/><strong>Note from the creator:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Play testing this was a pain since I had to play it through a couple times and I made it to be a cute thing you only play once for maybe a chuckle or two. The music is wonderful for such a little game\u00a0and big thanks to Luis\u00a0Say\u00e1n\u00a0 for creating the charming little song for me. I hope the people who play this game enjoy it or at least get a laugh. Thanks so much for reading this and playing my game, bye.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T02:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45fd6df5f8375745a47ec8c6a74f0222.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nerb-Princess"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
