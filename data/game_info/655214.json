Initial idea was to create a demake of the pseudo-3D stages in  Ecco: Tides of Time.</p><p>Controls: Use D-Pad to swim, A button for boost and C button to pause or exit to main menu. The circle around you indicates how much boost you have left. It recharges each time you rise to the surface. <br/></p><p>There are two game modes: time trial and endless runner. In endless runner you get a point for every ring you go through. There is a red vertical line that follows you and destroys rings as it passes them. You can miss three rings before the run ends.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ea/6eae8be38787b13d592159fc3d23d31e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jpfli"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
