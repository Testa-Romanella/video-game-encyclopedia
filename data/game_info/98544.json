Killing an opponent with it will cause them to EXPLODE in your color, splattering the walls and netting tons of points!</p>\n<p>By the end of the 3-minute round, whoever has the most of the arena splattered in his or her color is the winner. So show no mercy, pick your color, and lay waste to everyone before they get the chance to do the same to you!</p>\n<p>This game supports 2-4 players with Xbox/Xbone controllers. Check the READ ME for controls.</p>\n<p>Happy Splattering!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b7d22116ffa273e000122adf6a743d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jared Slawski"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
