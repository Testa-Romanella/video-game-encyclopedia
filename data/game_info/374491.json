Knowing that the government would come for him one day The gardener has carefully selected plants to produce the most deadly seeds.   Help him protect his forest against the soldiers !!</p>\n\n<p>Use SPACE + ARROWS to move and plant seeds.<br/></p>\n<p>Badam seeds will blow surrounding soldiers when mature. Once done they will regrow.<br/></p>\n<p>Be careful you have a limited amount of seeds and I didn't have time to show the amount of seed. If soldiers kill a plant but the plant is near another one pollinating occurs and new seeds are produced.</p>\n\n<p>If three soldiers make it through or kill the Gardener you lose.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing I had good times making it without even knowing a graphic tool or a game engine (100% using documentation and examples)</p>\n\n<p>Graphics: Minim</p>\n<p>Code: Minim</p>\n<p>Sound: OpenGameArt.org</p>\n<p>Music:<br/></p>\n\n<p>Exotic Battle Kevin MacLeod<br/></p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T08:39:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/eba8a90ac7f320d6dfffdbb313c7fcd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mini-m"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
