Find out in this game of puzzling strategies, limited resources, overpowered combos, hand-drawn pixel graphics, and endless chaos, where you either become the hero, or simply Cannot Adventure.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>1. Move with WASD.<br/>... ...You really thought you have control over that?</p>\n<p>1. Given six cards from a deck of plenty more, each representing an action of either movement, attack, or a combination of both, choose your next move wisely, as for every step you take, the enemies will advance as well.<br/>2. Eliminate all adversaries to move on to the next floor, where stronger foes, larger hordes, and greater rewards await.<br/>3. Between every floor, you are given two cards, with increasing probability to be rarer and more powerful, as a reward. Play a card in your hand as a sacrifice to welcome the new blood into your arsenal.<br/>4. Some cards, although powerful, will discard themselves after a timer. There are even some that will bring down their neighbors with them.</p>\n\n\n<p>Credit goes to:<br/>Slay the Spire, Hearthstone, Crypt of the Necrodancer, and many other games for inspiring the gameplay;<br/>Vurmux and their Urizen Onebit Tilesets for pixel art assets;<br/>Shadydave, levelplane, okieactor, Abyssmal, and Deathscyp on FreeSounds for music and sound FX assets;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:50:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/199/199ea90c2d3c38c27169f2d1129bac8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["matthew9671", "maoyuans"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
