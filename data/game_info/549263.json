It's a species that's been supposed to be extinct for years now, but there have been whispers of the odd Terran here and there at stations, on asteroids, and distant research planets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, an older Terran took it upon themselves to conduct experiments on her. Her back is filled with pieces of metal, that almost seem like shrapnel, and no doctor that she's visited has been able to guess what the purpose of these implants are. They can't remove them though, because of the proximity to her spinal cord. It causes her considerable pain to exist because of these implants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She's on a journey to discover herself, her past, and the fate of her species. And fix the cruel modifications to her body.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:05:36", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlbatrossDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
