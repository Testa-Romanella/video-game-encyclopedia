We wanted to make the game different from other spaceshooters by limiting your ability to shoot. The only way you can replenish your ammo is by absorbing asteroids or enemies, but be aware that absorbing enemies comes at a cost, it takes out some of your energy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Another key mechanic is the teleport. By not using the classic portrait view of different spaceshooters you are left with more room in which to move. To traverse this space more quickly or to dodge enemy attacks you can use the teleport. This also takes out a small portion of your energy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Last but not least, the most clasic mechanic in all spaceshooters, you can shoot down all the enemies on screen by using your ammo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     After you complete a sector you will be rewarded with an upgrade point. You can use these points to upgrade any of the seven different stats. All stats have a three tier progression, the more you want to upgrade it the more points it will cost. These stats are:<br/><br/><ul> <li>Max Health: Upgrades the maximum health of your ship, but keep in mind that you can only refill it with drops from the enemies.<br/> </li><li>Energy Regen: Your ship continuously regenerates energy. With this stat you can improve how fast this regeneration goes.<br/> </li><li>Max Ammo: The storage for ammunition on the ship is limited. By upgrading this stat you can now hold more ammunition.<br/> </li><li>Ship Speed: Sometimes all you want to do is just go faster, this gives you more speed.<br/> </li><li>Absorb Ammo: Each asteroid and enemy that you will absorb will give you more ammunition.<br/> </li><li>Absorb Range: If you every feel like you just can't reach what you wanted with the absorb you can upgrade its range.<br/> </li><li>Luck: Increases the chance of health drops from killed enemies.</li></ul>Game Modes<br/>The game features two distinct game modes: arcade and endless.<br/><br/>In Arcade mode you start out with three lives and have to go as far as you can while also trying to get the highest score. You will have to face 10 different sectors from each enemy faction, all filled with unique enemies, minibosses and bosses.<br/><br/>In Endless mode you only have one life available and the goal is to last as long as you can. Your ship will have maxed out upgrades and you will be constantly bombarded by a random assortment of enemies from all three factions.Enemies<br/> Because we wanted to make each world feel different we filled them with unique enemies. There are three main factions that you will need to battle throughout the game.War Faction<br/><br/><br/>Thought from birth that the only way to survive in life is to mercilessly beat down all who oppose you the war faction's arsenal reflects what it means to stay alive in this world. They are equipped with shields, deadly exploding mines and kamikaze pilots.Tech Faction<br/><br/><br/>     More interested in unraveling the mysteries of the universe than fighting, the tech faction has special ways with which to confuse the enemy. They are equipped with ships that can phase, shoot static energy fields and turn invisible.Chaos Faction<br/><br/><br/>     Wild and unpredictable the chaos faction strive on everything that doesn't make sense in the universe. Their motto is \"We'll find a way to make this work\". They are equipped with fast moving ships, special ammo that can temporarily blind you and big lasers.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/694/6942f7fe43be09f68fd0f52177b0a154.jpg", "website": "http://www.hollowsphere.eu/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HollowSphere"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HollowSphere"], "esrb_rating": null}
