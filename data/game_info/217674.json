You can compete in real-time online competitions for high scores.

The cars could spiral out of control; causing nausea, whiplash, or sudden death.<br/><br/>Our roller coasters use a realistic lift hill cable to pull the cars to the peak of the track.  Once the cars reach the peak, potential energy accumulated by the rise in height transfers to kinetic energy and the cars race downwards.  Some energy is lost to friction on the track itself.  The effects of gravity are taken into account to increase speed and accelerations accurately.  You can experience several G's of force on high-speed turns!<br/><br/>iRollerCoaster features:<br/>- Advanced OpenGL graphics<br/>- Music and sound effects<br/>- Online high score database<br/>- High-resolution textures<br/>- Compatible with iPad Pro<br/><br/>iRollerCoaster is brought to you by the makers of World Winter Games and iBASEjump.<br/><br/>Have fun with iRollerCoaster and enjoy the ride!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:57:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfd/dfd214ac4441535ce34258eb37518e25.jpg", "website": "http://www.svntr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sea Venture"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Sea Venture"], "esrb_rating": null}
