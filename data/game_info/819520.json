We drew inspiration from RTS games like starcraft, as well as aiming mechanics from games such as Angry Birds or Peggle. Its a hard-to-master fusion of dissimilar yet strangely harmonious genres that we really hope you'll enjoy!</p>\n<p>Instructions (The game does not have a tutorial. PLEASE READ)</p>\n<p>- click and drag on occupied towers to launch your explosive dice-mechs at your foes.</p>\n<p>- left-click to select dice in the field, and right click to move them towards your mouse.</p>\n<p>- if you move a dice-mech to one of the towers, it will mount itself in the tower.</p>\n<p>- don't let the enemies reach your base! If your health reaches zero, you lose!</p>\n<p>- Survive all six waves to win!</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>- Your dice-mechs automatically shoot at nearby enemies, but their guns are slow and weak.</p>\n<p>- Dice-mechs launched from towers roll until they come to a stop and then release a powerful AOE attack for their top face value.</p>\n<p>- Dice mounted in towers can still shoot, and they get a small bonus to their range.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Dice mechs are vulnerable to counterattack from enemies when not mounted in towers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- If your dice die, do not dispair! They'll respawn at your base.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T18:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99d/99d1ea5560946e3a436b7efdde6f3726.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["ShaunBartoo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
