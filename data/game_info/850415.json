{"id": 850415, "slug": "technology-monopoly-full-screen-only", "name": "Technology Monopoly (full-screen only)", "name_original": "Technology Monopoly (full-screen only)", "description": "<p>A spin off version of monopoly that involves building up an empire of technologies, upgrading them, and seeing which player can make the others go \"off the grid\". This version of monopoly is intended to be more balanced as the cost for upgrading (building houses) is significantly more expensive while the cost for the spaces remains relatively normal. The goal here is that even if someone gets a set it is not a death sentence as it can be in the original game. Other differences include 3 utility spaces, a 9 by 13 board, legal trouble (jail), and other unique cards and landing spaces. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T11:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb6/fb61c23a231c71cf90248b4e8995d376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tmdprogramming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
