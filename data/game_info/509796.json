The uploaded game is the goldmaster version, as shown for our final presentation. The scope is that of a demo or extended prototype, with three playable tracks.</p>\n<p>Please note that we're no longer actively working on this project. Given enough interest, we might be able to upload an update to fix some issues. For now, the development is on hold.</p>\r\nKnown Bugs &amp; Issues\r\n<p><strong>Pause-Menu</strong></p><p>The pause-menu can be opened, but not closed. We recommend not pressing the start-button while playing, as the menu-text will distract from playing.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Joining the Game</strong></p><p><em>Coldwheels</em>\u00a0doesn't have a singleplayer-mode - you need at least 2 players. When you reach this screen &amp; want to play with 3 or 4 players, quickly press the A-button, as the race will start soon after the first 2 players have joined.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:16:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f27/f27b1ab57f2f7dcfcc96b5ce8994491c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["numieth"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
