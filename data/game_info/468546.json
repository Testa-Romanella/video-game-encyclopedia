Fortunately, the submarine is in one piece, for now. Aided by a \"friendly\" ship's computer, familiarize yourself with the ship's chaotic mechanics and sail your way back to base! <br/>You'll have to contend with all sorts of problems, such as cracks in the hull taking in water, charging fuel cells to power the engine, dodging icebergs, and much worse... Have fun! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls : WASD and mouse</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Up and down arrow key to adjust the mouse senstitivity</strong></p>\n\n<p>(The voicelines and the advanced audio stuff didn't make it in time for the GMTK Jam.
