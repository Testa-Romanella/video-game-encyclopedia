In this demo, you can explore different locations and gather items! The game is still in early development so it is far from complete. If you have any ideas during or after a short play through of the demo, feel free to fill out the Google Form below!</p>\n<p><strong>Vision for Kinda Cute Rogue-like:</strong></p>\n<p>My goal for this project is to create a game which has no violence or combat. But focuses more on a casual playing style. So by adding features such as cooking, farming and (possibly) fishing, the Player can have fun without harming any digital creatures!</p>\n<p><strong>Once you've played the demo, I'd appreciate it if you fill out my Google Form to give feedback!</strong></p>\n<p>Form:\u00a0https://forms.gle/bM2vVAnTQx8YNWA29</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:42:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ad/0ad5081a6527c27deeedd9c8fb9f6ed7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris Richardson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
