The one constant is the movement, which is based on acceleration - although there exists a max speed.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was both a learning experience in the act of making a game and in toying around with mechanics. I was inspired by the implementation of minigames with typical \"turn-based rpg\" combat that popped up in various games, and wondered how I could try to fuse both real-time combat with a minigame of that flavor with no interruption. This is an attempt to answer that question.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's also the occasional \"hidden\" typo.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>AD TO TURN LEFT/RIGHT</p>\n<p>W TO ACCELERATE FORWARDS</p>\n<p>S TO ACCELERATE BACKWARDS</p>\n<p>SPACEBAR FOR BRAKES</p>\n<p>RIGHT CLICK = STREAM OF BULLETS<br/></p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK = CIRCLE OF BULLETS<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Programming/Art/Writing: Me <br/></p>\n<p>Music: Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio</p>\n<p>Scrolling dialogue:\u00a0 Kupoapo<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T08:03:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2ad692dc3ee381b60b85ff74373c4082.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crazi_Dev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
