{"id": 94787, "slug": "hack-n-slash-itch", "name": "Hack 'n' Slash (itch)", "name_original": "Hack 'n' Slash (itch)", "description": "<p>Hack 'n' Slash is a puzzle action game about hacking -- reprogram object properties, hijack global variables, hack creature behavior, and even rewrite the game's code. The only way to win is not to play...by the rules!</p>\n<p>The wizard has mandated that everyone confine themselves to the village, the castle armory has started to forge weapons so powerful that no one but guards are allowed to carry them, and anyone who attempts to find a sprite and demonstrate their bravery would face certain death. The new laws are for your own protection, but you don't buy it. You'll show everyone what \"brave\" means and, if you're clever, maybe uncover the secret reasons why everything's gone sideways.</p>\n<p>Key Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Use in-game tools to hack the game while you're playing it <br/>Your sword can hack the variables of objects. You find magic artifacts that allow you to tune global variables to your liking. Discover equipment that lets you see the game's internal debug visualization to uncover things that weren't meant to be seen. </li><li>Hack the code <br/>As you achieve advanced hacking mastery, you'll be able to dive directly into the game's assembly in the form of procedurally generated dungeons and modify the live-running code. </li><li>Make the game yours <br/>Puzzles have myriad solutions, many of which we haven't anticipated. As you master the game's hacking mechanics, you can mold and shape the game in whatever way you desire. </li><li>Crash it! <br/>You're hacking the game for real! You can totally break it. Roll back in time to change the rules so the bugs don't cause the world to fall apart, whether they're yours or ours! </li></ul>\n<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p>Windows Minimum</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Windows XP Service Pack 3</li><li>Processor: 1.7 GHz Dual Core</li><li>Memory: 2 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, ATI Radeon 4870 HD, Intel HD 3000, or equivalent card with at least 512 MB VRAM</li><li>DirectX: Version 9.0</li><li>Storage: 3 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible Sound Card</li><li>Additional Notes: Must have OpenGL 3 with GLSL version 1.3</li></ul>\n<p>Windows Recommended</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Windows 7</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, AMD Athlon 64 2.2Ghz</li><li>Memory: 3 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460, AMD Radeon HD 6850</li><li>DirectX: Version 11</li><li>Storage: 3 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible Sound Card</li><li>Additional Notes: Must have OpenGL 3 with GLSL version 1.3.</li></ul>\n<p>macOS Minimum</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8 or later</li><li>Processor: Intel Core Duo</li><li>Memory: 2 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: ATI Radeon HD 4850, NVIDIA GeForce GT 120, Intel HD 3000, or equivalent card with at least 512 MB VRAM</li><li>Storage: 3 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Must have OpenGL 3 with GLSL version 1.3</li></ul>\n<p>macOS Recommended</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Lion 10.7.X</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i series processor</li><li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 6770, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460</li><li>Storage: 3 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card: Compatible Sound Card</li><li>Additional Notes: Must have OpenGL 3 with GLSL version 1.3.</li></ul>\n<p>Ubuntu Minimum</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</li><li>Processor: 1.7 GHz Dual Core</li><li>Memory: 2 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, ATI Radeon 4870 HD, Intel HD 4000, or equivalent card with at least 512 MB VRAM</li><li>Storage: 3 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Must have OpenGL 3 with GLSL version 1.3</li></ul>\n<p>Ubuntu Recommended</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or higher</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, AMD Athlon 64 2.2Ghz</li><li>Memory: 3 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460, AMD Radeon HD 6850</li><li>Storage: 3 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Must have OpenGL 3 with GLSL version 1.3.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff6/ff6d4dfffcc13cc41e8ece6ac94e9aec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Double Fine Productions"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
