{"id": 513046, "slug": "clonk-planet", "name": "Clonk Planet", "name_original": "Clonk Planet", "description": "<p>In Clonk (Planet), the player controls small, humanoid beings - the so-called Clonks - within a two-dimensional, dynamically modifiable landscape using keyboard or mouse. Clonks interact with their surrounding landscape, animals, weather, buildings and objects. The game can be played alone or in multiplayer in split-screen or via local network or Internet. Four different keyboard settings, combined with the option of using a mouse or gamepad, result in allowing up to six players on one computer. The game goal depends on the scenario being played, varying between melees, in which players fight each other, strategical team siege scenarios and cooperative missions. <br />\nExpandability of the games is a core gameplay aspect and feature of the Clonk series. Several extensions were made over the years and offered for the registered users of the game. There are medieval (Knights), futuristic (Hazard), fantasy and &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; (Western) themed packs available. An elaborated scenario extension is Far worlds which features the deep sea, jungle and Arctic. The Western object pack was originally created for a design contest, but has been developed into an official extension.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-01T22:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef9/ef91b894f1dd2dd2358d51f11326cd5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["RedWolf Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
