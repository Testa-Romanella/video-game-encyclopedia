The theme for the jam was \"scarcity\".</p>\n<p>In Rusto's Adventure, you play as Rusto the robot scavenger. Explore a mysterious ancient cave in search of Bits, the robot currency of the future. The ancient technology in the cave can only be activated with\u00a0oil, something that is rarely found in the future - luckily, Rusto carries his trusty oil\u00a0tank!</p>\n<p>Rusto's Adventure is a platform / puzzle adventure game with 18 levels to explore.\u00a0The game took\u00a0approximately 52 hours to complete, with around 24 hours' actual work. All the art, design, coding, etc. was done by me. Sound effects and music are from freesound.org.</p>\n<p>Gameplay GIF:\u00a0https://giphy.com/gifs/9MITCznLkaAMDgEgWE/html5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a1/9a1b33708dc9f42f48674253414509d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aron Simpson"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
