This \u201cHeal \u2018em up\u201d encourages players to use teamwork and communication, as they have to coordinate their positions, timings and tasks as a team in order to succeed. The game aims to induce stress through the concept of no control, with players relying on their team mates to survive.</p>\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>The aim of the game is too keep everyone alive, by collecting colours from the environment and using these colours to heal other players (you cannot heal yourself!) and Hamsa's in the environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If one person dies, you all die.</p>\n<p>You win when the enemy is killed, which is the job of the Hamsa's. Hamsa's can only attack the enemy, if all the Hamsa's have health, if one Hamsa dies all the Hamsa's stop attacking. Hamsa's currently look like 3D stars or decagons.</p>\n\r\nWhat you need\r\n<ul><li><em>Hurry Hurry Heal Me</em>, needs 4 players.</li><li>You need 4 of the same controllers, either:<ul><li>xBox360</li><li>ps4</li><li>Nintendo Switch (you can use 2 sets of joy-cons)</li></ul></li><li>An Apple Mac</li></ul>\r\nFind Out More\r\n<ul><li>http://hurryhurryhealme.com/</li><li>https://twitter.com/hurryhealm...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/505/5057570555603180740d44a49465bfba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Bobbyberta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
