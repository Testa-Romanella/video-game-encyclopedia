You move the hammer with the mouse, and that&#39;s all there is. With practice, you&#39;ll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain.<br />\nTo quote Jazzuo himself: &quot;The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well&quot;.<br />\nClimb up an enormous mountain with nothing but a hammer and a pot.<br />\nListen as I make philosophical observations about the problem at hand.<br />\nBetween 2 and \u221e hours of agonizing gameplay, depending. The median time to finish for my playtesters was 5 hours, but the mean was closer to \u221e.<br />\nLose all your progress, over and over.<br />\nFeel new types of frustration you didn&#39;t know you were capable of.<br />\nMagical reward awaits hikers who reach the top.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-30T08:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/941/941f173c573feebf92d62fad118d004e.jpg", "website": "http://www.foddy.net/2017/09/getting-over-it", "rating": 3.6, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 72, "owned": 1402, "beaten": 106, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 234, "playing": 27}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 277, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 281, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Noodlecake Studios", "Bennett Foddy"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Bennett Foddy"], "esrb_rating": null}
