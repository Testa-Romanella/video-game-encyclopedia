Multiple types of explosions actually.  I couldn't think of what to make the tiles to make it more original, so they are all pictures of one of our artists, Tyler Ventura (also the assistant director for Chicago Fire).  Match like Tylers to make an older Tyler.  As Tyler gets older, he also gets more angry, and will explode younger Tylers near him.  You can also pay Tyler money to get younger, or simply destroy himself.</p><p>This can be played with Mouse/Keyboard, or Game Controller.</p><p>Made in early 2015, while still operating under the name Grumble Labs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4b/c4bc2c150a68139cf0af58f2d46852c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["grandtheftmarmot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
