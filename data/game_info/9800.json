{"id": 9800, "slug": "streets-of-rogue", "name": "Streets of Rogue", "name_original": "Streets of Rogue", "description": "<p>Streets of Rogue is a rogue-lite about player choice, freedom, and anarchic fun. The game takes inspiration from fast-paced top-down rogue-lites like Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne, and adds free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent gameplay elements of RPGs like Deus Ex.<br />\nRather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning, procedurally generated city, where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities.<br />\nIn order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.<br />\nWill you play as a soldier who shoots first and asks questions later?<br />\nA stealthy scientist who uses chloroform and tranquilizer darts to silently take down the opposition?<br />\nA genial bartender who can talk his way past the most intimidating of guards?<br />\nOr how about a hyper-intelligent gorilla, rescuing other caged gorillas to form a small mobilized gorilla army?<br />\nThe Mighty Feature-List<br />\nPlay the game YOUR way! Don\u2019t want to kill anybody? That\u2019s cool! Want to hack computers? Got ya covered!<br />\nRandom world generation and TOTALLY EXTREME gameplay variety means you can play for 600 hours and not get bored! Seriously though, go outside!!!<br />\nSuper-advanced artificial intelligence that won\u2019t put up with your crap! Outsmart these virtual humans and feel superior to your computer!<br />\nPlay as over 20 (and growing!) wildly different types of characters! Bartender, scientist, hacker, gorilla \u2014 hey, your job is probably in there too!<br />\nStupidly huge variety of items! Shrink rays, hypnotizing devices, boomboxes, bear traps, food processors.. Oh, and guns too.<br />\n4-Player online and local cooperative modes lets you brutalize goons AND loneliness!<br />\nLead a gang, free slaves, drink beer, gib ghosts, become a vampire, shrink people and stomp on them. The most insanely varied game ever made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T02:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31c/31c0408f9eba469663bcc531a98f6d3e.jpg", "website": "http://streetsofrogue.com/", "rating": 3.8, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 48, "owned": 1089, "beaten": 57, "toplay": 25, "dropped": 74, "playing": 15}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 305, "ratings_count": 157, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 157, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["tinyBuild", "Matt Dabrowski"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
