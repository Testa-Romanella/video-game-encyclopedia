To escape, you have to carefully manage your ammo, health, items and upgrades. All while shooting and blowing up bad robots. Death is permanent. Can you escape?<br/><br/>    \tThe game takes you through mazes filled with robots to kill and things to buy. Meanwhile, in each maze level, Helios will share his knowledge and ideas. Maybe you can reflect about them and find a meaning while wandering the corridors. Maybe not.<br/><br/>     \tAverage session is between 20 minutes and 1 hour. <br/><br/>        If you are having trouble playing, check the tips on the discussion forum.<br/><br/><h3>Features: </h3><h3>Physics:</h3> Most objects are physically simulated. Your bullets have weight and ricochet around. Getting punched by a heavy enemy will throw you away, jumping into a wall will bounce you back. Enemies can also be punched out of your way.<h3>Meaningful Decisions:</h3> There is a limited amount of resources. If you misjudge which items will be useful for your playthrough, things are gonna get complicated.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Seven Procedurally Generated Mazes:</h3> As you get deeper and deeper on the Vapormaze, the mazes become harder and more complex. New mazes are generated every playthrough.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Pistol:</h3> You have to manage your ammo while shooting. Be aware that running out of ammo means being vulnerable until the next Vending Machine is found.<h3>Punch Gun:</h3> Your own personal PunchGun\u2122 that punches almost anything and allows you to throw stuff and enemies out of the way.<h3>Bad Robots:</h3> Face robotic enemies that will try to kill you. Different robot types behave differently and try to kill you in different ways.<br/><br/><h3>Vapetron:</h3> A helpful bot, he will show you the way to a nearby vending machine. You must buy and manually place your Vapetron.<h3>Vending Machines:</h3> You'll find them around the maze. Buy the items you need to survive like ammo, health kits and exit signs to help on your journey.<h3>Upgrades:</h3> You can buy several upgrades for your gun to increase its efficiency, bullet speed and other attributes. You can also improve your movement capabilities. All upgrades are simultaneous e.g. if you got double bullets and faster bullets, they will both work.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Awesome Soundtrack:</h3> Some of the finest vaporwave music, crafted by Windows96.<h3>Helios Himself:</h3> Not really, it is just a statue. He says interesting things though.<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T14:52:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/470/47080bef6f62ed79436ec6fd16c62089.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Felipe Rodrigues"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Felipe Rodrigues"], "esrb_rating": null}
