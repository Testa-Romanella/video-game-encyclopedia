There is a surplus of robots needing repair and luckily you work at the repair factory. Complete tasks and minigames to <strong>fix the robots</strong> but dont mess up or youll end up like the buyers.</p>\n<p>90% of the game is just controlled by the <strong>mouse</strong>. It is <strong>straight forward</strong> and easy to get the hand of.</p>\n<p>I highly <strong>recommend downloading</strong> as it has a couple extra features and the overall experience is just better. If you are playing imbedded <strong>PRESS F11</strong> to go full screen or else the top is cut off.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first gamejam as a devoper and really excited to see what people think so <strong>feedback </strong>is much appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T10:47:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5d533ac95e512cfd86e20a67117d82e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Benbop"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
