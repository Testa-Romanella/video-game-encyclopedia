On this adventure the brave knight must fight his way through the different realms. The knight can acquire the help of companions though gaining their trust  or buy the help of mercenaries through the weight of his coin. Companions will fight harder and stay by your side no matter what, even if it means dying at your side. Mercenaries on the other hand will leave your service if your coin purse becomes a little too light for their liking.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T02:25:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec0/ec0de5984c952964f036e1f7c972a642.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NifftyGameWorks"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NifftyGameWorks"], "esrb_rating": null}
