If you love fast paced arcade style gameplay and crushing your enemies (quite literally), then this is the game for you!<br/><br/>Building Code Red has been the passion project of a small handful of developers over the past 6 months, in this short time we are pleased to have created something that we believe is fun and fully playable. While we know that not everything is polished to the level that we would love to see, we are keen to get the communities feedback and begin developing alongside your input!<br/><br/>We ask you to give Code Red a try, we hope that you enjoy your time here and ask for you to leave comments and critique that we can work with to improve things in the future.<br/><br/>Code Red is in Open Beta, some features may not work correctly, and this version of the game may be unstable at times. Please be patient and bare with us while we get things up and running.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T04:15:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a3930f1af6671d56f09c2c0e39c010a.jpg", "website": "https://www.coinmode.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoinMode", "Luke Andrews"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["CoinMode"], "esrb_rating": null}
