The \"enemies\" and the \"player\" are both on separate screens. The goal is to survive 3 stages.</p>\n<p>Colliding with \"bad vibes\" causes player to lose 1 HP. Collecting of the green heart adds 1HP.</p>\n<p>It is my first participation in Game Jams ever, so I hope you'll like this tiny game :) Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90d/90dd505c45f6692afce6fbfff3931824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shushpo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
