Well, I made a new ps1 style horror game (again). But I have improved a few graphics, optimization, story, quality and duration of the game. I think its passage will take from 12 minutes to 20-30. Movement: WASD There are also no interaction buttons like in the previous game. The game is not recommended for pregnant women, people with a weak psyche and just sick and weak people. I won\u2019t write system requirements, but if the game goes to 32bit, then you need to understand that it will work even on weak PCs. I will be glad if you RATE THE GAME, and do not write that it is \"normal\" or \"shit\". Special thanks to you, who is going to shoot a video on it. And also if you liked the game, like and subscribe to my profile itch :D Good luck!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOklL0NjyxFR6eBd_H04JAw</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T06:58:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94a/94a83232c2383fc0d7f68e27fefc6346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Backspace studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
