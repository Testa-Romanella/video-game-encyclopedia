There is a 'good' ending, a 'bad' ending, and a 'joke' ending available.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T06:51:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/1967be4535bb77547e1261d3a94d8bd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thighs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
