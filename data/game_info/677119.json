If that wasn't enough, the elections are coming up, and your rival is getting a lot of media coverage, so watch out!<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>The nation is unstable, the peaceful transfer of power is in peril, and democracy is on the decline...</p>\n<p>------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Grab topics from the TV and write them onto a bill. If the bill makes enough sense, it will be approved by congress, and you will be better regarded by a majority. Otherwise, if your bill is rejected, it will reduce your populatiry further.\u00a0You must choose which laws are the right ones to pass, because in the end only one side can win...</p>\n\n<p><em>Penny Hundredcoins</em></p>\n<p>------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left Mouse Button: literally everything</li></ul>\n<p>------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programming: Whycardboard\u00a0</li><li>Art &amp; Graphic Design: Mateus Boga</li><li>Game Design: Whycardboard, Mateus Boga</li><li>SFX &amp; Voiceacting: Mateus Boga</li><li>Music:\u00a0\"Night in Venice\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li></ul>\n<p>------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Special thanks to: Yoris and 100th_Coin<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------</p>\n<p>A\u00a0side note: During the final moments of development, the library we were using to render text decided to break itself... so very last minute, we had to redesign *all of the text in the entire game*.
