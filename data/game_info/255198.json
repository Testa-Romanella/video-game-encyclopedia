You can tap again if your previous blocking is successful, otherwise,  you have to wait for a couple of seconds before you can create another blocking.<br/><br/>Lots of other dots and even bowls are there to make the falling paths of red dots change at the last second, so you have to be both fasty and smarty in blocking them!
