There are 4 demons unleashed inside Enigmatik, plus their master, named \"The Question\". Watch ENIGMATIK's Lore to learn more about The Question (English with subtitles):<br/></p>\n<p>The four demons are:</p>\n<ol><li>\n<p><strong>Pazuzu, Lord of the Winds</strong>. Location: the Maze. Seal: a red star.\r\nWanted sacrifice: you have to guess it!</p>\n</li><li>\n<p><strong>Ningishzid, the Serpent God</strong>. Location: the Serpent temple. Seal: a green quadrifolium. Wanted sacrifice: you have to guess it!</p>\n</li><li>\n<p><strong>Seshat, the Goddess of Calculations</strong>. Location: the Sudoku garden. Seal: a cyan diamond. Wanted sacrifice: you have to guess it!</p>\n</li><li>\n<p><strong>Heyoka, the Sacred Clown</strong>. Location: the Echo chamber. Symbol: a four sided magenta fractal. Wanted sacrifice: you have to guess it!</p>\n</li></ol>\n<p>You need to recover the seals of the demons. Each time you make a sacrifice on each location, you win a part of a seal of that demon. When you obtain 10 seals, the demon is finally sealed. Be aware: winning a game in a location is not the same as obtaining a seal of a sacrifice.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Game\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>It is the mission of the player to discover what is the required sacrifice for each demon. Once you manage to seal the four demons, their master, The Question, will be summoned to you and a final event will happen. Good luck.</p>\n<p>PD: oh, one more hint: every four games, if you have won three of them, a bonus game will start: if you win it, a random piece of a seal of one of the demons will be given to you for free.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The whole keyboard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:48:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caa/caaad232e8bdce8d7fcdad19f9042dda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Furillo Productions"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
