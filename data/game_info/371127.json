Welcome to my game page.</p>\n<p>This game, yes, this one right here, was made for the Community Game Jam thingy. It'll probably say that in the top right corner too so I don't know why I'm saying it now. The theme was \"The Game is a Lie\".</p>\n<p>So basically, it's a platformer. A pretty basic one at that. You'll probably play it thinking that I just lied about how basic it is. I'll let you go do that. Imma admit now that it really isn't the highest quality game, the reason being that it's the first project of this complexity that I've ever actually completed, so don't say I didn't warn you.</p>\n<p>Anyways, kind browser, I hope you have a good day and maybe consider playing my game. I spent a week on it after all, and would love It if at least 7.2 people were to try it.</p>\n<p>Oh yes, and I forgot to include the font I use throughout the game and in the thumbnail in the credits, so I should mention that it is \"3Dventure\" by memesbruh03. (Unless they just happened to be the person to post it to DaFont.)</p>\n<p>(Please not that this game\u00a0<em>does</em> have a soundtrack, it's just that there is a large government conspiracy set to hide its existence in order to prevent it from topping the charts infinitely.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:28:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c87cb1255d6c2dd0aea03bb13eaaec5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fover"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
