You appear in a large, open-to-explore arena and you need to find five drawings of an old oak tree to complete the level. However, it's not that simple. Evil memes are everywhere. They're out for your blood. They will chase you wherever you go and of course they will stop you from collecting drawings. Use a wide arsenal of firearms to get rid of these annoying entities from the lower internet. Collect all the oak drawings and defeat the boss!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The essence of the gameplay:</strong><br/>At the very beginning, you have a choice of 3 game levels, as well as a training level where you can try out all available weapons and train your accuracy. Once at the game level, you need to explore it to find 5 pieces of the oak image. Funny entities that periodically appear in random places will interfere with you. If you still manage to find all the pictures, you will have a battle with the boss.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T07:17:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f2342f9d436484e47a8dae486aa3b6a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 466, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Performance Artist"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Performance Artist"], "esrb_rating": null}
