Her personality is shaped by the player's choices and the truth about her will be slowly revealed in the full story.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tHe is an unwanted child, who was raised by his father in a small Gwenyan farm. Being with horses since young, he had more animals than he had friends. His love for animals drove him to do odd jobs and take up a loan to qualify as a wildlife biologist. After moving out of home, he gradually learnt to interact with others, but showing his real emotions only to his closest animal friends. He seems to be able to communicate with animals.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tBorn with a silver spoon in his mouth, Stan was the son of a boxing champion and racing driver. In a family where career mattered more than family, he had little memory of any interaction with his parents. He was the eldest of three kids at home, and naturally this made him the most responsible member of the group. Perhaps the thirst for excitement is in his lineage - he trained to be a military pilot once graduated from high school.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tKind, sweet, and endearing, Estelle is always keen to give back to the community.

He is the second of three brothers, son of a businessman, and citizen of Heilbronn. Things change when his father's business went bust.
