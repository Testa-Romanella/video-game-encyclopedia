I have begun to write a story about a cave, as exploring the folders is relatable to enter a cave - you don't know its size and what you will find in it, and you enter rooms and tunnels.</p>\n<p>But, without any particular reason, I never finished writing it. Today I am not really motivated enough to finish everything, but I think that this can still be interesting in this state - because it's the process of making the game with folders that interested me, over the story.</p>\n<p>I hope that some people who would like to make games but don't know how to program will find this example useful and that it will prove them you can make something without advanced skills... But just by working with what you already know :)</p>\n<p>Have a nice play !</p>\n<p>All the pictures were taken from Wikimedia Commons : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c362805abfac5785bdf2f770a47c9be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HeskHwis"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
