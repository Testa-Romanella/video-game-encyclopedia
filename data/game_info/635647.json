With gameplay inspired by Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival (seriously). You are encouraged to share your own memories as well for other players to see (if you choose to submit anything, that is).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Virtual Vacation Zone</em></strong> was made for Nicole He's VACATION-themed stream from July of 2021. While I decided on a mood I wanted to portray in the game, I didn't actually have any gameplay ideas until very last minute. I'm not sure exactly where the final product came from but I'm weirdly proud of it. It's not a full narrative experience like <em>Extreme Tax Masters</em>, but instead it's something completely different.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Tipz</strong></p>\n<p>The gameplay is hopefully self explanatory? Just click or press space to advance through things.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T06:10:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3d/f3d587f8f12f3628589b588d591e237d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Natalie Martin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
