Good thing they bought a gun with them!</p>\n<p>This game is for the GMTK game jam 2022, It was made\u00a0 within 48 hours\u00a0 and uses a mix of assets I\u00a0 made within the time frame and assets from Unreal Engines Megascasns library. I set out to make a game inspired\u00a0 by COD Zombies. I think I succeeded but wish I\u00a0\u00a0 had time to implement more game mechanics to do with chance. With more time I\u00a0was going to make it so the big dice in the main room could be rolled for random events to happen, some good, some bad.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! Let me know which wave you got to or if you beat the game!\u00a0</p>\r\nKnown Bugs;\r\n<p>- Zombies sometimes group up and get stuck outside entrance zones</p>\n<p>- Some lighting issues</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T23:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f53/f537bbc6386e22c0dd7d37a11260087c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SirNewtz"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
