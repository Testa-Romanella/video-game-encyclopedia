Many thanks to\u00a0http://twitter.com/mfisherart for character art and other help.</p>\n<p>This game's core mechanics are based on the Game Boy Color game The Legend Of Zelda: Oracle Of Ages. Link could get a mermaid suit in that game which allowed for faster swimming and deep sea diving, but with slightly awkward controls of tapping the dpad. This unorthodox control scheme turned into a gimmick, and then I decided to double down on the gimmick and let the player grab and throw things using just the directional controls.</p>\n<p>Check the ESCAPE menu for a control scheme that requires less button pressing. I made sure most enemies won't attack you from offscreen but if you find yourself dying a lot try moving more slowly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39a/39a1c13c0527f3f7b23e5c6f9e7bbfd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["koboldskeep"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
