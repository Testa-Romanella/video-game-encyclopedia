To help you, I'Ve written the default controls below:\r\n<p>Arrow keys: Move/Navigate Menus</p>\n<p>X: Jump</p>\n<p>S: Hydro Charge*</p>\n<p>C: Crouch**</p>\n<p>Enter: Pause</p>\n\n<p>*The Hydro Charge is a 4-directional dash that you charge by holding the S key or what you set as the sub-action 1 key. When you release the sub-action 1 key, you launch in the direction you're pressing. It also lets you bend upwards, downwards, to the left or to the right depending on the direction you dashed.</p>\n<p>** You can combine crouching with jumping and the hydro charge\u00a0for more versatility.</p><p><strong>Any amount of feedback is greatly appreciated, you can give feedback on the itch.io community or the following discord server:\u00a0</strong>https://discord.com/invite/aMA6PP9<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T12:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/693fa624852e82a5f2d777f19d35acd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Philraco Indie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
