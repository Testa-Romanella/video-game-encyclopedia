Of the time that was available, I was only able to spare a small part of this actually game developing. For this I have only been able to produce a small part of what I actually would have liked to have made.</p>\n<p>My idea was that through landscaping, the player earns money which they would then spend on presents for their pet rabbit. At the end of the week depending on how much money the player has earned. The rabbit is showered with more gifts.</p>\n<p>This game was designed on details provided to me about the person who would be receiving this game. This person works as a landscaper currently and has a pet rabbit. So I thought that would be enough for me to work off.<br/></p>\n<p>I have thought of some nice ideas for this game but, again, have not been able to include them in this product that you can download. I shall see if I can add this into the game in the future but for now. Is just the foundations for what I would have liked to have made.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Music from\u00a0Zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T12:09:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d91/d912814337f4f79c7bc4e1348626103c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RS_Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
