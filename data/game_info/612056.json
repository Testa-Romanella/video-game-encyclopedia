What will she find, and where will she end up?<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Hello...! o/ First ever RPG Maker project, made in XP because... That's what I own. XD Uhm. It is a very short game, with all the art work and music made by myself. O^O This entire project began with the simplest of tools, a pencil and paper. Everything, absolutely everything in the game was first made with traditional art, and then recreated with pixel art, using another basic program. Something which everyone has I think. :P</p>\n<p>Since I had a lot of free time, I decided to learn how to use the engine with the help of several YouTube tutorials, old forums online, and of course, with the guidance from one of my 'stars'. ^///^</p>\n<p>I hope that if you choose to download this game, you enjoy it. Just be warned though, it is supposedly a \"prologue\"... A very short one, for the upcoming project I plan to create someday... Unfortunately, I cannot share too much information about that because I like secrets and surprises.
