{"id": 20970, "slug": "litil-divil", "name": "Litil Divil", "name_original": "Litil Divil", "description": "<p>Litil Divil is a puzzle game developed by Gremlin Graphics Software.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Mutt is a lost little devil. He hears a story of a Mystical Pizza that can be eaten only if you pass the Labyrinth of Chaos. The only thing is required to enter the Labyrinth - make a step through a Portal of Mortals, which a tiny demon accomplishes.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game fuses together platforming, action, and puzzle elements together and creates a unique gameplay experience. This is not an easy game, as Mutts health constantly drops (although at a low rate), the traps of the labyrinth are very well hidden and take a large portion of health if Mutt is caught into them, and the unique monsters of the game want to have Mutt for dinner. There is only one way to defeat a monster, and it is to use a specific item that can randomly spawn on the level. In any other cases, your only option is to run away.</p>\n<p>There is no autosave system present in the game. However, it is still possible to save your progress, as there is a bedroom behind one of the doors of the labyrinth. It is also possible to find a shopkeep, who will help you with items to fight the monsters only if you have the needed sum of money. It is impossible to know what is there behind a door without opening it.</p>\n<p>Upon entering a level, the players have to defeat an ogre that guards the entrance to the level. The player&#39;s health on the level depends on the outcome of that encounter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:51:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67e654f926344bd8d4f6170d43e8a45e.jpg", "website": "http://kiss-ltd.co.uk/", "rating": 1.9, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 43, "owned": 1140, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 39, "suggestions_count": 527, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 39, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Classic Macintosh", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gremlin Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kiss", "Funbox Media", "Blue Moon Red Owl", "Gremlin Interactive", "Additional publishers:"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
