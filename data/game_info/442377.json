The only thing you remember is your name. You'll need to find a way out of the Asylum. You'll learn more about the Black Soul Curse and what it does. This is a short story. Game length should be between 45 minutes to 2 hours. There is a bit of grinding if you want to stand a chance against bosses and mini-bosses. You can rest at the camp fire to regain HP and MP.</p>\n<p>P.S: First game made with RPG Maker, so any constructive criticism is more than<br/>appreciated. Thank you for playing my game :D.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c56444ee9d30c2f2e5c6dc3a0c7cd7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KristoRails"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
