I made it in a week - and still got an A <em>lol</em>.</p><p>The game is really simple, your job is to plant as much plants as you can. You are in a heavy time pressure, so you mustn't waste any time. By selling your crops, you gain money and time to plant other crops. It's actually quite entertaining.</p><p><strong>Instructions to be a successfull farmer:</strong></p><p>You can sell seed packets, crops themselves and boxed crops.</p><p>1. Seed packets give you almost nothing.</p><p>2. Crops give you less time but more money.</p><p>3. Boxed crops give you less money, but more time + their processing takes some time.</p><p>The shop's costs\u00a0scale with your playtime.</p><p><strong>The gameplay is just an infinite loop of you growing and selling crops.</strong></p><p>Just don't forget to take care of your plants - there are bubbles above them with an image of a\u00a0tool. They require that you find that tool and hurry up to them to and spam the hell out of them with that tool. Imagine that you're just a texas farmer caring for his crops.</p><p>You can only hold one tool at a time and you HAVE TO return them back to their place, you can't just throw them around, why would you ?</p><p>If you won't\u00a0(or aren't able to) help a plant, their heart icon will slowly drain out. If you don't do anything even then - the plant will die, with nothing in return.</p><p><strong>Just don't let the time run out lol, you'll lose.</strong></p><p>Controls are written in the starting screen, just play and you'll figure it out yourself.</p><p>I'm actually <em>very slowly</em> working on a nice remake of this game. It's release may or may not happen one day.</p><p>There's only one thing of which I'm kinda afraid - I think that WebGL (being a fag as always) actually breaks mouse movement of the game, making the player's vision snap from place to place without any reason. If it happens - sorry, brother.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T10:35:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7af390d48896ad67035aa7d471cc3bac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Red Havoc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
