{"id": 572681, "slug": "anti-air-strike", "name": "Anti AIr Strike", "name_original": "Anti AIr Strike", "description": "<p>Anti AIr Strike is a first person shooter tower defense game. Control three unique turrets with their own playstyle, upgrades and voice personality, as you and your Artificial Intelligence (AI) tower defend against endless waves of hostile drones! To win? Launch a full-scale Anti-Air Missile (AAM) from your tower, known as <em>\"The End\"</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This project was developed and released in July 2017 as one of our very first public game project, with credits to the amazing vocal talent and artists that helped complete this game\u00a0voluntarily. I have decided to make it publicly available to play on the web as an archived game. To us, its important to never forget where and how you started.</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Because this game was developed so long ago and most of the original project files are archived, this game no longer has any support or future updates planned. Some content or in-game links may not work as expected.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Voice of \"Gattlin\"</strong> -<strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>A-log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Voice of \"Lectric\" -\u00a0</strong><strong><strong>TrueMyriad</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Voice of \"Laser\" -\u00a0</strong><strong><strong>Christina Nicholls</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Voice of \"General\" -\u00a0</strong><strong>The Chadderbox</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Voice of \"Control Tower\" -\u00a0</strong><strong><strong>leekou</strong></strong>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sound Designer -\u00a0</strong><strong>jturner</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music Composer -\u00a0</strong><strong>Aaron Bilodeau</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Character Portrait Artist -\u00a0<strong>IxurCafe</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Shop Icons Artist\u00a0-\u00a0<strong>Smeep</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Visual Artist\u00a0-\u00a0<strong>MkattS</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>HUD &amp; Texture Artist\u00a0-\u00a0<strong>Phyro</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Programmer -\u00a0</strong>Dibbie<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2f/f2f7f6f3e2eb6c6fa8f613876d9d5814.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dibbie"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
