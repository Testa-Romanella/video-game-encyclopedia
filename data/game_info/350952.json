Think of it as a four-dimensional zoo, a living museum, or an interactive documentary. This VR experience gives the traditional three-dimensional virtual reality experience the addition of travel through time. It un-cages the animals and brings them to life, freeing you (and your students) to explore with them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou, the time traveler, explore ancient habitats and observe species \u2013 from the first bacteria to powerful dinosaurs to modern mammals \u2013 in action as they struggle to survive in their environment. Each life-form the time traveler encounters will have a corresponding recorded narration, playable on demand during the exploration. Our aim is threefold: popularize science, create an engaging VR-based curriculum for teachers to use in the classroom, and provide an awe-inspiring virtual reality adventure that everyone on Earth can enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a8786c7a52d13fe86b8bc388ad3fcee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hollowhead"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Hollowhead"], "esrb_rating": null}
