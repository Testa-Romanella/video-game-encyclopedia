Added some game features! Although I haven't programmed an end screen yet. More wanted to update that game so that the levels would actually end if you got all the blocks.\u00a0Also updated the colour palette generator so that it generates correctly. Better devlog available on git.</p>\n<p>Please note it is totally possible to create unbeatable levels. The chance is pretty low though.</p>\n<p>Do stuff with it on GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/JustDryan/Generative_Arkanoid</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:34:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19b/19b016e982e1f728715b3b1ac1ef8e97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dan Ryan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
