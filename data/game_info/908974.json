There are so many more ideas I had, but couldn\u2019t get to.\r\n</p>\n<p>The idea was to try and combine a high-speed arcade game with a farming-sim, since most farming games are slow-burns.\r\n</p>\n<p>I wanted things like power ups, more enemy types, deployable traps, deeper progression, actual objectives, etc, but yeah there\u2019s only so much time. People hated on the Harvest theme, and yeah it\u2019s really \u201con the nose\u201d as far as what people are going to be able to do with the theme, I\u2019m excited to see who knocked it out the park or came at it with a good twist.\r\n</p>\n<p>BUT I personally learned a lot from the theme because I\u2019d probably never try to make a farming sim on my own. It was a great opportunity to try something a little different. Hopefully yall enjoy what I was able to slap together, thanks for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T15:26:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a7171e0bc52381b3c04ef5f6d38d6144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Ismael Rodriguez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
