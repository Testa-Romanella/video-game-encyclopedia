That all changed when her \u201cbest friend\u201d (hah!) April came around, offering Sally a \u201cchance of a lifetime\u201d. Sally, bless her, chooses only to see the good in people, and actually listened to April. Next thing you know, she\u2019s sold her salon and used all her savings to become co-owner of Happyville, a luxurious spa.<br/><br/>And that\u2019s when the real chaos started\u2026 April is fixated on earning a Mirage star for the spa and is willing to do anything - and everything - to get one! Sally doggedly insists April isn\u2019t as bad as she looks.
