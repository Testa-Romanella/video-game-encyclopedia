(Also, my second published game ever~)</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to gather a school of space sharks,\u00a0 making sure they survive by eating scap metal floating around in space. If you don't eat enough and let the hunger bar deplete, then one of your sharks will perish!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD or Directional Arrows to move the camera around</li><li>The sharks follow the pointer, and will automatically eat scrap metal when they get close</li><li>I think it's best played in fullscreen</li></ul>\n<p>Beware: as time passes the hunger bar will deplete faster!</p>\n<p>It's a simple game, maybe a bit janky in its controls, but I like seeing the sharks move around. I was inspired by this video of Sebastian Lague about boids: I even considered adapting his code in 2D, before realising that it may be a little too much for a 3 day long\u00a0jam ahah. I don't know if I will update this game - maybe if you have some suggestions I might consider them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All these assets are free to use and under the Creative Commons Attribution License, except where specified.
