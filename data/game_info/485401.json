If so please give me some feedback here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/LYyTWTJqU7hfJUvY8\r\n\r\nAbout Overpopulation\r\n<p>Overpopulation is a dystopian game set in what we today know as Washington. The world is overpopulated, and unemployment, homelessness and crime is a normal sight in those times. As a desperate measure. The government of Washington has decided to kill of all the bad people to get the population down. You apply for the one of the jobs where you must go over peoples records and decide of they can live another day, or continue, and never be seen again\u2026</p>\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>-In\u00a0 the office you have different \"papers\" these show information about the person, and they shall help you decide if the person can survive or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-When you have decided a persons fate click on the corresponding button.</p>\n<p>-Continue this for each person in the day</p>\n<p>-There are 5 days</p>\n\n\r\nInfo\r\n<p>The game was originally made for a\u00a0Ludum Dare\u00a0game jam (play it\u00a0here). And now it is being ported to VR. I have taken the critiques we got and improved the game. I hope to get the beta version out as soon as possible. And then start to make the full game.
