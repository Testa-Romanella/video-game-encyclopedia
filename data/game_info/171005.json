I use this for logging progress in the game and general stuff, post my art there, whatever.</p>\n<p>Preface:</p>\n<p> I was actually working on a hex editor with tile-viewing (ROM Hacker) before this game. Before I lost internet, I was playing a ton of RPG-MO, so maybe it was the withdrawl, but that was months ago, but I actually took the concepts of this game from a dream. I dream rarely, but that dream was fun as shit and I didn't want to wake up, so when I did, I wrote it all down. It's changed a good deal since then, there was no gathering or crafting, all the skills were combat related, and battles were more traditional RPGlike in the dream. The original idea was, you run through a dungeon with a fixed amount of enemies, get enounters, your skills would auto tick down and have their own progress bars, upgradable from rare items, Skill Bottles. The field was just where you ran through to get to the dungeon. I decided make the skills utility related very early on in development, as I thought it'd make for a more interesting, varied game. I think I made the correct choice. I didn't realize it until it was too late, but I basically took Runescape/RPG-MO and turned it into a single player idle game.</p>\n<p> This game was written ontop of, and using assets from, a demo that's about 90% complete, called Dirty Bumper. It's an exploration-based top-down action RPG with combat similar to the Ys games. Most of the graphics come from that game, and the graphics code is mostly from a library I wrote for love while developing that demo.</p>\n<p> Everything should be explained well in game by talking to the various NPCs, or be very obvious, but I might have missed something. If something seems complicated (I tried to make it all really simple) let me know by email <joseph.stevens.pgh@gmail.com></joseph.stevens.pgh@gmail.com></p>\n<p> All the NPCs in the game offer both flavor text and helpful information, as does idling in town.</p>\n<p> This readme is meant to explain basic concepts, incase anything is unclear, not to be an entire game guide.</p>\n<p>Game Flow/How to Play:</p>\n<p> if you tap/click the screen, or press the space bar, you charge your aura power by a little bit. when the aura is active, almost every cooldown in the game goes at double speed, some actions are more likely to trigger.</p>\n<p> If something is highlighted when you mouse over it, you can click it. Clicking skills will give you an explanation of what they do, clicking actions does them, whatever.</p>\n<p> The game has keyboard controls. Up/Down to navigate the action menu, Z to activate an action, and spacebar to charge aura. The keyboard concept was mostly dropped, although if I give the game a steam release, I'll make everything navigable possible with keyboard/gamepad.</p>\n<p> Every area except the dungeon gains experience every frame just by you being there. The dungeon only levels up when you clear it.</p>\n<p> Area levels, in general, help you do things better, or faster, in that area. The town level helps town regen and charisma events, field level will make you explore faster, smithy levels let you smith faster, etc.</p>\n<p> You also have a Character level, and a Class level. Character level goes up from killing enemies. Class level goes up by 1 when you find a successor.</p>\n<p> A higher character level means better HP/Attack/Defence</p>\n<p> A higher class level means the class special ability will be more effective</p>\n<p> You have 8 basic skills, that gain experience when being used. Higher level = faster skill usage, better success rates, and for Mining, Smithing, Jewelry, Fishing, and Cooking, you unlock new stuff at levels 20 and 40.</p>\n<p> There are 6 Rebirth skills, the only way to level these up is by finding a successor, or buying a skill scroll from the gem shop.</p>\n<p> So, the flow and point of the game? Make numbers bigger! Level up your character, learn some skills and level those up, train a new character, who will inherit your skills, and do it all over again until you're satisfied.</p>\n<p>Aura mechanics</p>\n<p> auratimer (aura charge) goes down each frame. </p>\n<p> tapping charges the aura by a random value, the max of which is upgradable</p>\n<p> aura charge has a max - this is upgradable in the shop. the aura will always go down at the same speed, meaning a higher max charge will let you not-tap the screen more.</p>\n<p> I'm considering making the Auror skill lower the aura decay speed, but it's unlikely.</p>\n<p>Gem Shop:</p>\n<p> The gem shop is effectively the cash shop, although right now I don't have any way to accept payment. The alpha build will start you off with a few thousand gems. I recommend buying a skill scroll so you can test out every skill, but it's your call on how to use them.</p>\n<p> You can also gain gems ingame from rare events. Charisma events, the rarer treasure chests, and explore events are the main way to gather them.</p>\n<p> You can buy skill bottles with the gems, or material packs. Or you can change your aura color.</p>\n<p>Locations:</p>\n<p> Town:Healing and Charisma events</p>\n<p> Shop:upgrade your aura, buy buffs, garunteed location for Mining, Smithing, and Jewelry skills</p>\n<p> Smithy:Forging and Jewelry location</p>\n<p> Kitchen: Cooking location</p>\n<p> Field:Exploration location, quite a large amount of events. Scavenge unlocks more events, you can also find skill traders with random skills here, and this is where you go to find your successor to rebirth. Campable</p>\n<p> Dungeon: This is the farmable treasure chest location, but it increases in floors each time you clear it. You can also mine here. Campable.</p>\n<p>Skills:</p>\n<p> Camping:Restores an amount of HP based on its level, and your max hp. Cooldown gets lower as it gains levels</p>\n<p> Mining:gathering skill for forging and jewelry</p>\n<p> Forging:make bars, upgrade your weapons/armor for an attack/defence bonus. this bonus is seperate from your base stats and hidden, but wont affect buffs</p>\n<p> Jewelry:make bars, make jewelry, it gets sold immediately. This skill is intended to gather money</p>\n<p> Fishing:gathering skill for cooking</p>\n<p> Cooking:cook food, eat it to give yourself a natural regen boost in dungeons/field, or trade it to chel for a chance of items</p>\n<p> Charisma:random NPCs will visit your town, possibly giving you stuff.</p>\n<p> Scavenger:you'll find new events in the field, including events that boost your max hp, give you experience to other skills, and whatnot</p>\n<p> --</p>\n<p> Dungeoner:dungeon floors are shorter by 1 enemy per level, but enemies also get stronger (in the field as well). maxed at 5</p>\n<p> Auror:your aura has a chance to auto-trigger, letting you do things faster while idling. I haven't decided what the max for this should be</p>\n<p> Learning:all EXP you gain is increased by 10% per level, maxed at 5</p>\n<p> Weaponmaster: you gain +10% attack per level</p>\n<p> Armormaster: you gain +10% defence per level</p>\n<p> Lovely:upon rebirth, your character level, and all area levels, except the dungeon, are increased by 1 per level. This will allow you to do things faster immediately, and get through dungeons earlier</p>\n<p>Smithing formulas:</p>\n<p> copper + tin bronze bar</p>\n<p> iron iron bar</p>\n<p> iron + coal steel bar</p>\n<p>Skill Bottles:</p>\n<p> You can learn or level skills with skill bottles at the shop, or from random tradesmen in the fields.</p>\n<p> If you don't know a skill, using a skill bottle is required to learn it.</p>\n<p> If you already have a skill learned, using a skill bottle on it will level it up by 1. I'm considering making very high level skills take more than 1 skill bottle.</p>\n<p>Gamble Coins:</p>\n<p> The original idea was watch ad = garunteed better treasure chest. Kongregate is my first target for the game, and they're not offering the whole ad thing anymore, though. Maybe for mobile!</p>\n<p> Gamble coins let you re-roll a treasure chest before opening, and possibly other future events. each time you use a gamble coin on a chest, the minimum roll will go up a bit. Gamble coins don't garuntee a better result, but they do give you a better chance at a better result.</p>\n<p>Gems:</p>\n<p> Premium currency. Only usable in the Gem Shop, you can buy good things. Small amounts of gems can be find from events and treasure chests, so the premium items aren't entirely cash-locked if you play enough. Cash/Gems ratio is undecided as of yet.</p>\n<p>Classes:</p>\n<p> Classes level up by 1 on rebirth.</p>\n<p> At levels 5 and 10, classes get new titles, possibly new abilities</p>\n<p> max class level is 10</p>\n<p> Base classes</p>\n<p>Thief: High attack, low defence, (10% + class level) dodge chance in combat</p>\n<p>Warrior: High HP, (10% + class level) critical hit chance in combat.</p>\n<p>-- unimplemented classes</p>\n<p>Tourist - low stats, will randomly enter the field or dungeon after a set time, if in town with full HP. At levels 5 and 10, base stats go up.</p>\n<p>Wizard - low defence, attacks inflict bleed at (10% + class level), each strike dealing more damage per hit.</p>\n<p>Priest - low attack, high defence and HP, will skip an attack to heal every (20 - class level) attacks.</p>\n<p>Lancer - very high attack, low defence, low hp. will jump, giving garunteed dodge every (20 - class level) attacks</p>\n<p>Shaman - low stats, but starts battles with a totem that will absorb (10% + class level) of your HP.</p>\n<p>Dark Mage - high attack, low defence, attacks inflict a random status effect at (5% + .5 * class level)</p>\n<p>Gambler - stats are distributed randomly, skill is Lucky - all die rolls get increased.</p>\n<p> NPC classes - </p>\n<p>undecided on how to unlock them, or if they'll just be very rare</p>\n<p>Young Man</p>\n<p>Young Woman</p>\n<p>Boy</p>\n<p>Girl </p>\n<p>Bunny (Merchant)</p>\n<p>Smithy (Blacksmith)</p>\n<p>Chel (Chef)</p>\n<p>Old Man</p>\n<p>Old Woman</p>\n<p>Beastman citizen</p>\n<p>Beastwoman citizen</p>\n<p> * Monster classes - </p>\n<p>undecided if they'll have skills, possibly just high stats</p>\n<p>every monster you face will have a chance to be shiny, killing a shiny monster will unlock that monster as a possible successor</p>\n<p>Planned Features:</p>\n<p> Pre-Launch:</p>\n<p>More events: I want at least 100 outcomes from exploring with scavenging, and a good deal more charisma events</p>\n<p>More classes: 2 isn't very many classes, I'd like to have at least 4 classes for launch, and maybe monster classes</p>\n<p>Fishing: should be able to, rarely, fish up gold or other items</p>\n<p>Mining: Ore is already very valuable, but maybe a rare gem chance</p>\n<p>Cooking: More food trading results</p>\n<p>Offline progress</p>\n<p>Daily Rewards - Every day you get a chest containing Gold, Gems, Gamble Coins, or (every 10 days) Skill Bottles</p>\n<p>**** Proofread and adjust all status text, some of it is likely outdated</p>\n<p> Soon:</p>\n<p>Being able to actually buy gems</p>\n<p>Launching Publically on the following platforms, in order:</p>\n<p>Kongregate Launch</p>\n<p>Android appstore release</p>\n<p>Steam release (Win/Mac/Linux)</p>\n<p>iOS release</p>\n<p>Variants on monsters:</p>\n<p>Large mob stat boost</p>\n<p>Small mob stat nerf</p>\n<p>Shiny mob class learned when killed</p>\n<p>Smart mob crits sometimes</p>\n<p>Dumb mob misses sometimes</p>\n<p>Greedy mob carries a random item, any item from copper to skill bottles</p>\n<p> Iffy:</p>\n<p>Double/Triple auras</p>\n<p>being able to overcharge the aura past 100%/200% etc would give a super aura, making the aura more effective during its timespan.</p>\n<p>this would require some sort of rare item to unlock, similar to skill bottles to unlock skills for the first time, and would level up through the same rare item</p>\n<p> Far off:</p>\n<p>Far off being, at least post kongregate launch, possibly post-all platform release. Working on this stuff depends on the game's reception.</p>\n<p>Pets</p>\n<p>pet will follow you around, and give some sort of boost</p>\n<p>Areas</p>\n<p>Market</p>\n<p>new town area, will hold more shops, npcs, and skill locations</p>\n<p>Skills</p>\n<p>Woodcutting</p>\n<p>run into trees until they fall over, get wood</p>\n<p>Carpentry</p>\n<p>upgrade any area, will require wood, possibly monster drops or items</p>\n<p>Atheletics</p>\n<p>move faster between areas. swim, climb, jump, tiptoe to new areas</p>\n<p>Thieving</p>\n<p>pick locks, steal from enemies, better loot rolls on chests</p>\n<p>Magic</p>\n<p>transmute materials into new materials, add status effects to your attacks, conjure gold, whatever</p>\n<p>Network Multiplayer</p>\n<p>bottom left area will be chatbox</p>\n<p>item market - buy/sell resources for gems or gold - With no real equipment or tools, this is doubtful</p>\n<p>party dungeons - join up with friends to take down a dungeon</p>\n<p>friends can visit town, encounters in field, will give positive events</p>\n<p>with no map movement, and the small screen space, it's hard to think of what to add, but i do think multiplayer helps this sort of game immensely. This is a very far-off idea, probably best kept for a sequel with a larger game screen, if the reception for this game is well-recieved enough.</p>\n<p>Closing:</p>\n<p> I think I've covered everything here!
