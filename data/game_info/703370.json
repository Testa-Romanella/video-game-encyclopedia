It's a game which will help you break the ice in a fun way.</p>\n<p>You start the game by rolling the dice and then a card is shown and whatever question is shown you have to ask your partner/friend, there are some tasks and some questions. Once you've done that, click on the card so it closes and the next player can roll the dice.</p>\n<p>First one to reach the last tile is the winner!</p>\n<p>Credits -\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @tyekillough for the in-game bgm.Thanks to @maaot for the in-game graphics.
