To keep the brain from forgetting the memory it has to be kept alive in at least 2 areas of the brain at the same time. Your goal is to get to the ripe old age of a hundred without forgetting this precious memory. <br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/>W, D - walk<br/>LEFT MOUSE - shoot<br/>SPACE - jump<br/>E - heal a nearby memory (press multiple times)<br/><br/>You can use the minimap to transport to other areas of the brain. <br/><br/><br/>I know this build is quite buggy and unfinished and I still want to add powerups, animation, tutorial etc. But I had some problems with getting a build done at all. So I'm happy I have at least something to show :)<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:00:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5be/5be097bef1df140a5cc49f81e48fdf47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ninsky"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
