This being a recreation project I aim to model the console room accurately to the set used in the TV show. I think reference is key to any project, I don\u2019t think you can ever do to much, especially for this project. I wouldn\u2019t have had the idea and picked to do it if there was just to little image reference of it.</p>\n<p>I only had time to work on this for\u00a03 weeks. I worked a lot on the models, but I ran out of time to texture and light the scene properly in Unreal to the quality I wanted.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I wish I had more time to spend on this and will continue working on it over the summer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T03:58:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df70c8df57e1c408639d3294b0f56b46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheGreatGeneral"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
