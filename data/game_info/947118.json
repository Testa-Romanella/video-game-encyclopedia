{"id": 947118, "slug": "terrapin", "name": "Terrapin", "name_original": "Terrapin", "description": "<p>This game was made for the \"Mini-Jam 128: Health\" 3-day game jam. I spent about twice as long on it as was given, so I decided just to polish it a little and release it by itself. Love to hear your thoughts and comments! The theme was \"Health,\" with the restriction being \"The only way to go is up\". The former plays into the story and mechanic of health protection, whilst the latter into the climbing of the volcano and the reactor's irrevocable overload bar... Part of the reason I decided to do this jam was to see if I could get a game working on the web. Fingers crossed this works all okay!</p>\n<p><strong>PREMISE</strong></p>\n<p>You are the pilot of a Terrapin. Congratulations! It's your job to drive through hazardous terrain and deliver important cargo to remote outposts.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal is simple: get to your destination, with both you and your cargo in one piece. Power your shields, use your power wisely, and deliver your goods.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left click: Add Power</p>\n<p>Right Click: Reduce Power</p><p>Escape: Quit game (sadly broken atm.)</p>\n<p><strong>MECHANICS</strong></p>\n<p>Your primary job is to juggle the power in your transport to protect yourself from the dangers of the volcano whilst avoiding sending your reactor into overload.</p>\n<p>The Terrapin itself is incredibly hardy, but the cargo you care is not. Nor are you, if you decide to save power on your personal shields...</p>\n<p>To avoid damage to the contents of the Terrapin, add varying levels of power to your shields. Doing so will add bars to your reactor, as will reducing power remove them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You will always have a base level of 5 bars to work with from the auxiliary\u00a0battery (even if you lose your reactor), but once you start going over that limit your reactor will start to overload. Once it reaches a threshold, it will explode.</p>\n<p>Your buttons, from left to right (unhelpfully unlabelled in most cases):</p>\n<p><em>Jettison:</em> If the reactor threatens to explode, and you don't trust your power-management skills to avoid making a mistake, press this button to add prematurely lose your reactor. No explosion, no internal damage.</p>\n<p><em>Kinetics Shields: </em>Defends against heavy impacts.</p>\n<p><em>Heat Shields: </em>Protects against intense heat.</p>\n<p><em>Pilot Shields: </em>All-purpose protection for only the pilot.</p>\n<p><em>Engines: </em>Increases speed.</p>\n<p><em>Eject: </em>For if the situation gets too hairy, there is always this escape.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>CHEATSHEET</strong></p>\n<p>The specific values required to avoid taking damage. Read on if you'd prefer to know rather than learn it the hard way:</p>\n<p>Stonerain: 1 Kinetic</p>\n<p>Rocks (both kinds): 2 Kinetic</p>\n<p>Lavarain: 1 Heat</p>\n<p>Lavalake: 2 Heat</p>\n<p>Meteor: 3 Kinetic, 3 Heat</p>\n<p>Crystal Spikes: Only damages if 3 or more power are in Engines. Only ever damages Cargo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T08:14:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea9/ea982e2fa5fd3781ea837b6a88d8fd3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lushmoss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
