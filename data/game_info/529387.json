She must walk through levels defeating enemies, overcoming challenges and destroying obstacles by using her elemental powers.</p>\n\n<p>THE STORY</p><p>The girl scout Jezebel was traveling with other girl scouts when, after an event, she saw herself lost in a forest of a magical world where she started to be followed by a mystical entity called Ifauna. In search of answers and in possession of her yo-yo, the girl decided to venture to find her friends and get out if that place infested by elemental monster, such as fire insects.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>THE GAMEPLAY</p><p>The player will count on Jezebel's yo-yo to imobilize the enemies or to destroy crystals to collect gems with the power of four elements: plant, fire, water and earth.
