It's the second step of the Laika project where the URSS sent the homonymous dog to space. You'll need to avoid enemies, solvepuzzles and dodge deadly traps along the way, in a beautiful and suggestive environment mixed with an appealing graphic. You'll need to push yourself to the limit if you want to get to the end of your mission...alive. Everything wants to kill you, everyone wants to kill, because there are things that should never be let out of their box. Move silently to uncover all the mysteries of the Ogdoade in an extremely complex story. Just when you feel you are close to the solution everything will start looking strange, only to find yourself in an even deeper slump. Do you have what it takes to defeat the terrorists of the Ogdoade? Will you be able?</p><p>Facebook page:</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/laika2.0?fref=ts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d6/3d6ae27d3654f9641b9b2b137aa89c4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
