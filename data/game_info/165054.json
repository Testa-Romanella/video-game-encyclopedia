Their goal is to get to outer space, but given their random nature they'll most likely fail.<br/><br/>After they all die, or 15 seconds have elapsed, they are all used to create a new generation of rockets using a genetic algorithm. The best rockets from the preceding generation are kept, a mutation of the top one is made, a completely new rocket is randomly created, and the rest of them are all using the previous generation as parents to create new designs. As this goes on across generations, a rocket that will ascend all the way into space should eventually appear.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f7/0f71b083f93c55e6ea0e4f8097f675c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mars"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
