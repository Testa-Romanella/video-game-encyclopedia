As a private investigator, you are thinking back on events of a case you have just broke. You recall being approached by a widow to investigate a mysteriously abandoned building owned by a confidential organization. According to the widow, a horrendous accident in the late 60's caused the building to be evacuated and later covered up. Beginning with your entrance into the large, dilapidated building, you slowly descend floor after floor, discovering an extensive headquarters that looks as though it were abandoned overnight. What you believed to be just a classified Cold War era intelligence agency quickly turns foul when you discover the aftermath of numerous encounters with paranormal and non terrestrial objects that were thought to be only myths. Back in your office, you attempt to piece together what happened at Building 37.</p><p>Building 37 is being developed by a group of dedicated seniors at the University of Wisconsin-Stout as part of our senior capstone project.
