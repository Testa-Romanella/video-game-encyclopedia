Score a lot of points in space!\u00a0Did I mention its in space?!</p>\n<p>This is a simple clone of the classic Galaga game (please don't sue me, its all in good fun and practice) that I spent very little time putting together.</p>\n<p>Face endless hordes of enemy ships and attempt to rack up\u00a0 a high score all the while dodging a lot of enemy lasers. Be careful though, your ship has no shields and will in all likelihood explode on contact of anything, which will send you cascading into the deep dark abyss of space.
