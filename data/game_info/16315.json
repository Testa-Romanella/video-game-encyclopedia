Participating players take turns dropping colored discs from the top of the screen into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. The game includes 4 levels of difficulty in single-player mode, a 2-player mode and even comes with a unique 3- and 4-player mode using multi-sided grids. Your winning row can now wrap around the sides in 3D! This is a great way to play with family or a group of friends taking the experience to brand new levels.KEY FEATURES<ul><li>Classic Four-In-A-Row reinvented<br/></li><li>Beautiful 3D graphics and effects<br/></li><li>Wonderful audio and music<br/></li><li>Single-player mode with 4 levels of difficulty<br/></li><li>Local turn-based 2-player mode<br/></li><li>Local turn-based 3- and 4-player modes on multi-sided grids</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T14:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07a3cc7f8d9515b628e93c077d1bebd8.jpg", "website": "http://www.ensenasoft.com", "rating": 1.8, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 331, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EnsenaSoft"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["EnsenaSoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
