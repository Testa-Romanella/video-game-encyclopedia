Unlike traditional combat games, the win condition in Brawljection is not to\u00a0directly hit the other player\u00a0but to lure them into harmful hazards spreaded across the map. Players have the ability to punch, dash and to\u00a0grab and throw the other player.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\n<br/><strong>Keyboard 1</strong><strong>Keyboard 2</strong><strong>Controller</strong><strong>Movement</strong>WASDArrow KeysD-Pad<strong>Jump</strong>SpaceRight CtrlButton East<strong>Dash</strong>Left ShiftILeft/Right Trigger<strong>Punch</strong>CRight ShiftButton West<strong>Grab</strong>VPLeft/Right Shoulder<strong>Rotate Cube</strong>QOButton North", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T10:10:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba3/ba33250a5171fbc4e8b9c27e52fd4610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["b_idle_games"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
