I also made it in two days so it's a very binary game!<br/></p>\n<p>This game works like a Game Boy game. Here are the controls:</p>\n<p>D-pad= WASD/Arrows<br/>A = Alt / Z / J <br/>Start - Enter <br/></p><p>It is more of a visual-novel style experience than a game. You can think of this as something that I would have done as a short comic if I had time. I am pretty happy with it artistically but I think that some people might not enjoy the fact that player agency is reduced as part of the narrative. For me this is the main reason that it is interesting but I know that I have sort of eccentric taste.</p><p>The following songs appear in the game and are credited to kr\u00fcmel (crumb)#0723 and used under the MIT license.</p>\n<p>Sneaking Around- Main Song<br/>Radical Victory- Overnight Jingle<br/>Determined- Morning music<br/>Short Hauntings- Office Music<br/>Slow Death- Board Room Music</p><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:55:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf9d0c12bcc3d100e4efad78cbc58a65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenJelter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
