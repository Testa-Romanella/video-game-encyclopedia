I\u00a0won't concentrate on graphic, coding or options as I am not the author of this game and don't claim any rights or anything; I\u00a0wanted only to add alternatives in the battle vs the ghost. You cannot lose in the game. It's just to past time and entertain people.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Once you enter the battle scene, move with the arrows, then press ctrl to place your character. Press space to switch character. With\u00a0the other character, place the trap first by pressing ctrl and ctrl again to place him. Press ctrl to activate your stream on/off and space to change character. Once your stream is activated, you can change its angle by pressing up or down arrow. Press T to activate the trap. Careful to not cross the stream, it's poorly coded. The ghost weakens when touching the stream then it gets into a capture stream; move carefuly to not lose the ghost. The ghost is afraid of the stream; if it stays away, switch it off or use the other character to reach it.\u00a0Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:29:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a4/8a4fcbe018935bd904bc39df57abe72b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelItchio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
