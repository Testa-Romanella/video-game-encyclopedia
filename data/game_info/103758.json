There's no friendly-fire between members from the same group.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Espol.io has only two commands: \"Directional Axis\" and a \"Shoot Button\".</p>\n<p>You can play it using the keyboard, a joystick or a virtual joystick in case you're on a tablet.</p>\n<p>On a keyboard, you can move with\u00a0the Arrow Keys or WASD Key, and shoot with the Space Bar. You can also press' to open the Message Menu and press a number to send a message.</p>\n<p>On a tablet, you shall activate the virtual joystick by touching the left and the right side of the screen. Left side activates the directional axis and right side shoots.</p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>As soon as you join the game, collect all\u00a0<em>esp\u00f3lios</em>\u00a0you can find. You'll see your name ranking up.</p>\n<p>If you get damaged in combat, look for a mothership in the map. Hovering the mothership will get you repaired at the cost of some\u00a0<em>esp\u00f3lios</em>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8ba4cea23d8249f2ef2f4b7c21024a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Felladrin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
