As of now, the game can offer complete playable gameplay with two players competing each other in a match to plant tree, water it, and collect its fruits for score. Who gets higher score within match's limited time wins!</p>\n<p>See Code? section below if you want to see the code.</p>\n<p><strong>BEWARE:\u00a0</strong>The game needs two XBox360 controllers to play in case of two players, or one controller in case you play alone (but the game is aimed for 2 players).
