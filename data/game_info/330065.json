Abuse the game's glitches in order to win a game that may feel unwinnable.</p><p>Keys used:\u00a0space/enter, arrow keys</p><p>Press the cheese in the upper right corner to pause the game</p><p>Godot Engine v3.1.beta7.official<br/></p><p>Don't read this if you don't want\u00a0 ANY hints on levels--------------------------</p><p>General hints:\u00a0</p><p>If you die enough times on a level, it will give you hints (except on the many cheeses level. That was just a mistake)</p><p>There are certain walls you can pass through and certain floor tiles you can't pass through</p><p>Teleporters are the key to victory on several levels</p><p>There's a pause-button glitch on one of the levels. Even if you time out, try pressing the pause button</p><p>Hint on the many cheeses level: Your cheese location is determined by the name you gave in the beginning (name is turned into ascii values in an array, added up, then modded by 62 to get location).\u00a0 It will always be in the same location if you kept the same name. So basically, don't retry a section of cheese if you've already tried them and timed out on that level.</p><p>The 'choose the right potion' level is an homage to The Giant's Drink from Ender's Game, and this info may help you beat this level.
