All elements are subject to change. Many sprites and sound effects are still placeholders.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Aeon Zenith is a high speed, high aggression bullet hell shooter with a dark fantasy setting. Use your unique suite of weapons to destroy your demonic enemies as fast as possible. The greater your speed and efficiency, the more foes will appear. This functions as both an adaptive difficulty system, and a scoring system, since every enemy that appears increases your rank.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see my original release page here. I highly recommend reading the tutorial here for more information on the game system, before playing.</p>\n\n<p>You can find updates on my twitter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0af/0af08afaddece9817d79830d861b72db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squire Grooktook"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
