I uploaded it here just in case you are curious. There are 3 characters;\u00a0 Andrew, flip, kop. If Andrew comes to the door, just close it. If flip starts to appear on the window, shine the light on him. If Kop appears close to the vent, close it. There is a power and air meter.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also it was made in under 12 hours in total so don't expect much.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:59:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bba8fc64cdecb943a11418b400468d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xarisGames21"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
