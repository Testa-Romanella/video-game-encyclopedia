Closely Guarded by a faceless menace, a large crack in the sky slowly consumes the land. In towns like Old Meta, the inhabitants drink and gamble away their final days waiting for the end to come. Precious few hold on to a hope that the Jengo, an outlander destined to avert this crisis, will hurry up and get on with the job of saving the world...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMeanwhile, in a completely different world, a disgruntled gaming prodigy called Jeff seeks a new challenge. He heads off to the local Game Mart seeking his destiny. What he doesn't know yet is that two worlds are about to collide.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTonight, Jeff must postpone the Apocalypse!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nJengo is an old school point and click adventure game inspired by the golden era of the genre.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n \u201cWell... There\u2019s this fella that\u2019s into games, so into games that he brushes Contra aside without losing a life, knows exactly where the secret passages are and where the loot is stashed without even phoning a hint line. A man from another time. A time before every gamer tried to be a streamer, a forum troll know-it-all or indie developer... A time when gaming was about gaming... This is a story about an old school gamer lost in modern times. His name is Jeff.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nElsewhere, beyond the realm of the real world, is a lonely place at the edge of the Pixelverse called \u2018Old Meta\u2019. A dumping ground for the Nobody-folk who were almost somebody - but have long lost their dreams at a drinking hole in the middle of the desert. Little did they know is that all they needed was a hero... Sadly, considering the nature of forgotten places, no such hero ever came by, so they\u2019ll have to settle on a gamer instead.\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db3/db3708aafa484b26ae4521ae53d506d6.jpg", "website": "http://www.robot-wizard.com/default.aspx", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 465, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robot Wizard"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Playdius"], "esrb_rating": null}
