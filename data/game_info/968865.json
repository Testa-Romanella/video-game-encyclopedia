It simulates a MMORPG and many mechanics are based around a MMO design. This game may primarily appeal to those looking for nostalgia of old MMOs or RPGs from the early 2000s or before.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNot everything is clearly outlined or explained, so many things must be discovered or explored by the player. I want to leave you with little guidance so that you can find the content entirely on your own, in a similar way that I experienced when I tried to tackle complex games without instructions in the past. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main things you should know are the following: <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo save your content, you must return to or be in the Town location and click the Save and Logout button. This is the only thing that will save your progress, including your characters data and all items.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce you get into the main game, you can press Escape from the Town location to adjust volume, graphic settings and view basic controls.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLastly, there is hidden content in this game, I hope you get to uncover your own from your unique path of play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T20:56:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f91/f917104f4d6d9773259694a08d11dbda.jpg", "website": "https://www.lostguardian.games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lost Guardian Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Lost Guardian Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
