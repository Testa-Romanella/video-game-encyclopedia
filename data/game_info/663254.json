Run around, pick up items and bombs in either a deathmatch, or a capture-the-teddy mode.</p>\n<p>It's in PICO 8 - so use Pico 8 controls. Controller should be supported too. In pico-8 terms, X is bomb, or shoot. Down picks up an item</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.</strong> AI is mediocre - best at two players. It is still possible to get stuck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T06:59:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aec/aec400750725447aaff4568c008a7106.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lachlan Kingsford"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
