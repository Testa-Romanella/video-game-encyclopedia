They are like little inner monsters that we have to deal with.<br/>Let's play to get to know some of them better.<br/><br/>A feeling doesn't come alone. It can come mixed with several others, and it manifests itself more strongly depending on the situation.<br/>So we chose a set of feelings to show this relationship. <br/>We've created several little monsters to represent a variety of feelings (or emotions).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each card represents a different little inner monster. There are 36 in total.<br/>Each card has 6 auxiliary feelings - Joy, Anger, Will, Disgust, Altruism, Fear - with values representing their affinity with the main feeling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The objective of a match is to accumulate all the cards for yourself until your opponent runs out of cards to play.<br/>In each Set, a player will have 3 cards open.<br/>In the Set, the cards battle one by one with an opponent's card.<br/>The battle consists of comparing the value of a certain auxiliary feeling between the 2 players' cards.<br/>Whoever has the highest value wins that Round.<br/>Whoever wins the best-of-3 Rounds gets the 6 cards of the Set.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are 6 Arenas in the game - they represent different environments we live in - Happy, Sad, Tumultuous, Calm, Dark and Heavenly. An environment moves our little monsters for better or worse. Each little monster has an environment that favors it, an arena in which it will grow stronger.<br/>In your turn, choose the Arena that best fits your strategy.<br/>Oh, each Arena has its own background music to get you in the mood\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/>Play Rock-Paper-Scissors (Jo-ken-po) to dispute who starts the match choosing the arena and the auxiliary feeling for the first Set.<h3>Strategy against Sana</h3><br/>Sana is your companion to dispute the single-player matches.
