What secrets could this cave hold?</p>\n<p>Check out the trailer for the game here:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIGaPzWC6JA</p>\n<p>Project Automata has been my first medium sized game project, and has been a huge undertaking for me. Over the last year I've developed it from being boxes jumping around avoiding very angry faces, to what you can see in the screenshots and more above. Its been a huge project, and I hope you enjoy it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you would like to support my game development, please feel free to donate, but don't feel obligated to. Donations will help support my game development in the future. \u00a0Any feedback is also appreciated, please do so here , or by following the link in game. Otherwise, if you would like to contact me directly, this is the twitter for the game:\u00a0https://twitter.com/GamesVentus.</p>\n<p>Please note, currently the game only supports controllers. Xbox controllers work natively, and button layouts can be adjusted in the launcher before the game starts. PS4 controllers work with the use of programs such as DS4 windows. I do not think this game should be played with a keyboard and mouse, so I will likely not be adding that in the future unless heavily requested. This game is considered done, but I will be doing a few fixes to it as people play it.</p>\n<p>I also released Anne as a character in the game Rivals of Aether. If you own that game check her out here.</p>\n<p>People who helped make this possible:</p>\n<p>Disco Reptile - Main character Sprite work</p>\n<p>https://www.discoreptile.net/</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/DiscoReptile</p>\n<p>Cipcal_\u00a0 -\u00a0Icon/Character Art</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/cipcal_/</p>\n<p>Jordan Seward -\u00a0Tile Sets</p>\n<p>Brandon George, and\u00a0 Jason Sosnowski-\u00a0Music</p>\n<p>soundcloud.com/suszaddy<br/></p>\n<p>Final boss music by DM Dokuro</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6-OiaulQM8w6EAYaCNpoGg<br/></p>\n<p>Brandon George - Trailer</p>\n<p>If anyone listed above\u00a0wants me to make changes, let me know and I will do my best to do so.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T04:35:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2f/e2f179bbe96683d5981fd64892529ff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyanVentus"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
