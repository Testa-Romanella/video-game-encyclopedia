You have to see it to believe it; with its offbeat controls, inventory items that kill you, and intentional misspellings, it's the weirdest thing since sliced bread!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMETA is based on Adventure Game Studio, the platform for most of our games, and is runner-up for two AGS Awards.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c6/3c61594bec5f7ba446b773082225e9c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Crystal Shard"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
