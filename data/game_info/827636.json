Gather resources on Earth and prepare to colonize the Moon. From there you will expand into the solar system and eventually other systems. Discover more resources and harness their power to improve your transportation network's efficiency.</p>\n<p>A lot of my ideas are still in flux and I am looking for feedback, feel free to chat with me on Discord!<br/><br/>The game is hot off the press, so there may be plenty of bugs, I will try to work diligently to squash them as soon as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>Dust to Dust is currently a work in progress (early access). The free browser (demo) version is the <strong>SAME </strong>as the paid downloadable version at the moment (mostly as a go support me). The plan is to add more content to the paid only version. Bug fixes, polish, and early game refinement will be added to the demo, but content wise the demo is finished. If a lot of additional content gets added to the paid version the price may go up (but that is a ways off).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T12:33:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f8a8b516378432bb5ff1c034e85a4b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["MaleMaldives"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
