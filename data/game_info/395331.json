{"id": 395331, "slug": "pyrrhuss-last-stand", "name": "Pyrrhus's Last Stand", "name_original": "Pyrrhus's Last Stand", "description": "<p>Welcome to my entry for GitHub GameOff 2019!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can find the repo here:\u00a0https://github.com/tdetoy/GameOff2019</p>\n<p>As the theme was\u00a0<strong>Leaps and Bounds</strong>, I\u00a0decided to interpret it a little more literally. Your only ability (both defensively and offensively) are short range warp jumps (leaps) that you can use. Reposition yourself to avoid shots, or jump through the exposed shield generators on the capital ships to down them! Just make sure to stay within the bounds of the battlefield, don't let too many escape, and don't let a frigate jump in on top of you...</p>\n<p>There are a number of things that I think I\u00a0could improve upon given the time, but this is about as complete as it's going to get on time. There are some known issues (it would be better if frigates did not overlap, I'd like to add more effects, sometimes frigates will leave and go OOB making you take damage to get them, otherwise letting them escape), and I\u00a0would have preferred to implement more control schemes. As it stands though, mouse and keyboard is necessary, though you can initiate jump aiming with Shift to make it a little easier for those who cannot left and right click simultaneously.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Intro</strong><strong>:</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p><em>For a few years now, you've been the sole test pilot on the outskirts of Federation space, testing a revolutionary new fighter equipped with a jump drive. It's surprisingly boring, but safe, living. That is, until the Commonwealth happens upon your testing grounds during their push deeper into the Federation. The outpost has no defenses and the top brass is not interested in actually getting into a ship that goes\u00a0</em>toward<em> the enemy, but somebody has to delay the Commonwealth fleet.\u00a0</em><em>That means it's up to you!</em></p>\n<p><em>... Unfortunately, the engineers haven't yet installed weapons on it. That means you have one option - jump wakes tend to be fairly fatal to anybody caught in them.</em></p>\n<p><em>The jump interdictors are set up - Commonwealth frigates should be dropping out of warp at any moment in your vicinity. You're going to keep as many from escaping as you can, for as long as you can. The brass promised to remember you, though you're not sure how much they mean it.</em></p>\n<p><em>The designers called this ship \"Prototype JF-4P,\" but that won't do. Thinking about the task ahead, you pat the console and a small grin plays on your lips.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Well, the \"Pyrrhus\" seems appropriate.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T02:23:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1ebe0491658af0f9f47d9a97d935d74d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["twobitadder"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
