Now he must rampage through the land, using his unique spin ability to crash and bash through every obstacle to get back his mojo (pit)!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpin, jump, and smash your way through dozens of tricky old-school platforming levels. Bop through hordes of enemies and tackle complex and sometimes ridiculous jumping and spinning challenges with all the grace of a ball in a pinball machine. Each level has unique gimmicks and mechanics, to challenge even seasoned platform players. Starring a cast of cute voxel fruits and vegetables, this game is fast, fun and occasionally hilarious!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T03:51:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a2/1a2511120b1c81655355cdf980613edf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lierinwait"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Lierinwait Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
