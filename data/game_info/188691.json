Powers are generated with varying power levels to always give a fresh combination and countless possibilities.</li><li>Artificial intelligence for computer-controlled enemies with powers. This includes dynamic pathfinding (for example, walking around pools of acid and using portals to reach different places)</li><li>Name-generating subsystem, to randomly create fitting names for superpowered characters. This system is also uploaded separately as a file, here (including the simplified \"Power DNA\" system)</li><li>Field of vision, map chunks to enable an infinite game map, functioning UI menus.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60a465a82a39dc7a04d106ce26827487.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["shemetz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
