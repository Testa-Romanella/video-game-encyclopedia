And damn, it even gets children...<br/></p>\n<p>To collect pollen, fly to a flower and hit and hold space (it gets stucked sometimes, just try again or try another flower). Planting a seed with right click costs 30 pollen. Gameover when there are no flowers left on the little meadow. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T07:56:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6eb866aa606a78d7dab3d1b31eac5221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alexvwegen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
