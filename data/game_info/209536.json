The game is infinite, there is no <br/>ending, to beat each level the player will need to get to the end-level <br/>boss and beat him, also the game features a in-game shop, killing the <br/>opponents will make the points counter increase, at the end of the <br/>level, the points will be converted into money allowing to purchase more<br/> effective equipment like double fire, rotating blades, frag bombs, <br/>missiles and shield with a timer. Equipments are expensive so the player<br/> will need to kill a lot of enemies to raise enough money necessary to <br/>purchase additional equipments that are quite expensive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/995/9950201bf4417511b7a9e2a0ac622bcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndieGameDev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
