Better be quick, because the tide is rolling in and will turn a fortress to rubble with a single wave.</p>\n<p>No one can truly stop the wrath of the sea, so see how long you can keep the party going before the waves drown everyone's fun. Or if the pressure's too much, turn on casual mode to keep the beach undisturbed, building to your heart's content. You can try to save the beach bums lying around, but it'll only prolong the inevitable. Besides, their music is turned up so loud they probably won't notice you helped. That reminds me, all these music-making gizmos mean dipping even your pinky toe in the sea will get you <em>zapp</em><em>ed</em>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the party!</p>\n\n<ul><li>Controls\r\n<ul><li>Move - WASD/Arrow Keys\r\n</li><li>Hop - Space\r\n</li><li>Dig sand - LMB\r\n</li><li>Deposit sand - RMB\r\n</li><li>Dump all sand - MMB/E\r\n</li><li>Switch camera view - Q\r\n</li><li>Restart - R\r\n</li><li>Quit - Escape\r\n</li><li>Casual mode - C\r\n</li><li>Bop/Dance - B (Coming soon)</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Assets<ul><li>\"Coconut House\" font by Joe Letter</li></ul><ul><li>\"Procedural Terrain Tutorial in Unity\" by Brackeys<ul><li>Thanks pal, couldn't have done it without you</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p>[Made for\u00a0Minijam 108]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T20:14:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44b/44bf603277dcaffc996c6c5c5b2476d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kambopoloid"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
