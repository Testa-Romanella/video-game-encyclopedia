The same configuration repeats every 4 steps.\r\n</li><li><strong>Doors</strong>: a door placed in a 1-tile pathway limits the number of possible configurations to pass through it to 2.\r\n</li><li><strong>Trapdoors</strong>: a trapdoor in a 1-tile pathway reduces the number of possible configurations to pass through it in 1 when.\r\n</li><li><strong>Doors and trapdoors</strong>: when well-placed in 1-tile pathways, a trapdoor followed by a door reduces the possible configurations to pass through them to 1.\r\n</li><li><strong>2x2 spaces</strong>: rolling around in a 2x2 square allows you to select among three different configurations.\r\n</li><li><strong>2x2 spaces</strong>: rolling the dice clockwise switches through configurations in the opposite order as going counterclockwise.\r\n</li><li><strong>3x2 spaces</strong>: rolling in a 3x2 rectangle allows switching among 12 different configurations.\r\n</li><li><strong>Open areas</strong>: without using turning arrows, the maximum possible configurations are 12.
