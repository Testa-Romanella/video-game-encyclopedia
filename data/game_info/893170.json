Lunar Vengeance is an infinite-runner game, where you play as the \"Lunar Owl\" (aka fake boomkin via WoW). As the owl, you are running through forests trying to find an answer to your question - who is destroying the habitat!?</p>\n<p>Currently game has only one game mode and it is Infinite, but in the future I plan on adding Storyline mode, \"Fly\" mode, \"Driving\" mode and a totally different approach on player vs enemy.</p>\n<p>Since this is a very early build, expect bugs, flying objects, missing collisions, and possibly more. Please let me know of them in the comments, as well as your thoughts about the gameplay &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T05:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/288/2887278d2878808d6a186630186c7836.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ISIK Dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
