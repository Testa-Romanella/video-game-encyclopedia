Let's say a Doom like with 2D bomberman fashion, or a Bomberman without bombs but with guns and flamethrower.</p>\n<p>It's was initially designed in the\u00a0computer room\u00a0of my\u00a0high school\u00a0on\u00a0PC MS/DOS\u00a0and written in\u00a0Pascal\u00a0and inline\u00a0x86 assembly. I got help from friends as Guillaume, Donatien and Aur\u00e9lien.\r\n</p>\n<p>It was initially created in\u00a01996/1997, so you can feel the\u00a0action movie legacy\u00a0of the 80's and early 90's with all Arnold Schwarzenegger, Silvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Kurt Russel, Steven Seagal. The new title screen and the music were chosen to highlight this legacy. In 1996, it was\u00a0unconscious\u00a0as it was one of the main pop culture of the last 15 years, reworking on this in 2022, I make it more \"meta\" and more like a\u00a0parody.\r\n</p>\n<p>This version is a port to\u00a0Amiga\u00a0created for the\u00a0Amiga Blitz Basic Game Jam.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you'll get a little fun with this game.</p>\r\nGame Hightlights\r\n<ul><li>Compatible with all\u00a0Amiga\u00a0with 1 Mb of chip (Tested on CDTV, Amiga 500, Amiga 1200 and CDTV).\r\n</li><li>up to\u00a04 players\u00a0using a parallel port to joysticks adapter for player 3 &amp; 4.\r\n</li><li>missing player are replaced by (not very smart)\u00a0bots.\r\n</li><li>4\u00a0different\u00a0avatars/fighters (almost Rambo, almost Clint Eastwood, almost Frankenstein, almost an american soldier).\r\n</li><li>4 world\u00a0themes.\r\n</li><li>7 levels\u00a0to make the difference.\r\n</li><li>3\u00a0game\u00a0modes.\r\n</li><li>7\u00a0types of\u00a0Bonus.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>4 players can fight in the same time using joystick or joypad using the two DB9/Joystick port of your Amiga.
