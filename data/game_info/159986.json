These issues are\u00a0especially prevalent in Chrome. Firefox has better audio performance of the web browsers, but Android is the most reliable in this aspect.</p>\n<p><strong>-------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>Deja Vu (In development) is a 2D Self-Cooperative puzzle platformer. You must run through the same level multiple times, solving little puzzles to remove obstacles in your way\u00a0in order to collect all of the coins. During each iteration, your actions will be recorded, so you must remember what you did in the past as to not repeat and waste movements.x works a little bit better, but Android has the best audio performance right now.</p>\n<p>This demo is just a prototype/proof-of-concept. All of the assets use free assets from opengameart.org,\u00a0itch.io, and the Unity asset store. I have an extremely different thematic view for the potential\u00a0final game.</p>\n<p>Please read more on my this game and my other games and projects on my website, or feel free to email me as sprimate@gmail.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9b/b9b636ed4138c91960af9f223fe23dac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Priyal Seebadri"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
