{"id": 1225, "slug": "warhammer-end-times-vermintide", "name": "Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide", "name_original": "Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide", "description": "<p>This multiplayer-only game based on the popular Warhammer Fantasy franchise is set in the End Time era of this setting. The plot is centered around the city of Ubersreik that was recently taken over by a horde of rat-like monsters called Skavens. The players, who can team up in groups of up to four, are tasked with cleaning the streets from the dirty invaders. There are thirteen levels with different objectives, some of which involve collecting certain items or protecting a city well from being poisoned.<br />\nThe gameplay is strongly reminiscent of that in Left 4 Dead series, in which the protagonists have to slaughter monsters coming in large numbers, using both melee and ranged weapons. There are five character classes, each with its unique specialization: the Dwarf Ranger and the Empire Soldier are strong and slow, the Witch Hunter and the Waywatcher are the fast scouts, and the Bright Wizard uses magic. On the levels, the players can find item perks that either restore health or ammo or buff the character. It is essential to fairly distribute the perks across the party, especially since every player can only have one perk in each category at a time.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2015-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T01:20:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1dc/1dc45435c09f844b24eb96cd66eb6325.jpg", "website": "http://www.vermintide.com", "rating": 3.48, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 161, "owned": 3263, "beaten": 142, "toplay": 36, "dropped": 235, "playing": 19}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 249, "ratings_count": 431, "suggestions_count": 668, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 436, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Fatshark"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fatshark"], "esrb_rating": null}
