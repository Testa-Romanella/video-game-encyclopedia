Level up your character (no pun intended) and make your way down through the floors that become progressively harder and harder.\u00a0Combining early 90's first person shooters and oldschool text-based rougelikes, <strong>Asciipocalypse</strong> presents it's eerie 3d environment, writing it\u00a0out on your screen using ascii characters and nothing more.</p>\n<p>This game started as an educational project and was developed over the course of one month. I plan to keep working on it (as long as I'll find time to do so :) ), to improve the game's replay value and to make overall experience more diverse. Any suggestions for new content/improvements, as well as bug/performance issues reports are very welcome.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that whole rendering is done on CPU. In case of game's performance dropping, consider playing on lower screen resolution.</p>\r\nSource code\r\n<p>The source code is available on my Github page under an MIT license.
