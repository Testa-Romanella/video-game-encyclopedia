He said \"You will serve as my scary gas indicator\".</p>\n<p>Guess what hooman, Suck my indicator!\u00a0I'm getting out alive!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I did not have a lot of time to explain the game before the time ran out, so please read below. Also if you are struggling and just want to test the boss you can press <strong>\"K\"\u00a0</strong>skip directly to the bossfight.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>The game is played in 2 stages. In the first stage you with the use of dynamite dig out the mine in a hunt to find 3 pentagram parts, these are needed to spawn the boss. But its not that easy, hidden behind the rock walls are enemy spawners, when their block has been dug out these will spawn enemies every round. Not only that, the min is also very unstable, the more damage you take each round the more of the mine will collapse! The last enemy you kill each round will point you towards the with the same color.</p>\n<p>Once you have managed to connect all shards to the pentagram the boss will spawn!</p>\n<p>And as you may have guessed, defeating it is step 2.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WSAD : move</p>\n<p>SPACE: dodge</p>\n<p>LMB: sing (attack)</p>\n<p>LMB: alt song (alt attack)</p>\n<p>E: reload<br/></p>\n<p>(cheat) K: Skip directly to the bossfight</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T16:49:57", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HanYolo666"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
