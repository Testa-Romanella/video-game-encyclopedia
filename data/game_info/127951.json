The game\r\nwas created from scratch and entirely by me in less than 48 hours.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYour objective is to kill as many monsters as you can. Surviving is actually not\r\nproductive (you lose points for being alive without killing), but will spawn\r\nmore enemies wich give you more and more points.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe whole game revolves around the theme \r\n\t<em>Enemies as Weapons</em>. In Space Recycler\r\nthis becomes apparent by using the rests of dead enemies to kill other enemies.\r\nThere is a single energy bar that lowers when you receive damage, shoot, attract\r\ndebris or have much weight already attracted.\r\n</p>Controls\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u2190\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tTurns the ship counter-clockwise\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u2192\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tTurns the ship clockwise\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u2191\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAdvances the ship\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tV\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tShoots some weak energy\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tC\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tPropels your attracted matter forward\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tX\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAttracts matter nearby or directly in front of you\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tK\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tKills yourself", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b6/1b6276a1657e8ff93a307c31fd39a172.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Daniel Escoz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
