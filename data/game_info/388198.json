The band has one instrument, a windchime.\u00a0Ask the moon to ask the tree to get the band to play the instrument in a different key in a different scale.</p>\n\n<p>[Click the moon in-game to generate a wind chime of a different root note, starting on a different chime tube\u00a0over a different scale]</p>\n<p>The soundscape is entirely procedural--the wind, the chime. The environment is partially procedural--the wind, the falling leaves, the fireflies. Pressing the moon is your only control.</p>\n\n<p>This was made as a birthday card for my partner, Rotem. It took too long to make so it became a belated birthday card. I thought it may be useful to people who use white noise/random ambient noise for whatever purpose, so here it is, for you too.</p>\n<p>This game features fireflies which were a big part of my childhood growing up in the southern US. Unfortunately, firefly populations are in decline around the world. Check out some ways you can reduce your impact on firefly populations locally here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T07:01:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75c87d7906dbf7c60625de8e9d2c83f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brandon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
