{"id": 105415, "slug": "nestling", "name": "NESTLING", "name_original": "NESTLING", "description": "<p><em>Nestling</em>\u00a0is a meditative, ambient game about birdwatching. You walk through a forest, taking in the sights and sounds around you, enjoying a lovely afternoon. Every once in awhile, you'll hear a bird call. You can see the bird, but you can hear it... so you try to coax the bird out of hiding by copying its call by whistling.<br/></p>\n<p>That is to say: you, the player, in real life, try to copy the bird call by whistling, in real life.</p>\n<p>A microphone picks up your whistle, and the game determines whether you copied the birdsong well. The bird sings to you again, and you whistle back again, and this goes on a few more times. If you did it well, the bird happily emerges from its hiding place and hangs with you for a bit -- maybe eating some seeds from your hand, or letting you pet it. You can take a picture of the bird for your collection. Then the bird flies away, and you continue on your walk, listening for more birds.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong>: WASD and mouse to move, E to interact, C to crouch, Spacebar to toggle Photo Mode, \u00a0microphone input.<br/>Microphones are <strong>mandatory</strong> to play this game. Earphones are optional, but strongly recommended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03b/03b7e99c3582eeff9bfc823adddef60b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nestling"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
