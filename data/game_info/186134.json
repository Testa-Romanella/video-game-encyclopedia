The current finished version includes a couple levels where the goal is to match the colored chips to the corresponding block in order to move on to the next level.<br/></p><p><strong>Controls:</strong> A (left movement), D (right movement), W (Magnetic ability), SPACE (jump)<br/></p><p><strong>Developer's statement: </strong>This game is based around an early prototype which was inspired by games like <em>INK</em> by ZackBellGames. The background music is credited to Jason Lewis -with some editing done by me.</p><p>Rather than make a basic platformer or a puzzle game, I wanted to combine the two in some way. I wanted the focus of the game to be on colors. And what started as an attempt to recreate <em>INK</em> mechanics turned into its own idea of color matching. I hope to develop this game further to include an ever growing list of colors and color combinations, but for now simplicity is key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b13565c56248a45ff45a6abe36578fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UntamedArts"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
