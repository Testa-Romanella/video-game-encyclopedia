Game Jam in March 2020.<br/>The theme - \"Minimal Instructions\"<br/>Bearing this in mind - There is not much I want to tell about the game or its controls, etc.<br/>A keyboard and mouse are required.<br/><br/><strong>PLAY YOUR OWN MUSIC IN-GAME (.wav Only)</strong><br/>There is a \"Music\" folder in the game's \"SpaceChill_Data\" Folder. You can add your own .wav tracks (ONLY .wav works) in here and play them in the game by pressing Q on a keyboard. This is additional info I don't count as instructions to play the game. I don't think people would know this feature without being told explicitly and the game doesn't do so.<br/><br/><br/>Attributions to Assets I used :<br/><strong>\"Space Kit\" by Kenney </strong>- https://kenney.nl/assets/space-kit</p>\n<p><strong>\"Walkman Cassete Player\" by TehMerow</strong> - https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/walkman-cassete-player-14daacbaf0f94f458851e15df...<br/><br/><strong>\"'Low Poly Rock Pack\" by Broken Vector</strong> - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-rock-pack-57874<br/><strong><br/>\"Space Skies\" by Pulsar Bytes</strong> - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/spaceskies-free-...</p>\n<p><strong>\"Freelancer Flight Example\" by brihernandez</strong> - https://github.com/brihernandez/FreelancerFlightExample</p>\n<p><strong>\"Without u\" by luvbird </strong>- https://luvbird.bandcamp.com/track/without-u<br/>SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/luvbird<br/><br/><strong>Tracks - \"Distant\" \"On My Way\" and \"Wonder\" by Lakey Inspired</strong><strong> </strong><br/>Official SoundCloud\u00a0\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\r\n<br/>Official\u00a0YouTube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmy8wuTpC95lefU5d1dt2Q<br/>\r\nLicense for commercial use:\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported \"Share Alike\" (CC BY-SA 3.0)\u00a0\r\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode\r\nMusic promoted by:\u00a0Chill Out Records @\u00a0https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ www.ChillOutMedia.com /\u00a0www.LoFi-HipHop.com<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"It's Near\" by DJ Quads</strong><br/>YouTube channel : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCusFqutyfTWRqGhC8kHA5uw <br/>SoundCloud : https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads<br/>Twitter:https://twitter.com/DjQuads<br/>Spotify:\u00a0https://open.spotify.com/artist/2VZrdImbvB03VWApYtBRr3<br/>Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DjQuads<br/>Music released by: Chill Out Records https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ @ www.ChillOutMedia.com / www.LoFi-HipHop.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:43:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03cc7920a9d5beb12db546f471558c54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dhiraj201"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
