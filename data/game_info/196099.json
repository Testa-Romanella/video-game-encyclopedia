It uses similar puzzlemechanics is used for DefragMe in the beginning and thus is called shiftit, like DefragMe was called originally. However tonewise, it goes in a completely different direction, with more character and colours.<br/>The playingfield moves like a sphere projected onto a cylinder. It wraps around horizontally and vertically.</p>\n<p>Since this is a prototype i dont show any story and just want to test the gameplay. Please test this thing and comment about your experience :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97c/97c4fa7a58cc5d38cd67d806531b1feb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ancientpixel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
