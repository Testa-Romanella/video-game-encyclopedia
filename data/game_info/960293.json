Band together with fellow players and brave the dangers of the world of Irumesa, bring dark secrets to light, and experience a living MMO environment brought to life entirely by players!<br/><br/>But be wary - Irumesa is full of danger around every turn. Power-hungry nobles deposed the imperial council and now fight among themselves for power. Vicious beasts lurk in the dark corners of the world. Whispers of an insurrection threaten to unleash a brutal civil war across the known world, giving sinister cults a chance to implement their terrifying designs for the world.<br/><br/>In the middle there's you and your friends. Start your adventure in Edrivine, the crumbling capital of the world, and determine the fate of the world...<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Stats that truly matter: Build the character you desire using a robust character and class system, remembering that each choice and skill mastery is essential to avoiding paths to brutal defeat.<br/></li><li> Teamwork is a must: Work closely with teammates to overcome the dangers of Irumesa. Delve into instanced dungeons, challenge mighty bosses, and solve mysteries of ancient ruins, hidden civilizations, and long-forgotten arcane strongholds - all while keeping each other alive. <br/></li><li> Death is part of the process: Should you fall in battle, you will lose your inventory, but your friends can grab your loot for you, ensuring you can survive to fight another day - that is, as long as they can make it out alive as well.<br/></li><li> Trials and tribulations: Show off your might by taking on 100+ quests, 8+ dungeons, and numerous endgame challenges like raids and world bosses.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> High risk gameplay: The bigger the challenge, the greater the spoils. High level crafting materials and blueprints can unlock quality gear or loot uniquely tied to each character.<br/></li><li> Truly one-of-a-kind loot: These iconic items are limited in quantity. Once they're taken, the only way to get them is to trade, steal, or kill the player holding them.<br/></li><li> Beware the bounty hunters: Killing players is risky business. Each kill will put a bounty on a player\u2019s head, attracting heat from guards, NPC bounty hunters, and other players looking to collect\u2026</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Realms on the verge of war: Chart the peaceful heartland surrounding the capital all the way to the fractious territories at the frayed edges of the empire.<br/></li><li> From the mountains to the seas: Journey across the world, from the fertile, temperate capital. Trek through blistering deserts filled with ruins of old, all the way to the mysterious, snow-covered peaks of forbidden mountains where the fate of the world will be decided.<br/></li><li> Secrets are everywhere: Irumesa is filled with secrets. Explore its cities, forests, deserts, swamps, and more to come across hundreds of stories, people, and of course, iconic loot.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Extensive crafting: Ethyrial isn't just about spilling blood. Supply and support other players as a crafter by creating gear, consumables, and eventually, everything visually seen in the game can be made by hand.<br/></li><li> Meaningful property: There is no instanced housing. Instead, stake claims to property in the overworld that only you can own.<br/></li><li> Express individuality: Would you like a small cabin in the woods? A trading post in a busy spot? A vast guild fortress in a strategic location? Everything and anything is possible for hard working hands.<br/></li><li> Guilds are great: Whether it's just you and a couple of friends or half of a hometown, Ethyrial will support guilds straight out of the box, including public server events, trading, and community ownership of land.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Continuous story: The choices made in the game will have consequences, explored in subsequent expansion packs. Make decisions wisely as they may come back to haunt you in an expansion or two.<br/></li><li> Constantly evolving systems: The game's PVP, arenas, leaderboards, and more will be shaped by the community and their feedback among more yet to be announced modes.<br/></li><li> Persistent updates: Experience large patches and expansions throughout the years, adding new content such as spells, dungeons, quests, and more to ensure you always have a new challenge around every corner.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-14T05:27:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/534/53473c7313afe1de022cef9864b421c9.jpg", "website": "https://www.ethyrialmmo.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 40}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 508, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gellyberry Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freedom Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
