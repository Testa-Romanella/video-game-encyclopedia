You manage one truck, that must deliver several parcels.\u00a0Each time a customer\u00a0is delivered, it\u00a0yields a reward, but using the truck has a cost. Your objective is to maximize your benefits and minimize the time required to deliver all the parcels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game has been realized during the Scientific Game Jam 2023, and it is inspired by a thesis subject about bi-objective optimization. Bi-objective problems deal with the simultaneous optimization of two conflicting objectives.\u00a0Solving such problems\u00a0lead\u00a0to many solutions with different trade-offs for each objective. The game represents how hard it is to\u00a0optimize such a problem.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T14:49:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3c/f3c8bdd6c632ec7f551879ae72603dfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bourlito", "TNtube", "Xantos", "Nelmect", "Jothecat16", "hivt-ulv"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
