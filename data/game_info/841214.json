Its people have memories of things best left as just stories because we all sleep better when things are silly myths. The winter stings your eyes so you can\u2019t see where you\u2019re going, the summer stifles your breath and smothers sound, the woods and sea contain truths you shouldn\u2019t seek and will regret finding. It\u2019s paradise.</p>\n<p>Vacationland was created by David Donnelly of the Fandible Roleplaying Podcast.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T08:45:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab6187fb25019d9acb5f6606c83ed1e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fandible"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
