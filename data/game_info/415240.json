We are a very small - but dedicated! - team and we've been working on it for a couple months now. Although the game is in the alpha stage, we already like where it is going! Having said that, we would really appreciate any feedback you can give us. We want to know what you love, what you hate, what you'd like to see in the future and - of course - what doesn't work :) Since the game is in its early development stage, we are aware it has plenty of bugs, but you should be able to, at the very least, run it. So let us know if you find any trouble while at it!</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for you collaboration and game on!!</p>\n\n<p>Please comment.</p>\n<p>Thx for participate.</p>\n<p>Code\u00a0</p>\n<p>James Chapp Fillmore</p>\n<p>Music</p>\n<p>Santiago Iurissevich</p>\n<p>Game Design</p>\n<p>James Chapp Fillmore &amp; Santiago Iurissevich</p>\n<p>for bugs and feedback comment or send a e-mail to;</p>\n<p>jameschappfillmore@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T02:24:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48cb3b28707d9cacd498fd8cc9ab7970.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamesChappFillmore"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
