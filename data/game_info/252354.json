The ozone layer is being lost, and with it, the hope of human life on Earth. Scientists give an estimate of 15 years for the worst to happen. In addition, as we find ourselves in a very advanced age, our technology has also evolved and we have discovered a similar to our planet to ours which contains a mineral capable of generating ozone. It is our only hope. <br/><br/>In Chronos Salvation, you are one of the people chosen to go to that planet, extract the ore and return to Earth to save it from a terrifying end. The only problem is the time that it takes to go to the planet: 14 years, 11 months and 29 days, so time is running against you.
