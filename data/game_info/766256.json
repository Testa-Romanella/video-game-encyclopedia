From this, we focused on the  theme of Ragnar\u00f6k which is a Norse Myth Event where the world ends. In  initial drafts, we wanted to create separate maps and different enemies  but due to time constraints, it is impossible for such as feat so a  minimalized and working game was created as a result to hand in.\r\n</p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL  NOTE: Credits to the other contributors to this project are found in  the Ludum Dare post which shows all the authors of this page.\u00a0I wish  not to take the majority of the credit for this game and this publish is  merely served as a port to allow you all to test and help us improve  our game creating learning. <br/></p>\n<p>LINK: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/ragnarok-fight-for-the-yggdrasil<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a top-down shooter where the player fights their way  around the map to collect weapon power-ups and defeat enemies. The only lose  condition is when the player dies from enemies OR the time runs out  does the end credits roll.\u00a0As a personal contributor along with fellow  contributors, it is still a WIP but a playable game.\r\n </p>\n<p>I wish to see your feedback on how to improve this game and please do  not hesitate to contact us for any queries or advice on how to complete  our learning. <br/></p>\n<p>Extra note: If you want a proper new level created it will require a full closure of the game and reopen, when restarting while staying in the game, it will only add more rooms to play through rather than re-generating the level, this is an odd problem that may get fixed at a later date.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:03:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba3d08b3f66c3e8ee82dd4815ec21e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neatly Packaged Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
