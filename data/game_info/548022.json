There are four characters available to either play as or to face off against. The aim is to have a higher score than your opponent when the timer hits zero, and to make that a little easier there are bonuses strewn across the table. Some are activated upon touch, while others are stored with the player until used.</p>\n<p>The only two gameplay options are 1 player versus the computer or 2 players versus each other.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T12:52:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/478/478888f874e513cdfa10ae0d8eab2830.jpg", "website": "https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/air-hockey/release-info", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Success"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Mud Duck Productions"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
