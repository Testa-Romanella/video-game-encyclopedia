From the start! So pay close attention to where you step!<br/><br/>Sure, you may be saying \"Pppfffttt, that sounds easy enough! At least there's no time limit!\"... Welp! You Spoke too soon! There will be a time limit. But don't worry though, you will still have plenty of time to plan your steps, just as long as you are hasty!<br/><br/>A goal will be set at the start of a level for you to beat. The more time you have left over when finishing the level, the higher the score. If you beat the level timer for the level, you will unlock the next level!<br/><br/>To move your character around, simply swipe anywhere... That's right! ANYWHERE on the screen to move your character in that direction!<br/><br/>As long as you can reach the exit in time, there shouldn't any problems... Right?!<br/><br/>Good luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56f/56f61f02cd5aeaa586b658d19d6197f6.jpg", "website": "http://www.juicybeetlegames.com.au/slidey-feet.htmlp://", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lindsay Goodridge"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Lindsay Goodridge"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
