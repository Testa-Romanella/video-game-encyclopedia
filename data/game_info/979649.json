Seek out solutions to other dogs' conundrums. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis top-down adventure features an amazing original chip-tune soundtrack of beautiful melodies. You may be tempted to put scrounging around on the back burner, and just listen. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDaugger features no combat, damage, or death. It's a relaxing game that can be enjoyed at any age. Reading is not required, but does enhance the experience. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy this love letter to pets everywhere.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T10:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbd/dbd0b76f75fef45e8d280c3a6986d30f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danny Hance"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Danny Hance"], "esrb_rating": null}
