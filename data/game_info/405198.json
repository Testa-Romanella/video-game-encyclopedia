I had to pare the scope down a lot to get it done on time, but the original version I wanted to have done (a dating sim with a cast of around 8) will be finished by midsummer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiss Me, Monster is a sim about monsters smooching monsters, but it's more than that - it's also heartfelt and sincere, and delves into the kinds of problems these monsters might have in day to day society. Think Monster Prom but with the tone of Interviews with Monster Girls. It's extremely short and I hope competently coded, but I put a lot of work into making it look and feel like a real game even though it's a bit more of a demo than anything else.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T05:02:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/82962fdff8b766572eed16bbd9f33e16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bad kat designs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
