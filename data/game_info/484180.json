Wake up and serve your god!</p>\n<p><strong>My name is Pan, I am the greatest god of herdsmen on Olympus!</strong> My beloved sheep has run away. I want you to lead her to my altar as soon as possible. Do you realize that I am making you an offer which you cannot refuse?\r\n  </p>\n<p>Good. I\u2019ll give you <strong>the instructions</strong>. Are you writing?\r\n  </p>\n<p>Use your staff <em>(left mouse button)</em> to show my sheep the direction. Look around <em>(WASD)</em> and beware: you must notice danger in time and help my sheep to escape.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Yeah, sorry, danger and difficulties definitely will meet you on your way. Other gods always try to stop me from doing my job. <strong>Surely, they will distract you with all sorts of nonsense and will not let you go further until you fulfill their wishes.</strong> There is nothing I can do. Gods are stubborn and easily enraged. Just do what the say and don\u2019t get in trouble, okay?\r\n  </p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, you will not get confused. <strong>My celestial arrows in the sky will show you the way.</strong> I am sure, even Mom would have figured it out, and he is the god of foolishness. You are better than this, right?\r\n  </p>\n<p>Now get moving and fulfill the wish of your greatest god! And remember: do not let my sheep get hurt or die. <strong>If you dare to lose, I will turn the wrath of all Olympus on you!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:52:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e34363f19badf48c0709ecd61245ff8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nik Chernyakov", "Aleksandr Nariadchikov", "Otherside Bay", "naughtybird", "Karolina Boiko"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
