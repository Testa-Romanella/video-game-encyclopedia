I'm hoping that the builder tool I\u00a0used for those OSes simply works &gt;_&gt; Let me know if this is not the case.</p>\n<p><em>At a certain age, it's expected that everyone will go on an \"adventure\", traveling the country, meeting people, and learning about the world. Today is your birthday. You're of adventuring age, and your friends and family have gathered to wish you safe travels...</em></p><p>Suikomon (working title) is a fantasy RPG with \"MSPaint-style\" graphics (for lack of a better term; I\u00a0did NOT actually use MSPaint; I\u00a0would die). It's cute, silly, weird, and a little epic.</p>\n<p>Suikomon is not done yet, but I'm releasing it at this stage of development because I'd love to get your feedback! Let me know what works for you, and what doesn't. There's a lot to discover in the game already!</p>\n<p>Things I've drawn inspiration from:</p>\n<ul><li>PsyPets: a web-game I\u00a0ran for 7 years. It's a smorgasbord of ideas, wrapped in a silly package. 7 years is a long time to work on a project;\u00a0that game's ideas will be with me for the rest of my life. I\u00a0think that's a good thing :)</li><li>Wuppo:\u00a0a platforming action-adventure RPG that Steam kept insisting I\u00a0look at. You win this time,\u00a0Steam! Wuppo was an excellent game, with silly graphics, wonderful world-building, and an epic plot.</li><li>Suikoden:\u00a0when I\u00a0was a kid, this Play Station 1 game BLEW MY MIND. Collecting characters to build your very own castle... down to the kid who says \"Welcome to such-and-such Castle!\" I was in love with this game.\u00a0If you're familiar with the Suikoden games, you will see its influence clearly in Suikomon.</li><li>Pokemon:\u00a0the initial concept for Suikomon was\u00a0Suikoden + Pokemon (hence the name). I\u00a0think Suikoden is the larger influence, but the casualness with which you - the player &amp; PC - are expected to engage in adventure is definitely a core part of the Pokemon games. (The Sequelitis video on the Zelda games is also an influence here.)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fc/8fc98b3c22b4e68db522eaa279559b3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["benmakesgames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
