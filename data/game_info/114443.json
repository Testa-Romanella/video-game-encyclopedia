You are a madman who simply goes by Madd Mann, and you perceive the world as a place where you run around in circles from an unrelenting wall, avoiding world gaps and spikes in the process. The wall conceals and reveals new terrain, and new to the series, wraps around the circle, always staying in view. The further you get from it, the closer you get to it!</p>\n<p>Maddening Relapse will eventually also be available on iOS, Android, and potentially Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. I may also get around to other releases as well. Such is the power of GameMaker: Studio!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/daea88b2871ccd2bd63886bd647b0049.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NAL"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
