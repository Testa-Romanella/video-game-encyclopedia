On the way to the treasure, you will encounter enemies who don't like you very much. However, if you beat them into submission (less than 50% HP), you can convert them into your friends, allowing you to use them as attack or status cards in your own deck! Be careful of who you choose though because whoever is left behind will join the mysterious Big Bad's deck and fight against you once more! Good luck, and happy hunting!<br/></p>\n<p>Programmed by Diego Ochoa</p>\n<p>Lead Artist\u00a0Cameron Sigua</p>\n<p>Supporting Artist Daniople</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T21:00:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/323/3234117db1afb6176e3169396e435012.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Diego Ochoa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
