There's monsters on this island. Do you really think you've got what it takes to survive? Or do you think you're cut out for much more than that... You don't think you could actually... THRIVE... do you? Besides... It's not always the big, scary beasts that you should be afraid of...  Beasts are easy to predict. They just want to kill and eat ya! Humans are much harder... They pretend to be your friend first...<br/><br/>What is  Survivor Dieland?  Well, in essence,  Survivor Dieland  is a comedic survival simulator. It's our way of reading the feedback players have left for us on previous titles such as The Test Trilogy and others, taking their words into heavy consideration, and creating new experiences that players want! Everyone imagines being trapped in a zombie apocalypse... Everyone thinks about surviving on a desert island at one point or another... But how many people would actually cut it? How many people would actually survive, how many would die, and how many would thrive? Well, this simulator asks you a series of questions, and through your answers, will let you know what survival situation it believes you'd excel in! Would you survive being kidnapped by a serial killer? What if you were stuck in the caveman days, would your bloodline continue on? Stranded in the ocean? Earth overrun by robots? Would you Survive, or would you be just another victim on Survivor Dieland?<h3>Features:</h3><br/><ul><li> Short and sweet<br/></li><li> Be a part of history with Player - Developer interaction<br/></li><li> The only game with this theme of its kind<br/></li><li> Very atmospheric and psychological<br/></li><li> Sit back, relax, and answer in-depth questions to reveal survival scenarios<br/></li><li> Super affordable for a unique experience<br/></li><li> A little bit funny.
