So I build a bare bones stealth game with basic shapes. Another `simplicity` concept I added to the game was the concept simple to play but hard to master. Since anybody could play the game given enough time but mastering to beat the high score will require some mastery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The multiplayer aspect of the game is that each level is a room and you are joined by the other players who are also stuck in that level.</p>\n<p>Most of the art was done by\u00a0@macomixart go check him out if you guys like his work :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:46:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/77378e67017583d28ed001d6836dafb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jonhans123"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
