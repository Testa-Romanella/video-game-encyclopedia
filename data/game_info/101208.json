Hopefully me and my holograms can figure our way out of here! - <strong>Graham <br/></strong></p>Holo-Graham<p>Holo-Graham is a strategic puzzle game based in a 4D World! <br/>Record your 'holo-grahams' to perform actions in real time and work along side them to solve complex puzzles. <br/><br/>The full game consists of 30 hand made, and thoroughly tested levels. <br/>This demo contains the tutorial levels and 6 of the final levels. </p><p>Although the levels in this demo are not as complex as the levels later in the game, they should give you a great understanding of the game play and hopefully encourage you to vote for my game on steam! Vote yes to show your support! </p><p>Figure out the series of switches and time their activation to compete the level within the allotted time of your power bar. If your power bar depletes, your holo-grahams malfunction.</p><p><strong>Linux Demo: - Let me know if this works, I do not have a test environment for this.
