I have always been fascinated with old technology, and I fear that much of what I once found to be \"cutting-edge\" is now on the precipice of obsolescence. This was initially intended to be an experimental demo for the player to mess around inside\u00a0a camera menu. But, as I kept tinkering, the project evolved, and a sort of dialogue came\u00a0into being.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These little vignettes are personal &amp; dance in-and-around many truths.
