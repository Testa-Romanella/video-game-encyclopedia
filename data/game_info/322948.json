{"id": 322948, "slug": "riverside", "name": "RiverSide", "name_original": "RiverSide", "description": "<p>RiverSide will be a open-ish world horror game with challenges. There will be 3 Mansion's on the map each with their own difficulty and requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You need to unlock certain areas to gather certain parts and keys to build a boat to get off this small island near the main-lands. The bridge between the main-land and island failed leaving you stranded there. The ocean is below freezing and the rive running through the small island is a mucky swamp that you will have to sail through once the boat and or raft is built.</p>\n<p>(This isn't gonna be a scream in your face game or loud booms and yada yada)</p>\n\n<p>Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/OpendixStudios</p>\n<p>Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/32aztAZ\u00a0</p>\n<p>twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/OpendixStudios\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Release date: TBD</p>\n<p>Length to beat game: Aiming for an hour or so, longer if possible</p>\n<p>Price: Free or 1$ (I'm putting money into this game and alot of time, I do work aswell and time and money is limited so we'll see)</p>\n<p>Why so cheap or free? Well simply because I want anyone to be-able to play. So Free and everyone can play. 1$ Helps me out a little and still lets pretty much everyone play.</p>\n<p>Will quality lack? No. I don't like low quality horror games with nothing to them. I made a couple games to up my skills and those built my skills way up to improve such as: Ray casting, Save systems, UI work, Level design, Story and Graphics. Which thus far (In my opinion) are good.</p>\n<p>So thanks for reading and I hope it's something the horror community looks forward to!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T05:10:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/035/03514c0aa5b025bbbd4eb9147fd927a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["opendixstudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
