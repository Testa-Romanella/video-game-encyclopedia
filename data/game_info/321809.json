Mature plants only.</p>\n<p>If you win, you can continue planting as long as you like!</p>\n<p>Version 1.1 Updates:</p>\n<p>Tweaked starting Mana, increased Berry value, increased Mushroom value, decreased cost of planting Spinach to encourage players to plant this defensive item and added to it's description in the instructions.
