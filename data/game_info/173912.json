But by the end of the five weeks, this\u00a0had reached a state where I was satisfied with it and that it was finished enough to release.</p>\n\n<p>Days Unknown refers to the central theme of time and disjointed experiences. This is the first entry in a\u00a0series of personal projects that I'm planning to develop and release for free.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking this out and feel free to\u00a0share your thoughts and feedback\u00a0below!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76b8e7158b1f09135df091a19b4f0a35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jake Rowe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
