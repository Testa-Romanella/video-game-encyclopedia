Frontier pioneers and bounty hunters have set carriage treks towards the fabled gold discovery sites in Klondike and Yukon, and to the great plains and deserts of Texas or New Mexico.<br />\nYour wagon convoy ran into a bandit ambush and left you behind as the only survivor, but certainly grim with anger to bring those gunslingers to the hangman! Or shoot them right off their horses!<br />\nBut before, there\u2019s some crafting to do - a shelter for the night, some wood logging for bow and arrows, maybe even mining some ore for horse shoes and trading with the Indians. Perhaps they can teach you how to hunt deer for cooking a steak\u2026<br />\nEmbark on this incredible exploration journey in the Wild West, Cowboy! Yee-haw! \ud83e\udd20</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-27T11:22:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/989/989fec4f538d245d876c8a678acbcfe2_P9F1B0h.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Helio Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["HELIO"], "esrb_rating": null}
