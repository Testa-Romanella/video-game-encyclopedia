Competition is so fierce, people have started referring to this era as the \"Warring Idols Period.\"<br/>Down on his luck and forced to leave his employee dorm, young producer Nobuyuki Kinoshita runs into an old friend, Ai Amane. Little does he know that this chance reunion will have far-reaching consequences.<br/>After inviting Nobuyuki to move in with her, and learning that his company is running low on talent, Ai makes a suprising declaration:<br/>\"I want to be an idol!\"<br/>Now, Ai is determined to help Nobu save ODA Productions from bankruptcy, and to transform her own life on the path to becoming an idol. <strong> \u2605 Character\u2605 </strong><br/><strong> Ai Amane </strong> (\u5929\u97f3 \u611b)<br/>CV: Yoshino Mizuse(\u6c34\u702c\u3088\u3057\u306e)<br/><br/>Height: 158cm <br/>Weight: 49.5kg<br/>BWH measurements: 87/60/86<br/><br/>\"The Sweet-and-Innocent Girl Next Door\"<br/>Ai and Nobu were friends when they were kids, but they lost touch after her family moved away.<br/>She came to Tokyo for college, and offered a helping hand (and her apartment) to her old friend in his time of need.<br/><br/>A young woman who treats everyone she meets with equal kindness, she practically exudes an aura of purity. Sometimes it's hard to tell if she's really just that nice, or maybe a little niave.<br/>Smart and athletic, she may seem perfect at first, but she can be surprisingly stubborn at times.<br/>She also has a more laid-back, casual side that she only shows in private, and to those she truly trusts.<br/>Ai's kind heart can sometimes get her in trouble. She has a habit of throwing her all into helping people, treating their problems as her own, while forgetting to take care of herself.<br/><br/><br/><strong> Miwako Sakurai </strong> (\u685c\u4e95\u307f\u308f\u5b50)<br/>CV: Mako Mishiro (\u4e09\u4ee3\u771e\u5b50)<br/><br/>Height: 155cm <br/>Weight: 45kg<br/>BWH measurements: 89/58/85<br/><br/>\"The Playful-but-Reliable Mentor\"<br/>A fellow employee at ODA Productions.
