You can try out the jam version, but it's pretty glitchy. I kept the game short while improving every issues, tweaking some things and implementing what I intended to add but couldn't because of time restrictions. Because it was mostly done for a game jam, expect it very short. I hope you'll like it nonetheless!<br/>This may or may not serve as some sort of prototype for a bigger project in the future!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Check my twitter!<br/>Check WangleLine's youtube channel!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b87bb01942d823f2d937efd449ffef3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kwisarts"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
