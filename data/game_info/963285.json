Join\u00a0Castaway Station\u00a0and embark on an unforgettable adventure to survive and escape from a hostile planet!<br/><br/><strong>Description</strong><br/>We took roguelike deckbuilders to a new level in this unique, quest-based survival game. In this deeply narrative-driven game, play two characters as a team, create your own cards, name the beasts you discover, and build decks where cards have limited durability. <br/><br/><strong>Teamwork is Key</strong><br/>You have four characters to choose from, each with their own sets of unique cards and special abilities. Character cards include Teamwork cards that either player can play, and that can work synergistically with the two characters. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Master the Unique Card Mechanics</strong><br/>We\u2019ve introduced some different card mechanics in Castaway Station. In addition to each character\u2019s deck, character cards are also tied to equipment you find, giving you a wide range of customization in battles. These character cards all have a durability mechanic in which a card uses one charge each time you play it. When you play the final charge, the card is depleted and plays twice. You unlock new cards for every 10 cards you deplete.<br/><br/>We also have a third deck\u2500the Story deck, that offers unique cards based on the encounter, the enemies, the location and even the weather. These cards further expand you choices. Either character can play a Story card. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Choose Your Quests</strong><br/>There are 28 missions that are available to the Castaway Station crew. Some are required to further the narrative. Many are repeatable to grow your strength and assets. You choose missions in the shuttle\u2019s Mission Log. <br/><br/>In the Shuttle you can also replicate single use items, enhance your equipment, recharge your cards, and\u2026<br/><br/><strong>Create your Own Cards</strong><br/>One of the more unique aspects of Castaway Station is the Synthesizer where you can create your own custom character cards with a wide variety of attack and defense options. These cards don\u2019t use charges and can be some of the most powerful in the game. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Track the Xenomorphs You Discover</strong><br/>As you discover the flora and fauna on Prima Centauri B, you create a Bestiary with details about the xenomorphs and tips for fighting them. You can even name the beasties yourself. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The Legacy System has Your Back</strong><br/>You won\u2019t make it through the first time or many after that. But each time you fail, you carry forward the new cards that you\u2019ve unlocked, any equipment that you\u2019ve upgraded, and any currency you\u2019ve earned. And if you do finally beat the game, there are 9 more levels of difficulty. <br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>A rich narrative that permeates the entire game, including animated sequences.<br/></li><li>Four survivors who have their own unique cards combine in teams of two in battle.<br/></li><li>Over 200 unique character cards. <br/></li><li>Over 170 Story cards tied to plot elements, locations, and weather.<br/></li><li>A wild assortment of 50 alien creatures living in a unique ecosystem.<br/></li><li>Over 50 pieces of equipment that are tied to cards.<br/></li><li>130+ unique encounters in over 25 different missions with branching paths.<br/></li><li>30+ choice-based decision points that expand the narrative and offer rewards or challenges.<br/></li><li>10 levels of difficulty that progress from hard to impossible.<br/></li><li>Tools for replicating, enhancing, and recharging game items and creating custom cards.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-02T20:54:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88c/88c39166419b564919ea8a2acc91b20f.jpg", "website": "https://castawaystation.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 391, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bad Zombie Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bad Zombie Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
