Each moment is increasingly connected to every other moment. You have to stop this madness!</p>\n<p>You must travel around, talk to people, find clues and fight baddies. But time is broken so you need to do all those things at once! And you have a limited number of lives!</p>\n<p>The controls are explained on the ingame HELP screen - press H at any time to view help and pause the game.</p>\n<p>A playthrough takes about 15 to 20 minutes. You can pause the game whenever you want - and you may want to as things can get a bit frenetic. It may seem utterly chaotic but if you stick with it and get the hang of the controls it'll start to seem less random.</p>\n<p>The browser version should be fine but I've included a Windows download just in case.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>DON'T FORGET THE HELP SCREEN!!!!!!!</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Everything by me except for:</p>\n<p>Graphics<br/>A few bits and pieces from www.pixabay.com<br/>Trees from https://opengameart.org</p>\n<p>Sound<br/>Main music is 'Fluffy Ruffles' by All Star Trio from http://freemusicarchive.org/<br/>Ending music - https://freesound.org/people/cheesepuff/<br/>Bells - https://freesound.org/people/acclivity/<br/>Punch sound - https://freesound.org/people/CastIronCarousel/<br/>Punch sound - https://freesound.org/people/Ekokubza123/<br/>Skid sound (adapted) - https://freesound.org/people/musicmasta1/<br/>Crash sound (adapted) - https://freesound.org/people/DieselsiselMedia/<br/>Ratchet sound (adapted) - https://freesound.org/people/cmusounddesign/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T21:07:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/310/310c61d4f74df27e9d9685b0e81d935a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["fizzhog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
