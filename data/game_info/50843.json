{"id": 50843, "slug": "kaz-ball", "name": "Kaz Ball", "name_original": "Kaz Ball", "description": "Kaz Ball is a fast-paced, 5v5, team space-sport similar to hockey, rugby, or football. The core objective is to grab the ball, and shoot it into your opponent's goal more than they do it to you.<br/><br/>You achieve this by flying to the ball and grabbing it with your grappler. You must then avoid enemy blasters long enough to pass the ball to your team mates, or shoot it into the opposing goal.<br/><br/>When your ship is hit by blaster fire it doesn't explode, but you'll drop the ball, and you sure will spin a lot. You'll need to correct your ship's orientation in order to get back into the action!<br/><br/>Everyone in the game is flying around freely in the huge, open space arena so be sure to use that freedom to pull off some awesome maneuvers, and epic plays!<br/><br/>The game is currently in the middle-stages of development. We currently have a single, never-ending, persistent playtest server running in the cloud. This allows us to continuously integrate new changes into an environment where we can gain valuable feedback on the core mechanics and gameplay.<br/><br/>Please stop by our Discord, and say hello!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T15:18:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f750b98d7e5def47bf8ad84fb4563e34.jpg", "website": "http://www.kazball.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 16, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Doby Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Doby Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
