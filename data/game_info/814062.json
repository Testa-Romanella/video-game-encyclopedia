A burning toilet paper alert has been issued for your area. Please be vigilant and report any suspicious toilet activity. If you believe you have seen someone putting toilet paper on fire, do not approach or attempt to apprehend them. Contact law enforcement immediately!</p>\n<p>Welcome to Brownfinger - a surrealistic 4k Craptastic game coding contribution from Megastyle. All code by Docster, with pixels and sid music by Rotteroy.\u00a0 Testing and feedback from Erik Akeson, Roysterini and Endurion.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Brownfinger is a one button game where all you have to do is to press firebutton to control your character. When you press fire, he will jump. You can do this to pick up the flying toilet paper or to avoid the toilets. On the middle of the screen there is a huge firepit. You must rescue the flying toilet paper from ending in the pit, and if only one piece of paper lights fire, you will die. If you get hit by a toilet, you will be spawned to the other side of the fire. This is the only way you can change sides of the firepit. But be aware, the less you change direction - the more points you will score. Grab multiple rolls of toiletpaper on one side to increase your scoring rate.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T09:03:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90a/90af80bda2e7eef3a5c1d087d312e8dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Docster"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
