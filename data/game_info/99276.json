You can play this game with 3-5 people, and while playing it as a single game session is fun, it\u2019s designed for long term play.  It\u2019s heavily inspired by the American television show <em>Burn Notice</em> and movies like the <em>Bourne</em> trilogy. As much as <strong>Blowback</strong> is about pyrotechnics and car chases, it\u2019s a fish-out-of-water premise: spies stranded without their agency, normal people swept up in intrigue. And, like all multiplayer games, it\u2019s about relationships\u2014 how much can you ask of someone, how much can you disappoint them before they turn their back on you?</p>\n<p>Normally $10 for the PDF, this includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Blowback PDF: 76 pages, full color, 9\u00d77\u2033.</li><li>Printable character sheets</li><li>Job Worksheet</li><li>Operation Plan</li><li>Flow of play quick-reference</li></ul>\n<p>Basically it's everything you need to play except for the dice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/123/123777a2076011469e49b47715de64c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elizabeth Sampat"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
