When air becomes hot enough, its particles spread out thus reducing air density, which in turn generates Lift!\u00a0This basic principle is what allows hot air balloons to remain airborne for extended periods of time: Hot air becomes trapped within the sack thus inflating it and lifting it off the ground. In this Pixel-style game, we demonstrate this simple yet fascinating phenomenon.\u00a0\u00a0But careful! should you collide with birds, your balloon will drop to the ground.</p>\n<p>-----------------------Credits -----------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Jasmin Stahn: Game Art</p>\n<p>https://jstahn.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Geumseong Han: Programming</p>\n<p>https://taengyi.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Mark Braasch: Character Design</p>\n<p>https://subbucket.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created at the\u00a0Game Design // UE\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Europe for Applied\u00a0Sciences.<br/>Supervised by:\u00a0Prof. Csongor Baranyai<br/>\"Game-A-Week\"\u00a0 (WinterSemester 2020/21)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:35:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a34/a34154d6e67692a5ed61732da696cd2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TaengYi", "jstahn", "subbucket"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
