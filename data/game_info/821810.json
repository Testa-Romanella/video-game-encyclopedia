You start in a room where you need to find and reach your destination point (dice).</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 <strong>First level</strong> seems pretty easy but everything changes when you encounter a dice that is too high to reach. Using special abilities you are able to do unexpected changes to the level (just like rolling a dice): change gravity, flip levels, move platforms, stop the time and much more!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Constrols:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Move</strong> - A/D<br/><strong>Jump </strong>- Space/W<br/><strong>Interact</strong> - E<br/><strong>Roll the Dice</strong> - R</p>\n\n<p>The game you are about to download was made in 48 hours during the biggest game making marathon - GMTK gamejam 2022.\u00a0</p><p><strong><br/>Sorry for any bugs in advance!</strong><br/><br/>Credits:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Game by</strong> -\u00a0PolyCube</li><li><strong>Music by</strong> -\u00a0J0shexe\u00a0 &amp;\u00a0Mr_MusicGuy</li><li><strong>Playtesting</strong>\u00a0 - CatGumba</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T11:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2a/b2ad89af393e17aa551f4d2abd728913.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RealPolyCube"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
