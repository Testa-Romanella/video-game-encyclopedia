Lead a team of two snipers through a dangerous area. Your goal is to kill all of the enemy snipers!\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>Your snipers are ones that are not rotating on their own. Any sniper that is moving on its own is an enemy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you left click one of your snipers, a light will show up around it, indicating it's selected and ready to move. You can then use WASD to move it and Q and E to rotate it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you right click one of your snipers, a green line will come out of it. This is your sniper's laser and must be used to kill enemy snipers.\u00a0\u00a0When your sniper's laser is set on one of the enemy snipers, press SPACE and it will countdown to fire. Be careful not to run into any enemy sniper lasers!</p>\n<p>Enemies with blue lasers require one shot to kill. Enemies with red lasers require two shots to kill. REMEMBER: a sniper's laser must be on for it to fire!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave any constructive criticism in the comments. Also let me know if you'd like to see this become a full game.\u00a0Good luck\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Design and Programming: Alex Robbins\u00a0https://arobbs67.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Sniper Sprites and Animation:\u00a0https://craftpix.net/product/zombie-tds-main-characters/</p>\n<p>Environment Sprites:\u00a0https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-zombie-tds-tilesets-buildings-and-furniture/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:28:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/418/418c563792a4da66c0707ba42b288751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ARobbs67"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
