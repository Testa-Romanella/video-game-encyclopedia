Slower than the others but with a large fuel tank and a huge carrying capacity for the biggest of jobs.</p>\r\nNew Environments\r\n<p>A range of maps and coastline to explore and fly over as you are sent on a variety of search and rescue missions</p>\n<p>Varying environmental conditions create extra challenges as you navigate in wind, rain and fog. Night time missions require sharp eyes and good use of your searchlight and flares.</p>\r\nMore Visuals\r\n<p>There\u2019s also a whole heap of new graphical enhancements, like more detailed helicopters and water ripples.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c087c5f08a0613939b449b824643692d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Triangular Pixels"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
