You play as Stubbs, an undead antihero who takes on a futuristic city using nothing but his own carcass and the weapons of his possessed enemies. This third-person action game uses the Halo engine and integrates tongue-in-cheek humor and a strong storyline with innovative combat.<br />\nIn death, Stubbs has finally achieved the success and power he never had in life - and he sees no reason to stop until all of Punchbowl, Pennsylvania is his. Of course, billionaire playboy industrialist Andrew Monday has other ideas. The tension mounts until the city explodes in a full-scale human vs. zombie war.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2005-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T12:56:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2a7/2a78d5a02588ba925d87d4c76c7f0802.jpg", "website": "https://stubbshub.com/", "rating": 3.74, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 85, "owned": 906, "beaten": 116, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 64, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 140, "ratings_count": 141, "suggestions_count": 443, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 143, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "macOS", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Aspyr Media", "Wideload Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Aspyr"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
