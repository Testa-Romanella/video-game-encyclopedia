With an unknown alien Attacker banging at your windows, you must use your remaining defenses sparingly in order to buy time for your ship to make it to its destination, so that you can use the escape pod.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Changing Defense and Collecting Volts</p>\n<p><strong>HOW\u00a0TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>There are 3 windows: one to the north, one to the south-east and one to the south-west of the ship. The Attacker may only attempt to get in one window at a time, and you can hear them try to get in (knocking sounds). You must use Volts collected from Volt Boxes around the map at the Terminal in the centre to block off the window you think the Attacker is coming from.</p>\n<p>If the Attacker breaks in, you will have reduced vision and will have to rely on your hearing to avoid them. For the cost of 3 Volts, you may decontaminate the ship by moving to the Airlock right at the bottom of the map, removing the Attacker from the ship. While you are Breached, your ship will be stationary and therefore you won't be making progress towards winning the game.</p>\n<p>Remember to keep your oxygen filled at blue areas around the map. You lose if you are caught by the Attacker or if you run out of oxygen. You win if you can keep the Attacker out of the ship long enough for the timer at the top of the screen to get to zero, and then escape through the Escape Pod\u00a0(west of the Airlock).</p>\n<p><strong>MAP:</strong></p>\n<p>In retrospect, I was a bit harsh with how little you can see in the game. If I were to update, adding more lighting would definitely be a top priority. But as a temporary solution, here's a map to help you guys out:</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p>Game and Art by crompo.</p>\n<p>Sounds all from freesounds.org, edited with Audacity.</p>\n<p>Font: Neuterous by Chequered Ink</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T03:52:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc9b3a1d04a7333a239e55fdca0c41d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["crompo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
