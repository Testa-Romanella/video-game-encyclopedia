You will cast and dodge elemental spells to destroy the enemies and survive.<br/><br/>In each multiplayer battle, players are divided in two 4-player teams. Players can attack using a variety of elemental spells, which can also be combined to form even more powerful ones. As a defence, players can either choose to dodge spells or can raise an energy shield than can provide temporary protection. Each player controls a platform and can teleport themselves onto other platforms using a spell.<br/><br/>Clash of Spells is a skill-based game where players need to use their aim and reflexes to beat other players. Despite being a competitive game, Clash of Spells also encourages team play, as players can heal other team members and coordinate their attack to deal more damage to the enemy team.Features<ul><li>4 vs 4 team deathmach multiplayer mode<br/></li><li>Bots<br/></li><li>16 different spells<br/></li><li>3 game maps<br/></li><li>More to come</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26d/26d2b9cf91daa95491404602c70a0adf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vergence Lab"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vergence Lab"], "esrb_rating": null}
