The class system is present in the game. There are four classes in the game: Blaster, Deputy, Gunslinger, and a Trapper. Every class grants a bonus to their teammates. For example, the Blaster can increase the defense stat of his teammates. The classes are designed to cover every range of the battlefield. The Blaster and the Gunslinger are short range classes, while the Deputy and the Trapper should be used in the middle to long range combat.</p>\n<p>There is no singleplayer campaign present in the game, yet there are 6 different game modes: Conquest, Greed, Powderkeg, Robbery, Shootout, and Demolition. Every game mode requires a lot of teamwork from the players. For example, in Greed mode, the objective of the players is to capture the only bag full of gold on the map and get it to a specific safe zone.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2010-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:47:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dad/dadc0032edd296fe58638f36c348919b.jpg", "website": "http://www.leadandgold.com", "rating": 2.54, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 47, "owned": 1622, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 50}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 94, "ratings_count": 122, "suggestions_count": 590, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 123, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fatshark"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Fatshark"], "esrb_rating": null}
