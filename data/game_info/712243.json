You\u2019ve just received your doctorate in Galactic<br/>Digging Discoveries (GDD) at the Graz University of Technology. Receiving a tip from an<br/>anonymous source you embark on a mission to an unknown planet to look into the remains<br/>of a rare alien species that supposedly lived there long ago. While digging through the<br/>crust of the planet you discover that the supposed-to-be fossils are still alive and angry. In<br/>a last-ditch effort you improvise your mining drill to fight the approaching hordes of living<br/>fossils. After barely surviving your first encounter you leave with the materials you could<br/>gather from the aliens. Talking with an older colleague he\u2019s surprised to learn you didn\u2019t<br/>know about the details of your calling. It seems you\u2019re just at the beginning of a wonderful<br/>journey.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T08:52:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0a7517ec4c991e6f4803736ad391603.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tmist3r", "Sebastian Pinter", "humpny"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
