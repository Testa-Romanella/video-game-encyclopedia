GUNS! Advance your golf ball throughout the course by shooting it with different powered guns, or screw over your opponents by shooting their golf balls (be sure when you do this because it will still cost you a stroke and probably make your opponents mad). Play casually (or seriously if you want) with friends (currently up to 8 players) or random opponents online to shoot the lowest score.<strong>Never run out of fun</strong> with community-made maps in the workshopWith an in-game map creator, anyone can bring their map ideas to life and contribute to the never-ending fun! Have an idea for a new asset or game mode? Make a post about it in the workshop where the community can vote on it. Highly requested features will likely make it into future releases.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T07:40:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/621/6213e07103885b2f5f0deade8fce16b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BirdyB Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BirdyB Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
