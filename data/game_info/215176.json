I believe that if all humans have the possibility to study, future technology will come faster. This is the reason that I am currently making this game in my spare time. Often when donating to charity you just get a \u201cThank you\", but here we can collect money as a community and donate that as whole to a project. Furthermore this gives us the option to follow the development of that and of course you, the donaters, gets a game that you can play and enjoy.</p>\n<p>The current state of the game is not optimized for WebGl.</p>\r\nGameplay\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>When you play the game, you are a little girl who needs to collect water for her village.
