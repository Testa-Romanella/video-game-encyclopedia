Until it turns out the venue was built on a graveyard full of angry disco spirits who hate what the youngin's are listening to these days!</p>\n<p>Build your band, protect the stage, and create rocking tunes while doing it! In Concert Tower Defense, you need to protect the stage from a wave of disco ghosts intent on tearing it down. Place instruments to repel the ghosts, and build up a tune as you add them. Each instrument has three unique tracks which unlock as you place more of them.</p>\n<p>This game is an experiment and there are so many things I would like to tune but just don't have time for. There is only a single wave and it's not the most challenging but I hope the experience of building up your band and creating a song is fun. Maybe I will be able to come back to this project one day.<br/></p>\r\nLinks\r\n<p>Check out the\u00a0Source Code</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter</p>\n<p>Check out other projects on my\u00a0Website</p>\n<p>Follow the artist on Instagram<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T03:30:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51d02af91dd83934e8dd11cb5f932bc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenPartridge"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
