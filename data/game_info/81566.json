It contains the tutorial and the first three levels of tier 1. The full version has 20 levels in 4 tiers.<br/><br/>Robo Logic is a neat logic game. You have to \"program\" a robot's movements by dragging commands to the memory of the bot. Your goal is to activate all the marked boxes.<br/><br/>Very soon you will realize though that using only the main memory is not enough and you will have to start creating and calling re-usable functions to achieve the goal.  <br/><br/>RoboLogic is very easy to learn, but hard to master.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T04:54:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/042/04206a992562025a788d2da837a183da.jpg", "website": "http://www.digitalsirup.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["digitalsirup"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["digitalsirup"], "esrb_rating": null}
