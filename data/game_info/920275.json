Propelled into this parallel world, nature wants to revenge and drowning you, however, vegetation is making plants to grow that make you a chance to escape from your doom. Climbing the heights as fast as you can, you'll finally find a bird nest be like a rooted raft that you use to float on the emerging sea to escape, waiting the waters to recede at the surface.</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Richelle Bourbeau - Environment Modeling\r\n</p>\n<p>Kennedy Garneau - 3D Modeling &amp; Animation\r\n</p>\n<p>Clark Prendgergast - Programming\r\n</p>\n<p>Jonathan Pord - Sound Effects\r\n</p>\n<p>Florian Dhieux - Music &amp; Story</p>\n<p>Aeolus Zhai - Group Coordinator\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T09:22:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50b/50be4a8218d34ef4f3df5ed24a5dd6c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AeoluZzz"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
