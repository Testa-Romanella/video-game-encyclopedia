As he revisits a place he hasn\u2019t been to in fifteen years, an unexpected specter from his past emerges, forcing him to face those ghosts once again in new ways.<br/><br/><strong>. . . . . .</strong><br/><br/><strong>NOTE:</strong> Memories of East Coast seeks to provide a new, refreshing, and immersive visual novel experience unlike any other. We used a different approach with this project; in order to let the readers immersed in the story, we carefully picked a list of suitable music that fits in with the background art and the story. In addition, we purposefully not include any character images.<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li>Lo-fi music.<br/></li><li>Immersive story.<br/></li><li>Psychological advice.<br/></li><li>Memory-trigger moments.<br/></li><li>Ice cream!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T02:52:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31bc0a287a48f45f7758f180d06d2911.jpg", "website": "https://steamcommunity.com/id/roomahgaming", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roomah Gaming"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Roomah Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
