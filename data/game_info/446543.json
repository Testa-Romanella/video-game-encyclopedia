I would also like to thank every member of my family and friends that helped with the testing portion of the game.<br/><br/>inspirations / why you were drawn to make this game:<br/>I was inspired by a couple of shows that were airing on YouTube at the moment.<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y1ocyudjs\u00a0/ living through depression, Julia's story.\u00a0<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWloIAQpMcQ/ how to cope with anxiety, Olivia Remmes.\u00a0<br/>These types of content inspired me to create something that talks about these deep subjects, such as depression and anxiety. I figured out the best way to express these emotions in a game would be a narrative type base of game.<br/>I created a main character that struggles through depression and anxiety. The main character has to battle through such hardship by himself.\u00a0<br/>Later during the development I created a counterpart for my MC, \"the voices\".<br/>This character plays an important role as it allows the users to feel more in touch with the MC, and\u00a0allowing users to immerse more into the psyche of the character.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I have attached development photos on my blog.\u00a0Here are some more:http://www.mediafire.com/file/xwkr6gttqldlgml/development_pics.rar/file</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:54:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdf/bdf7af1a8d7f7c45d282417bb49d2614.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shorizon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
