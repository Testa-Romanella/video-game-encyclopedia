Works well at conferences.</p><p>\r\n\tFirst team to finish building their tower wins! Shout when your team color lights up, the louder you yell the faster they work.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSort of a turn based racing game and not just about yelling as loud as possible all the time.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you play with a huge crowd give them different vocals to shout so it's more clear what's going on. I recommend: AAA,III,OOO.</p><p>Former version was called AAARRGH and you can read about the prototypes at the Copenhagen Game Collective Blog.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a92f76d54150f1944e63a956e6814b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["timgarbos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
