In any case, please enjoy!\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>E</strong> - Blink Forward (1s Cooldown)</p>\n<p><strong>WASD </strong>- Movement</p>\n<p><strong>SHIFT</strong> - Walk\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SPACE</strong> - Jump</p>\r\nChangelog\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n<p>Immersion breaking footsteps sound removed.<br/>Re-balanced difficulty level. The game is a bit more forgiving now:<br/>- Player character now sprints by default (you can still press Shift to walk for that sweet sweet #immersion)<br/>- Blink distance slightly increased.<br/>- Re-arranged the floating rocks a tiny bit to make the first level easier to complete.</p>\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n<p>Fixed the issues with poor visibility of the dialogue text.</p>\r\nVersion 1.3\r\n<p>I finally managed to find a solution for one of the major dialogue bugs! Dialogue text won't get stuck on the screen anymore after you leave the conversation with an NPC.</p>\n<p><strong>It's highly recommended that you download this version of the game as there's no additional content in the updates - only major bug fixes and balance improvements that shouldn't be against LD terms. </strong>That said, the original version of the game will be available for download at all times so feel free to pick it up if you prefer.<br/></p>\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n<p>I used some free 3d models from various free Unity Asset Store packages:<br/>Low Poly's Pack vol. 2 by Works For Fun (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-s-pack-vol-2-46375)<br/>Low Poly Survival Essentials by Broken Vector\u00a0(https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/tools/low-poly-survival-essentials-109444)<br/>FREE Skybox - Cubemap Extended by BOXOPHOBIC\u00a0(https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/free-skybox-cubemap-extended-107400)<br/>Heart Model by JeremyWoods</p>\n<p>Everything else (logic, some 3d models, story, music, writing,\u00a0sound effects, image effects, particle effect and every other kind of effects) was created by my humble self a.k.a. <strong>@LemonBalmGames</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55befe7cc07ae3c859bd0fa27a61c1ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LemonBalmGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
