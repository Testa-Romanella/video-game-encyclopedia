Tired of left-clicking through hordes of brainless one-hit-KO enemies? Random dungeons, precise controls via gamepad (or keyboard) and a strong fighting game AI provide challenging encounters. Be prepared!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\"Legends of Pixelia plays like a beat 'em up dressed in rogue-like \r\ndungeons. [\u2026] The systems that are in place are really solid, and the \r\ngameplay ideas come through in the form of a fun, multiplayer beat em' \r\nup in a dungeons-and-dragons-like vibe.\"\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tLuke Siuty\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\"Legends of Pixelia is an excellent pixel art action RPG with gameplay reminiscent of The Binding of Isaac, but with more tactical combat, persistent upgrades and local multiplayer.\"\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tCalum Fraser\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\"Legends of Pixelia is familiar enough to be approachable to fans of the genre while still offering up something new.
