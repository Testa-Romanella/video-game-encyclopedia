Otherwise, you might end up being tomorrow's stew...Welcome to Cannibal Cooking !<br/></p>\n<p>This is my second \"finished\" game, which took me waaay too long to craft. Some months ago, I thought to myself \"what about a cooking game with weird recipes like brain sorbet or something ? \", and gave it a try. Probably a bit ambitious for my skills, it was very interesting nonetheless and I learnt tons of stuff about UI, interactions between 2D and 3D elements and the fact that pixel art is not a joke.<br/></p>\n<p>Done mainly with Unity, Visual Studio, Mixamo, and Pixilart. Some features are still clunky and the saving system is not implemented yet but I hope you'll have fun playing it anyway ! Use the Help section and the Cook Book to guide you, or ask me directly in the comments section if you need. Enjoy !</p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs and issues :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>- Cooked items from the oven and fryer won't find the fridge inventory if the fridge is closed, therefore hang in the air where you dropped them. This happens with tools sometimes too.</p>\n<p>- Customers will sometimes only instantiate empty thinking bubble without any dish sprite inside. <br/></p>\n<p>- Cook button sometimes doesn't spawn when it should.</p>\n<p>- Items from main and fridge inventory will sometimes disappear / re-appear for some strange reason (spoiler : this actually happens because my code is a giant mess).<br/></p>\n<p>- The reward paper duplicates rewards, therefore giving the player the same unique reward multiple times.</p>\n<p>- And probably many more (but not as many as Battlefield 2042).<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>3D model by SYNTY Studios.</p>\n<p>Jukebox Music player by \u00a0Suheb Qureshi<br/></p>\n<p>Procedural Skyboxes by Boxophobic.</p>\n<p>Procedural UI Image by Josh H.<br/></p>\n<p>Pixelart by Me (sorry some of these look really bad).<br/></p>\n<p>AUDIO\r\n:<br/></p>\n<p>- Nile's Blues Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\n</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\r\n</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/\r\n</p>\n<p>- Degenerate Blues by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Music promoted on https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/\r\n</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\r\n</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Warm Duck Shuffle by arnebhus | https://soundcloud.com/arnebhus\r\n</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License\r\n</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US\r\nMusic promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/<br/></p>\n<p>- BLOOM by Uniq |\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/uniqofficial/\r\n</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/\r\n</p>\n<p>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\r\n</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\r\n</p>\n<p>- Walk that Dog by US Army Blues |\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>- 1st dance by US Army Blues |\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Wind sound Home Scene :\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/PatrickLieberkind/sounds/244961/\r\n</p>\n<p>Ambient Bunker Home Scene :\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Soundholder/sounds/425367/\r\n</p>\n<p>MeatSound Home Scene :\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/MWLANDI/sounds/85853/\r\n</p>\n<p>ChainsawSound Home Scene :\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/418042/\r\n</p>\n<p>Writing Sound Daily Report Scene :\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/398271/\r\n</p>\n<p>Night Ambient Sound Daily Report Scene :\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Clearwavszound/sounds/523439/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T19:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96a/96ab468d4664fa7a4191693d300c051e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mj Sirius Industries"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
