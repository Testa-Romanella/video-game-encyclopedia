Please make sure you remember to leave a comment so I can know how I did. This game was kinda conceived on a whim after the Ludum game jam. <br/></p>\n<p>You play as the last of your civilization and his sword, Birthrite,  as they try to unlock all the runes and see if there is a way to revive  his people.\r\n</p>\n<p>The core theme is that words are power. Each of your spells is words in an invented language that have personal meaning to the main character.  They also have an effect on the sword \"Birthrite\". The initial phrases are very simple but have the possibility to become more complicated and do more down the line. <br/></p>\n<p>*Controls*</p>\n<p>WASD/ArrowKeys - Movement</p>\n<p>Speed up movement - Shift<br/></p>\n<p>Spacebar - Jump<br/></p>\n<p>J/Ctrl - Speak (overworld)<br/></p>\n<p>Pause Menu - Escape<br/></p>\n<p>I won't say which spells do what:<br/></p>\n<p>but one heals you, one heals you and does damage to all enemies, one only does damage to all enemies, and one only damages you<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p><p>Modeling, Programming, and Design by Eddie Fulton</p><p>Music:</p><p>Ultimate Game Music Collection by John Leonard French</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T07:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/882/88234439599d428ed49e11642bb8e435.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KindSpark"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
