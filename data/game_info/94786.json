Created as part of a long-running video tutorial series. If you want to learn how to make a game like this, check out this playlist.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>You control the pad at the bottom of the screen. You need to destroy the bricks by hitting them with a ball. If the ball leaves the bottom of the screen you lose. You need to move your pad left and right to keep the ball on the screen.</p>\n<p>If you move the pad while you hit the ball, you can change the angle of the ball's trajectory. There are also different powerups, which appear when you destroy a blue block.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Use the cursor keys to move left or right</li><li>Use the X, M or V key to confirm (X)</li><li>Use the Z, M or C key to cancel (O)</li></ul>\r\nPowerups\r\n<ul><li>Orange = Slow - Slows down time\u00a0</li><li>White = Extra Life - Gives you an additional extra life\u00a0</li><li>Green = Sticky - Makes you pad sticky. It makes the ball stick to the paddle so you can launch it again\u00a0</li><li>Blue = Expand - Expands the size of your pad\u00a0</li><li>Black = Reduce - Shrinks you pad but also gives you a 10x score modifier\u00a0</li><li>Red = Megaball - Lets the ball smash through blocks without changing direction\u00a0</li><li>Yellow = Multiball - Splits the ball into two balls. You only lose a life if you lose your last ball</li></ul>\n<p>Sudden Death - if there are only 3 bricks left when the ball hits the pad, the game goes into Sudden Death mode. Bricks will start blinking as they are about to explode. If you hit a brick while it's blinking, you'll get extra points.</p>\r\nScoring\r\n<p>Hitting multiple bricks in a row increases your score multiplier to a maximum of 7x. Hitting the ball with the pad resets the multiplier back to 1x.</p>\n<p>Losing all lives resets your score to 0, but you can continue playing. For the highest score possible, try finishing the game without losing your lives.</p>\n<p>For an additional challenge and even more points, press up or down on the start screen for Fast Mode.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming and art by Krystian Majewski\u00a0 from Lazy Devs Academy.</p>\n<p>Music by Gruber Music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c39/c397cfd059bbd8a64c380d06340680f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Krystman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
