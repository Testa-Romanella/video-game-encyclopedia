Its not perfect by any means\u00a0but is intended to learn how a game developer makes a playable level from beginning to end. Its completely free to play. My final assignment is to release it to the world regardless of how un-polished it is and the things it\u2019s lacking\u00a0after the timeframe given to complete the project which was only 7 days. To close the game, you can either win the game by reaching the end or by pressing Alt + F4. I know I apologize for\u00a0it lacking a proper game menu/exit game UI. But it\u2019s all a part of learning game dev from the very beginning I suppose :)</p><p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>~ ItsJustJr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T07:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ec/4ec91b8a02182fa8f1d501ea6afd2a4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ItsJustJr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
