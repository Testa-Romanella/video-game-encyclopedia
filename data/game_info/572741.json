I've recreated the first chapter with new cinematic sequences and other events. Object interaction, collision sounds are there, with some new upgrades like a full body Daniel and\u00a0swaying banners that original game lacked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thea idea came from that even though the game is more than 10 years old now, with a new touch and some upgraded graphics, it'd still hold today.</p>\n\n<p>This has been a great experience for me and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!</p>\n<p>Follow me for my other works:<br/>@Tanshaydar<br/>Personal\u00a0Website</p>\n<p>Also, I've written a detailed post about what and how I did creating this demo.
