Become the User, a nameless character that roams a sentient wasteland,\u00a0an ear-witness to an unliving world. Encounter forgotten technologies and cryptic\u00a0mythologies. Confront, evade and embody other organisms, always at the mercy of a hostile\u00a0and every-changing ecosystem. Fix, break, scavenge and kill for a hope to escape, but most\u00a0of all, do not lose your way... Only the most loyal players have a chance of escaping Deadly\u00a0Structures and uncovering their ultimate purpose. Or do none of this and something else\u00a0entirely. Deadly Structures was conceived as a pareidolic soundworld where each player can\u00a0imagine their own world and will throughout. Deadly Structures is created using the Unreal\u00a0Engine and FMOD and is playable on Mac and PC with additional PS4 and XBOX controller support.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Wormtea (formed by David Denyer and Sami El-Enany) is a game and sound studio\u00a0which aims to expand the possibility of interactive sound and storytelling through their own projects as well as collaborations with other game studios.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game by Wormtea\r\n</p>\n<p>Art by\u00a0Viktor Timofeev\r\n</p>\n<p>Graphic Design by\u00a0Workform\r\n</p>\n<p>Produced by\u00a0Werkflow\r\n</p>\n<p>Wormtea Logo by\u00a0Diana Gradinaru\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommended Hardware:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Operating System</strong>\n</p><p>Windows 10\u00a064-bit/Latest MacOS Big Sur</p><p><strong>Processor</strong>\n</p><p>Quad-core Intel or AMD, 2.5 GHz or faster\r\n</p><p><strong>Memory</strong>\n</p><p>8 GB RAM\r\n</p><p><strong>Video Card/DirectX Version</strong>\n</p><p>DirectX 11 or DirectX 12/Metal 1.2 compatible graphics card\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T05:23:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/73858f053dd5daa7899d9a55a44c6cbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wormtea"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
