So, in the end, have everyday efforts any meaning at all?</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd again: do life and death have a meaning at all? If there is meaning, is it for the good or for the bad?<br/>\nWhy is death a presence in our lives?<br/>\nIs there something beyond the physical after death?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe awareness of our own immanent death is a major feeling. But it's also the beginning of wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the game you'll find scrolls of wisdom that will help you concentrate and think at a more profound level.<br/>\nThe human nature will be unfolded once you'll find all the scrolls.<br/><br/><strong>The VR device is NOT required in order to play the game.<br/>VIVE and Oculus are the supported devices you can use.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-01T23:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d91/d911509fc50744910f8f690b41af42ad.jpg", "website": "http://chubbypixel.com/", "rating": 1.17, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 322, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 394, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fabio Ferrara"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Chubby Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
