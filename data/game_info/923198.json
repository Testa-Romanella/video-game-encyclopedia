Unfortunately, Ratatoskr didn't end up being the game we wanted it and knew it could be.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this project was an invaluable learning experience and I am proud of our work regardless.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T05:38:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13fa060a7b5861ff68f38c4eb3c4c9cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sheepie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
