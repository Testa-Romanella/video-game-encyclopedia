Die faces can't be replaced if they already have a value, so use that to your advantage to sneak past those worthless 1's and pick up more valuable faces!<br/>After each round, your custom die will be rolled\u00a0 and the result will be added to your score. Collected faces are gone from the map\u00a0between rounds, which could be used as part of\u00a0your strategy!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- WASD to move<br/>- R to restart</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T09:49:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ac/5acc03eb6ba64e72557b78b5eaafd62c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["carolynneon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
