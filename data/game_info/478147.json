Sigmoid & Digmoid", "description": "<p>Welcome to\u00a0<strong>Wind-Up Racing</strong>, a game created in a week by Barji and PolyMars\u00a0for the 2020.2 Brackeys Game Jam!</p>\n<p>Join Sigmoid &amp; Digmoid in their quest to become the first aliens to win the interplanetary racing championship with a wind-up car! Sigmoid, the smarter and stronger alien brother, is\u00a0in the pits and must wind up the car each time it runs out of charge. But, because Digmoid can't be trusted as the driver, Sigmoid must also steer the car using a remote alien transmitter. Although the other racers don't have this handicap, they're still using earthly vehicles... so they shouldn't be too hard to beat.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>When in range of your UFO, hold\u00a0the\u00a0<strong>left mouse button\u00a0</strong>to wind it up.\u00a0</li><li>While the UFO is charged, you can steer it using the remote transmitter located near the starting line. Press the\u00a0<strong>left mouse button\u00a0</strong>within range of the remote to take control of the car, and steer it using\u00a0<strong>A\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>D\u00a0</strong>or the\u00a0<strong>left\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>right</strong><strong> arrow keys</strong>.</li><li>Press the <strong>space bar</strong> to jump across fences and quickly move between the UFO and remote.
