How will our captain take it? He'll need to struggle with dock engineers to still have his ship usable and intact after refitting, and while coming up with a way to stay sane in between. There is nothing to do, his crew is on its leave, so our captain is one on one with an alliance of junior dock engineers and boredom. Our novel illustrates one of the episodes of this uneven battle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/158/1583d0f562c8e58f4f33b027b0e40e1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["vn@410"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
