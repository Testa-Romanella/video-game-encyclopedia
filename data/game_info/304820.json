Except when I didn't!</p>\n<p>Thanks goes to Kev Vance &amp; others for KevEdit which made it a lot easier to put the game together, as well as Dr. Dos of Museumofzzt.com\u00a0for beta testing. (This game also has a page on Museum of ZZT: Daedalus' Obelisk.) And of course all of the other old ZZT games I\u00a0ripped off in one way or another. There's no music because I\u00a0am not good at composing ZZT music!</p>\r\nRunning the game\r\n<p>You should use the included CLEANZZT.EXE (or some other mod that hides water messages) or you're going to have a bad time.\u00a0Or play in your browser at\u00a0Archive.org\u00a0or at the top of this page. Also there is a map included in the zip file, but I suggest playing the game first before looking at it. :)<br/></p>\r\nThat is all ...\r\n<p><strong>Hope that you enjoy the game.</strong>\u00a0 Visit my website DOSGames.com for over 800 free &amp; legal MS-DOS games. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-29T05:07:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5af/5affe6aad7446bae1057f91bf74877ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["emmzee"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
