Some said the masks instilled a power within their chosen wearer, others felt it was simply a means of hiding away \u2013 but no one argued with this rule as it had become an oddity to show one's face. Nothing bound, yet silently complied with, a constant normality. It'd been so long since they'd seen each others faces, now only familiar with wood and papier-mache, recognising textures and voices.\r\n</p>\n<p>On a certain fated morning, the elusive community woke up to a shock unlike anything witnessed before; masks had been switched, some even missing entirely from their homes. Those who had been switched were forced to wear their new masks to comply, others had to resort to more desperate measures, heads bagged and hidden.\r\n</p>\n<p>Word said a mischief maker was among them, a shadow that had passed through homes in the night. While panic rose and fingers were pointed, talk only made the possibility of catching the culprit all the more murky.\r\n</p>\n<p>Something strange has happened to this place.\r\n</p>\n<p>No one is acting as themselves, afraid they may be next or their mind is muddled from a mask not of their own, that things may change forever. The fear and confusion is thick in the air, and the annual party among residents has been cancelled.\r\n</p>\n<p>You play as an Inspector, an outsider who has come to investigate the mystery of the masks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T03:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a47b0b065a2428ee8e21a0376ddc2b3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dream Team"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
