You play as a citizen of a region ruled by an oppressive Regime. Your goal is to defy the Regime, strengthening the Resistance, all while just trying to stay alive. You are presented with a series of events and choices, with many outcomes and effects. This is a rough prototype, but was our effort to shed light on the truly terrible realities many people around the world living under oppression face as their every day truth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d8/2d8a261e62e5d3dacf79254fd1203351.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nedwards"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
