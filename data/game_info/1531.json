Early tales of bodiless voices and whispers reached the kings ears. Voices heard by many throughout the kingdom during the darkest of nights. Voices calling out, calling out and drawing them in\u2026<br/><br/>On a dark cold night two of the kings finest knights disappeared. Many believed they fled the kingdom out of cowardice. Not all in the kingdom believed this to be true. Countless disappearances associated with the bodiless voices continued fortnight after fortnight. Castle Cardell became a prison to all who lived within its walls, lords and ladies, princes and princesses were forbidden to leave their quarters after dusk. The disappearances stopped and the tales died down until one cloudy morn when the king was missing from his bed\u2026<br/><br/>Knights wondered how their king could have been taken? Mothers feared for their childrens lives and men slept with one eye open and a knife at their side. The kingdom was isolated to all outsiders. Some wondered if the king simply descended into the dungeons alone looking for the source of evil. Others believed that evil had gained body and come for the king.<br/><br/>Ravens were sent far and wide pleading for help. The greatest heroes of our realm responded with urgency wishing to assist in the quest for the king. The realm thanks you for your haste and pray to the gods for your safety in this matter. This will not be a simple journey and you can not be sure to come out of it with your life. I do not know what creatures and men you will find hidden deep below the floors, legend foretells that they are not from this world. May the gods keep you safe on this quest to the core.<br/><br/><br/><br/>- Customize Your Hero -<br/>Use an old school roller to create a fully unique character<br/>6 Classes - Knight, Rogue, Cleric, Wizard, Druid, Paladin<br/>6 Races - Human, Elf, Orc, Gnome, Vampire, Dwarf<br/>Leveling system that goes up to 30 levels<br/><br/><br/>- Explore The Dungeon -<br/>4 Large Themed Zones (Classic Dungeon, Desert, Jungle, Undead)<br/>Each has its own encampment town which includes shops, libraries, portals and much more!<br/>27 Floors containing over 700 rooms to explore full of Bosses, Traps, Portals, Puzzles and Mystery<br/><br/><br/>- Battle Evil Within -<br/>70+ unique monsters to fight<br/>Turn-based combat (JRPG style)<br/>Over 20 boss encounters<br/>Random monster encounters<br/>Secret passages and battles to find<br/><br/><br/>- In Depth Stat &amp; Skill System -<br/>Featuring 70+ Spells/Skills<br/>Damaging skills - These are direct physical attacks that damage the enemy<br/>Damaging spells - These are direct magical attacks that damage the enemy<br/>Damaging All spells (AOE) - These are direct magical attacks that damage ALL enemies<br/>Healing HP spells - These are spells that heal the casters life/hitpoints (HP)<br/>Healing SP spells - These are spells that heal the casters skill points (SP)<br/>Buffing skills - A skill that user casts on itself to raise some stats<br/>Debuffing skills - A skill the caster casts on enemies to lower some stats<br/><br/><br/>- Endless Loot &amp; Treasures -<br/>Hundreds of unique items<br/>12 equipment slots to to fully customize your characters - (Weapon, Shield, Helmet, Chest, Gloves, Legs, Boots, Belt, Bracelet, Necklace, 2x Rings)<br/>Randomized drops on all monsters<br/>Item rarity color system (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Unique)<br/><br/><br/>- Other Features -<br/>Indie created game built for the people!<br/>NO IAP!!!
