That made them the first higher order living organisms to survive in space.</p>\n<p>In this game they go on a second fictitious mission to a remote planet\u00a0 to collect cyber krystals (not to be confused with kyber crystals). <br/></p>\n<p>Due to poor radio transmission only two types of commands can be used - left and right. Press the left or right side of the screen. <br/></p>\n<p>Good luck! Oh yeah - I almost forgot to mention it - there might be alien lifeforms on the planet. Probably nothing to worry about...</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Belka and Strelka grafitti from Kharkiv 2008</p>\n<p>Sounds from Pixabay</p>\n<p>The game engine Phaser</p>\n<p>How to make a Mario-style Platformer with Phaser 3</p>\n<p>https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-make-a-mario-style-platformer-with-phaser-3/</p>\n<p>And last but not least, the Kenney Platformer Art Pixel Redux</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/platformer-art-pixel-redux<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T14:39:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/440/44018cd5adee90bf8f9c811a1be12e1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Magn"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
