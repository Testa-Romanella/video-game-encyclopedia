Including simple but challenging numeric puzzle mini games to improve your math skil", "description": "Numtris starts off from a similar concept as the Letris where the pieces start to fall and you have to complete each level\u2019s objective before the board fills up; to do this you have two simple rules:<br/><br/>RULE 1: To eliminate a number you have to join as many pieces as indicated in the number. For example: <br/>To eliminate number 2 you need to join 2 numbers 2. <br/>To eliminate number 3 you need to join 3 numbers 3.<br/><br/>RULE 2: If you join various numbers and do not comply with rule 1 they will be added up. For example:<br/>If you join a number 1 and a 2: A number 3 will be generated. <br/>If you join a number 1, a 2 and another 1: A number 4 will be generated.<br/><br/>Starting to play is very simple. Stopping is not so easy as your brain exercises more and more as you complete the almost 300 challenges proposed by the game, being a very good amusing challenge.<br/><br/>CHARACTERISTICS:<br/>- Unique, simple and addictive playability.<br/>- Almost 300 free levels.<br/>- Weekly tournaments with prizes.<br/>- Split screen for iPad.<br/>- Synchronisation by iCloud or Facebook.<br/>- Retina graphics for iPhone and iPad.<br/>- Integration with Game Center.<br/>- Universal and free.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T10:47:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dce/dceb4026893139e24ffd05eac27c3b12.jpg", "website": "http://ivanovichgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ivanovich Games"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ivanovich Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
