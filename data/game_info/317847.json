The backpack awards you points every so often, but only one player can carry it!</p>\n<p>Coins come in different sizes and shapes; some of them will launch you, and some of them are traps!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>General Instructions</strong>:</p>\n<p>Press (almost)\u00a0any button to activate your character in the menu! Activating your character means that the player will participate in the battle!<br/></p>\n<p>Press and hold (almost)\u00a0any button to start the game with all participating players!</p>\n<p>Dashing helps you push other players off the platforms without endangering yourself. Use the dash to your advantage by covering larger distances and to keep yourself from bouncing into death coins.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS - Controller (Required for multiplayer) :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>[ LEFT STICK ] -\u00a0\u00a0Move</p>\n<p>[ LEFT/RIGHT TRIGGER ] - Dash</p>\n<p>[ BUTTON\u00a0DOWN (X or A) ] - Jump</p>\n<p>In Menu:\u00a0</p>\n<p>[ LEFT/RIGHT TRIGGER ]\u00a0: Change Outfit</p>\n<p>In Menu:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any button to activate player and hold to\u00a0start the game</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS - Keyboard (Only for one player) :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>[ WASD ] - Move</p>\n<p>[ LEFT SHIFT ] - Dash</p>\n<p>In Menu:\u00a0</p>\n<p>[ Q &amp;\u00a0E ] :\u00a0Change Outfit</p>\n<p>In Menu:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any button to activate player and hold the Enter button to start the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T07:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11c/11c5e1e01724800d94a3363fd70049f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lazanja", "Quexlaw", "forsuse"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
