{"id": 492176, "slug": "food-chain-3", "name": "Food Chain", "name_original": "Food Chain", "description": "You have to control the animal in an uncompromising struggle for survival. Each has its own individual characteristics: mass, speed, manoeuvrability, damage, skin thickness, absorb and dry. The battle takes place on land, in water and in the air. Water is a major resource that activates regeneration and prevents death from thirst. You can distance yourself, but the drought begins and players are forced to go to a risky rapprochement in the fight for the last water.<h3>How not to became Food</h3><ul><li> You need water, just put your head in it.<br/></li><li> Water goes out, it's inevitable.<br/></li><li> Use claws, jaws, hooves, horns and beaks in the fight for last water.</li></ul><h3>Early Access Features</h3><ul><li> The game is based on a sensitive sync of complex skeletons. Each part of the body, when collide with an obstacle, affects the movement according to its proximity to the center of gravity.<br/></li><li> Sound appears through physical interactions. It feels authentic, and I think more surfaces will be added.<br/></li><li> The maps are created procedurally, which allows to change the landscape quickly, which is very useful during work on balance and testing new modes. Ideally, the environment should contain non-obvious paths to victory for each animal.<br/></li><li> Animals not invented, only used. Fourteen species are available: bear, boar, crocodile, crow, deer, eagle, elephant, fox, goat, owl, hippopotamus, lion, rhinoceros, wolf. Their numbers are limited to common sense. This does not mean that new animals will be actively added, but in the future, it will probably be part of a season cycle.<br/></li><li> I look at the simulation as a potential single player mode in which you could create battles, by controlling behavior, training and tune units.<br/></li><li> After obtaining sufficient data, detailed statistics for each species, player ratings, personal statistics, graphs, etc., will be available for all.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T10:38:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2fffd289c83e8e2ddc8a9ef919bca0c.jpg", "website": "http://kozhakov.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 445, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kozhakov"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kozhakov"], "esrb_rating": null}
