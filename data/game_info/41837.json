It is difficult, harking back to a similar era of games, but you\u2019ll find yourself motivated to carry on by the sheer litany of puns and references.\u00a0\" (<strong>BigBossBattle</strong>)<br/></p>\n<p>\"Funky music, varied locales, lovely pixel art, appropriately cheesy voice acting and a story full of twists and turns one simply has to experience to believe. Were I to simply tell the tale of what Captain Disaster in: Death Has A Million Stomping Boots experienced, chances are most would think me absolutely mad.\" (<strong>Wraithkal</strong>)</p>\n<p><strong>What players have said:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\"An hilarious and fun to play spacefaring adventure, full of clever ideas and puzzles of all sorts\"\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"A fun successor to games like Space Quest with references and jokes aplenty and a lighthearted atmosphere that doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest. Had a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles and meeting all the bizarre characters.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"If you have a fondness for planet-hopping sci-fi TV shows and movies of yesteryear, and you also like the idea of guiding a bumbling buffoon through a comedy of errors in deep space, give this game a try.\"\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\"A great game polished to a brilliant sheen over many years of development.<br/>Instant adventure game classic!\"\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\"excellent story with engaging &amp; challenging game play with a lot of subtle social comment &amp; brought to life with humorous voice-acting .....What more can I say!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I found it to be a delightful &amp; engaging game brought to life with an interesting story, humour that I could immediately identify with &amp; pretty good voice acting!\"</p>\n<p>\"A spoof of the space opera genre that actually manages to be THE best space opera I've seen in years. It's quite simply FUN! It's got a memorable cast of aliens, robots and AI's. It's got an epic finale. \"</p>\n<p>\"The jokes, and Captain Disaster himself were really fun to play. \"</p>\n<p>\"It's a very fun game with a great combination of story and mixture of some tributes to movies and games!\"</p>\n<p>\"It's Captain Disaster, a zany, outlandish comedy game that never fails to amuse. Gameplay is not too difficult/frustrating, and voice acting I thought was top rate. As a commercial game, I feel like it is a complete package, I only wish it were longer.\"<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Reviews here on Itch:</strong></p>\n\n\n\r\nGameplay Footage\r\n(Have tried to avoid any spoilers!!)\r\n\n\n\r\nMight want to avoid this one if strobe lighting causes you difficulties.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-21T14:31:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cf/3cf50505b3d5ef07e9ed5dbee7f92f28.jpg", "website": "http://www.captaindisasterthecomputergame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 388, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adventure Game Studio", "CaptainD"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Adventure Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
