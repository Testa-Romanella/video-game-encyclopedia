It is about a game dev who's excited to test his new game, unfortunately it's never that easy! The game features 12 levels over 3 distinct worlds. Be warned, not everything is as it seems, to complete this game you will have to think outside the box.</p>\n<p>I done the art and programming. My friend Matharoo\u00a0did an excellent job on the music. And we used SFX assets by Coffee Bat\u00a0as they worked directly in GB Studio!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Z</strong> - Interact, progress dialogue, select menu item</li><li><strong>X</strong> - Jump</li><li><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> - Move</li><li><strong>Enter</strong> - Open in-game men</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T06:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af6/af65aac370d9c86b5289044289052700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JackOatley"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
