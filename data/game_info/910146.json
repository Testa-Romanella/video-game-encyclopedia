The Theme was \"Solitude &amp; the Metaverse.\" <br/><br/>You\u2019re in your room. In this small cramped apartment, the only thing keeping you company is a VR Headset and a new video game whose early access just released to the public. Explore this immersive world as it evolves and updates through time, but watch as this same immersion slowly disconnects you from reality until there is nothing else left. To progress, interact with the different elements of the video game, but be wary of the cues that remind you that it\u2019s healthy to take breaks sometimes.</p>\n<p>The \u201clevel up\u201d challenge is present in two ways. First, there\u2019s the level up that happens when you collect enough coins - a placebo meant to simulate the dopamine-inducing \u201cnumber goes up\u201d mechanics with no real consequences you see in countless games. Second, the game itself is leveling up as you progress, updating during the time you spend in the real world. The real world is also leveling up as you play the game, although not necessarily in a positive way\u2026<br/></p>\n<p>Controls\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move\r\n</li><li>Left click to interact with items\r\n</li><li>Space bar to put on/remove your VR headset\r\n</li><li>P/Esc to pause the game</li></ul>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n</p>\n<p>Created by Team Deep Dive\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Timoth\u00e9 Lafond (Programming, Game Design, Integration)\r\n</li><li>Patricia Becerra (3D Environments and Assets)\r\n</li><li>Iann Mercier (3D Environments and Assets)\r\n</li><li>Xavier Lavoie (2D Assets, UI, Sound Design)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>All visual assets were created by Team Deep Dive except for a few textures that come included in Adobe Substance Painter.\r\n</p>\n<p>Music credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Chants (by Polkavant)\r\n</li><li>Hamartia (by AKMV-18)\r\n</li><li>Melodic Light House (by JSoundsLAB)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>All music was found on Free Music Archive (freemusicarchive.org)\r\n</p>\n<p>Sfx libraries credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>freesound.org\r\n</li><li>soundgator.com\r\n</li><li>zapsplat.com\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Font libraries credits:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>1001fonts.com\r\n</li><li>dafont.com\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T08:23:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca2/ca2efbd9b1cc98dc689226fe0698b6d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GraviTMonkey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
