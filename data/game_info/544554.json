It's like\u00a0TETRIS, but with a \"twist\"!\r\nSnowman Slide\r\nSolve a unique set of levels to help a snowman become a unicorn (of course). All levels are completely randomly generated, which makes this game <strong>my personal favorite.</strong>\r\nDynamole\r\nCan you, an agile mole, escape the exploding cave? Collect worms, dodge lava balls, and outrun explosions (of which there are enough of\u00a0to make you think Michael Bay was involved).\r\nARBF\r\nAlternate Reality Boss Fight! Defeat the boss as fast as you can while using a goofy\u00a0selection of projectiles and hostage items.\u00a0\r\nHexagon\u00a0Tribute\r\nA fast-paced, obviously shameless fan game of Terry Cavanagh's \"Super Hexagon.\" Can you survive all\u00a04 minutes?\r\nConvey\r\nYou have 10 seconds to change everyone's mood. Make everyone happy,\u00a0make everyone sad --\u00a0it's all part of the game.\r\nDESEEDER\r\nPlants have taken over! Destroy ALL of the seeds in this tightly balanced horizontal flight shooter.\r\nHuman Apocalypse\r\nYou're a zombie being overrun by humans (and ironically I\u00a0guess you have the only pea shooter\u00a0in the world). How many days can you survive? How many days can you put up with the humans having the same 5 voice lines?\r\nI'd Change the World for You\r\nTransform the world around you to reunite with your loved one in this cute casual platformer.\r\nLab Lights\r\nThe power is out! Find a way to turn on all of the lights in this lab-themed puzzle game.\r\nStr1ngle\r\nDestroy the sharp stars with your wrecking ball, and avoid getting the cord cut. Collect powerups and survive 9 waves of mayhem!\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nContact\r\n<p>Reach me via the official\u00a0Discord, by email, or on the discussion boards below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T04:37:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4a/a4ae41c0ac78b2cdd6c316e60c98bc3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zanzlanz"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
