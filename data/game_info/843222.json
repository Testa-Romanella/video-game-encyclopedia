This project follows the theme of the game jam which is \"you are not alone\". In this 2D platformer, you must get through the room by solving puzzles using your player. You can release his shadow from his body and use it to reach levers that the player himself cannot. The player can only interact with\u00a0 switches and in one case, a computer, and the shadow can interact with levers and keys, and a few other interactable objects like one wall, etc. The shadow will be destroyed and forced to return to the player if it goes too close to strong lights, and the player needs to turn those off before you can proceed.</p>\n<p>This game was made by Raasiq Shaikh, Suhas Aditya and Abhilasha Rohi.
