In China and many other East and  Southeast Asian countries, the Mid-Autumn or Moon Festival takes place  when the moon is at its fullest and brightest celebrating the end of the  harvest.  \r\n</p>\n<p>One small town in China is known across the country  for their wonderful display. On this night, when the moon is at its  fullest, a portal opens releasing mischevious phantoms into the human  world. They are scared away by fabulous light displays while cranes  filled with moonlight are released to restore the light to the moon and  close the portal.  \r\n</p>\n<p>Little do the people know, the spirits dancing across the sky are not puppets and kites. They are real.  \r\n</p>\n<p>As  one of the festival organisers, it is your job to keep the phantoms  from ruining the festival whilst putting on a fabulous show!  \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T12:34:31", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ciaranw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
