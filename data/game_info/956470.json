I am at the moment making some custom maps that will look better than the autogenerated but im keeping both sorts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d2/9d25a93015ce44670121f2318e5691ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hiphopy"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
