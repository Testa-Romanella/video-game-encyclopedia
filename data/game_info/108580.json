This chronicle, known only to man as the <em>Kojiki</em>, regales the tale of Izanagi and Izanami, the once-married divine beings whose divorce brought one to the pits of hell. Izanami swore to bring destruction upon humanity as she rotted, and Izanagi resolutely swore to forever protect the Earth. It is now 21xx, and Earth is in a predicament. Izanami has returned, and has summoned the comet 5454 Kojiki to wipe out all existence, once and for all. You must take up the mantle of Izanagi\u2014can you save the Earth from its demise?</p>\n<p>Balance your health in this fighter that turns conventions on their heads. <em>Kojiki54%</em> takes place in a Shibuya many years from now\u2014two Gods of old fight to decide the fate of the world, both determined to sway humanity in their favor.   </p>\n<p>Players are required to expend either <em>Yin </em>or <em>Yang</em> in order to perform actions such as attacks, blocks, and dodges. The goal is to deplete both the <em>Yin</em> and the <em>Yang</em> energies of the opponent in order to win. Light attacks targets the opponent\u2019s <em>Yin </em>(blue), converting portions into <em>Yang</em> (red). A single, successful heavy attack depletes all of the opponent\u2019s <em>Yang</em>. Thus, careful management between the player\u2019s two forces must be maintained in order to achieve success.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>We are a capstone team of four graduating from Sheridan's Bachelor of Game\u00a0Design.</p>\n<p>Our members:</p>\n<ul><li>Andrew Guan (\u00a0@ahnchanart\u00a0 || https://ahnchanart.artstation.com/)<ul><li>3D Environment Artist/Lighter/VFX Artist</li></ul></li><li>Ana Carpio (\u00a0@anaCGandstuff\u00a0)<ul><li>3D Character Artist</li></ul></li><li>Joy Sun (\u00a0@zhuwosun\u00a0)<ul><li>2D Art</li></ul></li><li>Miko Sramek (@mikoggsramek\u00a0 || https://mikosramek.itch.io/)<ul><li>Programming</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>All sound was graciously composed by two great Sheridan\u00a0MASSIVE Students:</p>\n<ul><li>Ryan Maxwell (http://ryanmaxwellcomposer.com/)</li><li>Patrick Flattery (https://www.behance.net/pflattea26)</li></ul>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>Game is optimized for controller play, but keyboard controls do exist.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Tutorial is single-player, but main game is a Versus mode between two human players.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a30a3feb32d4859be7f86ad5b7cd429.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atomic Space Frogs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
