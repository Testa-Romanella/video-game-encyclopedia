Originally built around 550 BCE by the Lydian King Croesus, the Temple of Artemis was more than double the size of other Greek temples. Even the world-famous Parthenon, at 228 by 101 feet, paled in comparison to the Temple of Artemis\u2019 dimensions of 425 by 225 feet. The temple\u2019s immense length and width are not its only unique feature. Arguably the most intriguing part of the building is the massive Ionic columns. The Temple of Artemis boasts 127 columns in total, with two rows of columns on each side of the building. Each of these columns are a staggering 60 feet tall and 4 feet wide. Walking amongst these rows of columns was said to invoke the feeling that you are in a \u201cforest of columns\u201d. The layout of the columns only served to increase this feeling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Explore a model of this Temple that I have created in Blender and put into Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:47:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4b/f4b1fe06e41440433b2a93c9fae6525b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phurst"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
