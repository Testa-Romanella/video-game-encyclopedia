In the Age of Sail, proper positioning is of the utmost importance. Gain the weather gage, sustain powerful broadsides, and anticipate the lumbering movement of enemy ships-of-the-line.

Your hardy sea infantry can board vessels, conduct landing operations, and join land forces in assaulting enemy batteries and other fortifications. Manage cover, positioning, and morale to lead your forces to victory!<br/><br/><strong>LAND BATTLES</strong><br/>Control of the seas is only half the battle. Whether on the New World, Venerable Europe, or the many island in-between, once the war at sea is over, an invasion must commence. Take control of more traditional national armies to combat your enemies on land in major campaigns and where your small force of marines will not do.<br/><br/><strong>BUILD YOUR FLEET</strong><br/>Success on the high seas will earn you promotions.
