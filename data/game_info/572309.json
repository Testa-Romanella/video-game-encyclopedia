Seek revenge against the fool who did this to you.</p>\n\n<p>Octorogue is played as a classic roguelike, but you have tentacles to interact with your environment. Throw items recklessly! Consume everything in your sight! Topple over your enemies like dominos! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Some tips:</strong><br/></p>\n<p> At level 1 you are quite fragile, make sure to keep your distance and avoid tanking hits right away. The boss appears at dungeon level 3, and he's a bit tough to beat. Make sure you bring a dagger or a sword if you can find one to stand a chance against him.<br/><br/>Press ? for help in game for how to play.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/><br/>The font is APL385, in the public domain.
