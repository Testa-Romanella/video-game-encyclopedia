You only have 10 seconds to find the right button or everything will explode. But beware, there is only one correct switch, and any wrong decision will lead you to\u2026 <strong>BOOM</strong>! <br/> Use your mouse to interact with the console. When you hover a button, it may react in three different ways:</p>\n<ul><li>a \u201c<strong><em>bzzz</em></strong>\u201d sound can be heard</li><li>a camera shake can occur</li><li>the control panel text can change.</li></ul><p>Find the only switch that has those three behaviors among the other fake ones. Continue to succeed to score the remaining time until you fail.</p>\n<p><strong>K-Boom</strong> was made in 24h as a Gamejam with Phaser in JavaScript.</p>Team<ul><li><strong>Maude \"<em>Maudster</em>\" L'Hoir</strong>\u00a0: 2D art</li><li><strong>Wendy \"<em>Shadowsun</em>\" Broeckx</strong>\u00a0: Dev</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c9b703b7195b0ea67cba5c87abfbc17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wendy Shadowsun", "Onanagro Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
