Destroy the targets before you are overrun! Can you reach level 6? Can you score more than 100,000 points? How long can you survive?</p>\n<p>Made for the Kenney Jam 2021 (topic: 'rotation'). My first game jam (and first game on itch.io) ever!<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\nDestroy the targets!\r\n<p>Aim your <strong>rotating crosshair</strong> on the <strong>targets</strong>. In order to destroy the targets, <strong>your crosshair must be aligned with them</strong>. Plan your route ahead so you don't lose time waiting! Reach higher and higher levels that demand you to act quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>The targets lose value over time</strong> and turn dark, so make sure you get them fast to improve your score!<br/></p>\r\n\r\nDon't get overrun!\r\n<p>If too many targets are on the screen at once, you will get a <strong>strike</strong>.</p><p><strong>Get three strikes and it's game over!</strong></p>\r\n\r\nGet out of trouble \u2014 LOCK!\r\n<p>If you are lucky enough, a <strong>powerup</strong> will appear. Use it when you get in trouble. <strong>It will lock the shapes in place</strong> for a brief moment, allowing you to get some breathing room.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move your mouse to aim the crosshair.<br/></p>\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<p>I know about them, but I was too lazy fixing them before the jam deadline :p</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a target spawns under awkwardly under the crosshair or under another target, make sure to move the crosshair away and back again in order to 'activate' the crosshair and destroy the target.</li>\n<li>Sometimes more than five targets can appear on the screen. This should not happen, as having six or more targets in the game at once should give you a strike.</li>\n</ul>\r\nSource code available\r\n<p>The game was made using the Godot engine. You can download the entire project in a .ZIP file. Beware: I put a lot of effort into making the game look nice, but the same cannot be said about the scripts :D. It was rushed and I ended up with a lot of spaghetti code. However, I might get back to it, organize it better and add comments...</p>\r\nSuggested modifications\r\n<p>If you want to play around with the game in Godot, I suggest trying out various design changes and observing how they influence the gameplay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boost: make the crosshair move faster</li>\n<ul>\n<li>By pressing a mouse button</li>\n<li>When the crosshair is moving</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Control: allow user to control the rotation</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Left click to rotate left, right click to rotate right</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Targets: add some variety to the targets</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Movement: random, avoiding the player, teleporting</li>\n<li>Timed: player gets a strike if he does not eliminate the target in time</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Powerups, enemies</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Clear all targets on screen</li>\n<li>Crosshair rotation boost</li>\n<li>Mines</li>\n<li>'Homing' mines</li>\n<li>Inverted controls</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T14:39:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/438/43898e83d8c3c4e8c1e370e4bfacc85b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["quax"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
