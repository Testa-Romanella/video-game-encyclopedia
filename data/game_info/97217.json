Home can mean many things to many people. To the designers, home didn't have a single place but rather, the meanings that a group of people give to a place. We looked for an interesting nomadic home, and what came to mind was a traveling circus: a place where the people aren't related, but are still a family. A place that is home, no matter where in the world it is. While researching, we where inspired by the story of Adolf Althoff, a circus owner who used his circus to shelter people during world war 2. While this story is not an exact retelling, we drew inspiration from the people that he helped and what that circus must have been for them, in the chaotic time of war. This was our inspiration for the feeling of 'home'.</p><p><strong>Contributors:</strong></p><p><strong>Design</strong></p><ul><li>Carlos Melo </li><li>Gareth Haage </li></ul><p><strong>Programing</strong></p><ul><li>Gareth Haage</li><li>Carlos Melo </li><li>Eli Deeth </li></ul><p><strong>Art</strong></p><ul><li>Carlos Melo </li><li>Hamish Standfield (Animator)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/188/1880267ec94c2b7776d7cf21f13ede68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CarlosStuff"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
