In order to create this game, I first wondered: \u00ab What is a video game? \u00bb, \u00ab What makes a video game? \u00bb, and above all \u00ab When does the game truly start? \u00bb.</p><p>PYOGON is a game, which is not actually one. On purpose, I only did the game's interface, which allows the player to create his/her own video game. <br/></p><p><strong>Install Instructions</strong><br/></p><p>Open the zip folder and click on the index file.
