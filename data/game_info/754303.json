I need some feedback on them and on what i have so far.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>The player spawns in with 2 weapons that u can switch between with your scroll wheel. Each weapon has its own ability which is bound to q and you can find out for your self. If you jump alongside a white wall you can run over it giving you a movement boost and keeping you from falling. Sprint with shift, jump/doublejump with space. U can crouch/slide bound to ctrl and that was mostly it.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<p>As this is just a rough prototype there are a lot of issues that still need to be fixed. Firstly the main menu is just a bit buggy and still shows the in game ui. Once the player dies the ui shows that it has 0 ammo, the player can switch weapons to show the correct numbers again. The wallrun sometimes just stops working mid run. The player can slide while falling, which means they effectivly have a third jump.\u00a0Sliding can change the ground friction when done sliding. And overall it stutters a lot and is quite inconsistent.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T15:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d813ed32515e560f4afd94e2509402c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OwenPaapie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
