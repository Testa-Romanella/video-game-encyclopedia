You look like you could use a little chill out time, and what better way to chill than fishing side by side with cute and funny cats, you know\u2026 because cats love fish, right?<br/><br/>But watch out, fishing isn\u2019t always as relaxing as you might think. These things can really put up a struggle when they're fighting for their lives. Although these cats won\u2019t be eating them...because they're vegan of course! (let\u2019s save the environment and all that stuff). Instead, you\u2019ll help them complete an amazing fish collection so you can brag about it to your friends.<br/><br/>There are tons of different fish to collect! But keep a keen eye out because some of them only appear in certain types of weather, so it might be a good idea to keep track of the weather report, that way you can choose the right kind of bait to lure in the fish you need to complete the collection.<br/><br/>So let\u2019s gear up and catch all those slippery little fish before they get away!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>Gear up, wait for a fish to bite and reel it in playing a fun minigame. They will struggle for sure, so you better be on your game, otherwise, you could lose the fish and maybe even your equipment. Earn experience, level up, unlock stuff and complete your fish collection!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T04:26:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44a/44a28af8267b16373bb5d35e9deb88e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["NeverEnding Media S. de R.L., C.V."], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Never Ending Media, S. de R.L., C.V"], "esrb_rating": null}
