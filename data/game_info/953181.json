I chose this song because I believe it is the best love song of all time and it acts as streetlights to me.\u00a0Move around to explore more about this songe. Here's the lyrics:</p>\n<p>\"Just before our love got lost you said<br/>'I am as constant as a northern star'<br/>And I said 'Constantly in the darkness<br/>Where's that at?<br/>If you want me I'll be in the bar'<br/><br/>On the back of a cartoon coaster<br/>In the blue TV screen light<br/>I drew a map of Canada<br/>Oh Canada<br/>With your face sketched on it twice<br/>Oh you're in my blood like holy wine<br/>You taste so bitter and so sweet<br/><br/>Oh I could drink a case of you darling<br/>Still I'd be on my feet<br/>oh I would still be on my feet<br/><br/>Oh I am a lonely painter<br/>I live in a box of paints<br/>I'm frightened by the devil<br/>And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid<br/><br/>I remember that time you told me you said<br/>'Love is touching souls'<br/>Surely you touched mine<br/>'Cause part of you pours out of me<br/>In these lines from time to time<br/>Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine<br/>You taste so bitter and so sweet<br/><br/>Oh I could drink a case of you darling<br/>And I would still be on my feet<br/>I would still be on my feet<br/><br/>I met a woman<br/>She had a mouth like yours<br/>She knew your life<br/>She knew your devils and your deeds<br/>And she said<br/>'Go to him, stay with him if you can<br/>But be prepared to bleed'<br/><br/>Oh but you are in my blood<br/>You're my holy wine<br/>You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet<br/><br/>Oh, I could drink a case of you darling<br/>Still I'd be on my feet<br/>I would still be on my feet.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T13:11:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b73/b731a1ef249e93b27ffd4a0f4d8eb2d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Annie Yang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
