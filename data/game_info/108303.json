And plants.</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>There are a lot of love stories out there. This is another like those. Nothing special about it. Maybe a little special, but that is up to you to decide. Every story seems to look the same from afar, but when looked up close, they all seem unique. <br/></p>\n<p>Like this girl, after all. <br/></p>\n<p>I was never good at having care of plants. I think I'm not just one of those people. So when I actually got this little present from someone special, I knew I had to take care of it. And maybe learn how to grow to love someone, too. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>Lasts about 15 minutes, and has 3 unlockable endings.</p>\n<p>Hope you will enjoy it. <br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82a/82ac7d3aac7a29e59d2bd6d4cbee3ce3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["fullmontis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
