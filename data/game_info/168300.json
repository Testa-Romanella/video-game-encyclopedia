I made it using Unity 5.2 Personal Edition and used some free assets from the Unity Asset Store.</p><p>Note that this is a VR entry but <strong>the Leap Motion sensor should NOT be mounted on the DK2</strong>, instead it should be positioned about 50 cm below and 30 cm ahead of the DK2. You may feel that you real hand has an offset to the virtual hand, but I felt that this doesn't disturb the experience. Please let me know if you feel otherwise.</p><p>You can recenter the camera any time by pressing the space bar.</p><p>To control the ship use the two sticks. <strong>Be gentle with the movements</strong> until you get the hang of it! :)</p><p>Left stick vertical axis: Move forward / backward.<br/>Left stick horizontal axis: Strafe left / right.<br/>Right stick vertical axis: Pitch up / down.<br/>Right stick horizontal axis: Yaw left / right.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af9/af9d444695dee299b75f7aee8e3cab4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FredZvt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
