I wanted to do something asymetrical, with one player using the mouse, and the other using the arrow keys. At some point I decided to digitally paint the levels, and that's why there are only three including the tutorial.</p><p>I'm actually still really proud of this project, even though it's very broken in a lot of ways. It's definitely the most work I've ever put into a digital game.</p><p>This was my chance to collaborate with the tallented Artem Bank, he made a lot more songs than actually made it into the final game, and you can listen to the whole soundtrack on his Bandcamp.</p><p>Let me know if you play this one, and let me know who you played against! You can contact me on twitter @metalsnail or on My Tumblr. </p>CHEATS:<ul><li>Click on the Os in \"Kayla Loves Mushrooms\" to view gameplay modes that didn't make it into the final game.</li><li>Type G to activate gibs and N to turn them off.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d2a3b18e20c297291ad21e7cf15bb94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["metalsnail"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
