{"id": 737298, "slug": "bishop-chapter", "name": "Bishop Chapter", "name_original": "Bishop Chapter", "description": "<p>An indie puzzle game I worked on for a final project for University. Inspired by games like Myst and The Witness, this game drops you in a mysterious environment leaving it up to you, the player, to work out how to proceed.</p>\n<p>Set within the world of the Meridian Six / The Black Mist comics, you take on the role of an unnamed individual, finding yourself locked inside a jail cell. You must then undergo several trials in order to collect trophies that will allow escape through the main gates of an outpost known as Bishop Chapter.</p>\n<p>Free to download, but donations welcome. I may or may not work more on this game in the future. Check out my blog for any updates as time goes on.</p>\n<p>I spent around three months working casually on the design and foundations of the game, and then two months of almost full-time development, implementing each puzzle and modelling the assets needed. Full documentation can be found from the main link tree.</p>\n<p>There is a quick feedback form on the Main\u00a0Menu, limited to just 25 submissions in the current build. Any thoughts and comments are highly welcome and encouraged.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game!</p>\n<p>KNOWN BUG LIST:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes the Aten lights can trigger success even when pointed the wrong way.
