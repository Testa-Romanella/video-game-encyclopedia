I received a brief for a proposed game, and was tasked with exploring the technical feasibility of some of the core mechanics. The mechanic I chose was Local and Online Multiplayer. This required me to implement local play, so up to 4 people can play on keyboard/controllers. I also had to implement\u00a0online multiplayer where up to 4 people can connect remotely and play together as long as they all have a copy of it.</p>\n<p>Download it and give it a try with a few mates, let me know what you think and tell me your high-scores!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec9021b441e3222b7a3ac7bc0d55a1e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Lister"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
