The player is a fighter against their will in an important gladiatorial event that takes place only once every 10 years in what is one of the largest remaining cities.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T06:35:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a0/2a04735b8fdc7e890f77d6e60d668284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chazzwazzler", "Superporkchops \ud83d\udc9b"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
