You then have a coaxial machine gun in which can shoot fowards or backwards, depending on what \"gear\" it's in. The way to play is mostly by constantly moving, certain enemies are difficult to deal with if you try to just shoot them, only by changing gear and back pedalling can you really beat it.</p>\n<p>It's not too hard of a game, the learning curve is mostly about learning how to control the tank effectivly. <br/></p>\n<p>I have used Paint Tools.sai to create all of the sprite work, the sounds I have gotten off royalty free websites and finally the music was created by TeknoAxe (youtube or spotify him, he's exetremly diverse). It was created in Game Maker Studio 2 too!.</p>\n<p>Have fun!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/867/867ce37b6401ed03bc1a7157492ce49a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["malcoball"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
