(If you're not familiar, you'll\u00a0probably want to educate yourself: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent%27s_Revenge)</p><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>As a pig farmer, you understand that the demand for bacon is on the rise, but your formerly\u00a0fine hogs have turned against you, itching to trample you at a moment's notice! Fortunately,\u00a0you came up with a pretty ingenious way to corral them, using your ready supply of hay bales.\u00a0(Because what else do you do when you're a farmer??)</p><p>Just push the hay bales around a bit to blockade the pigs until they can't move. Once you've\u00a0caught them all, it's bacon time!</p><p>Clever farmer that you are, that's not the only trick up your sleeve - you also invested in a large\u00a0straw hat. Why? To evade the pigs' evil stampede, you conceal yourself with it, because it looks\u00a0a bit like a hay bale and the pigs can't tell the difference! (They're not very bright.)</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Move - Arrow keys, WASD, or numpad (numpad let's you move on diagonals, which can be\u00a0pretty handy)</p><p>Hide - Space</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>When you're under your hat, you're hidden from the view of the pigs. It's pretty funny-looking\u00a0too. Try it! :)</p><p>Leave the Console tab in FireBug/Developer Tools open while you play, just for fun. ;)</p><p><strong>Other Notes</strong></p><p>Works best in Firefox and/or on a large screen. You may want to zoom out on the page if it\u00a0doesn't all fit.</p><p>There are currently four levels, where each level spawns three rounds of pigs before proceeding\u00a0to the next. I made the first three levels in increasing difficulty, and a fourth that was intended to\u00a0be the last level. Some additional levels would have made the sudden change in difficulty less\u00a0drastic.</p><p>When you die, refresh the page to start over.</p><p>All the bacon must be gone before proceeding to the next level. If you cannot eat the bacon, you\u00a0must squish it with a hay bale instead, otherwise you will not be able to proceed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MyFarms Game Jam II"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
