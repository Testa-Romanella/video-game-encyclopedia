Inspired by Grimms' Fairytales and the haunting music of Emily Portman, <em>The Hollow Girls</em> seeks to unsettle... and delight.</p>\n<p>What you see here is a prototype, but I'd be interested in building on it in the future (should the game garner enough interest). If you decide to download and play it, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
