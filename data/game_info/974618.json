Try a few games and, if you like one of them (or more!), join the community to discuss what is about a particular title that catches your eye, leave feedback, interact with like-minded players and help us decide which games to make.<br/><br/><br/>The current version of the Bossa Presents Launcher has four playable prototypes: Room of Doom, Trash Bandits, World War AI and I Am Fish - which has now been published as a full title thanks to feedback from players who tried the original prototype and wanted to see it made into a full game (available here on Steam!)<br/><br/><br/>The launcher also includes concept pages for potential upcoming prototypes. Find out more about the likes of Project Meru, Darkseekers, The Few and They Come at Night, and leave your thoughts and feedback on the game concepts. Should we make a playable version of any of them? That\u2019s up to you! We\u2019re here to listen to your opinions and ideas.<br/><br/>As new prototypes are added, your Launcher will automatically feature the new titles, bringing you as close as it gets to the action of developing games.
