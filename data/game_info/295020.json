Choices open up (or close off) mission opportunities, areas to explore, story arcs, and lots of other content.</p>\n<p>Your Ranger Base is a core part of the experience. As you help the local people and establish a reputation in Colorado, quests and narrative will force you to make decisions on how to lead.</p>\n<p>The game will be set in the savage lands of frozen Colorado, where survival is difficult and a happy outcome is never guaranteed. Players will face difficult moral choices and make sacrifices that will change the game world.</p>\n<p>Wasteland 3 will feature a deep and engaging story utilizing a newly-revamped dialog tree system from the celebrated writers of Torment: Tides of Numenera.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-05T20:43:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/370/370a4cbcfa75e5238ee8f74bf323694d.jpg", "website": "https://www.inxile-entertainment.com/wasteland3", "rating": 4.06, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 158, "owned": 1760, "beaten": 154, "toplay": 279, "dropped": 119, "playing": 41}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 211, "ratings_count": 273, "suggestions_count": 662, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 280, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "macOS", "PC", "Linux", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["InXile Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver", "inXile Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
