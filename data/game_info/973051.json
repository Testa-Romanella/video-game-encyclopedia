{"id": 973051, "slug": "infected-outpost", "name": "Infected: Outpost", "name_original": "Infected: Outpost", "description": "<h3>SUMMARY</h3><br/><strong>INFECTED: OUTPOST</strong> is a 2-12 player social deduction horror game inspired by The Thing, which will test your wits and teamwork. You and your friends are stranded and must work together to escape. However, one of you is infected, and they can shapeshift into their victims. Gather resources, uncover the traitor, and race against time for a thrilling and heart-pounding experience. Will you work together to survive, or will you succumb to the infection?<h3>PLAYERS AND NPCs</h3><br/>Each map has a set number of characters. Each character is controlled by either a player or an NPC. To blend in with the NPCs, remember that they walk in straight lines, and cannot run or pick up items.<h3>HOW TO WIN</h3><br/><strong>HUMANS</strong><br/>DISINFECTION: Kill the infected player.<br/>ESCAPE: At least one human player escapes the outpost. Each extract has different requirements for fuel, keys, and maps. <br/><br/><br/><strong>INFECTED</strong><br/>ASSIMILATION: Kill all human players.<br/>GENERATOR SHUTDOWN: The generator timer reaches zero and the humans freeze to death and the infected wins. Prevent the humans from increasing the time by refueling the generator.<h3>TIPS</h3><br/>- The Infected is an alien threat that shapeshifts into its victims.<br/>- The only way to tell if someone is infected is if they cannot shoot the gun.<br/>- The Infected cannot attack while holding an item.<br/>- Items such as keys, flares, fuel, and weapons are randomly placed in chests across the map.<br/>- When you run, your footsteps will be heard. NPCs don't run. Try to blend in.<br/>- When you die, you can spectate the game. Use A and D to switch between players.<br/>- We recommend using any VOIP program to communicate with other players.<h3>RULES</h3><br/><strong>- Don't talk when you're dead.</strong><h3>FUTURE CONTENT</h3>Even after the release of Infected: Outpost, we plan to add even more content to the game, but this will only be possible with enough support from you guys &lt;3<br/>- The return of proximity chat.<br/>- More game modes.<br/>- More maps based on other classic horror films (Alien, The Descent, I Am Legend, and more!) with their own unique items, objectives, and twists on the gameplay.<br/>- Randomized skills and weaknesses for the Infected.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T06:05:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33bcfe4dd09be3e80b9fc8666c09e7f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spacezero Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spacezero Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
