As you might have understood, this mini game is a fan game. This game and its creators are not affiliated with Marvel nor other license holders. This game has not received the approval of Marvel (yet?). We just want to show them that, somewhere, people with talent are just waiting for them to make a full game out of their awesome Universe.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor this to happen we'll need your help. Help us to make this real by spreading the word on Twitter, Facebook or any other media and tell how much you would love to play the full game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is just a tiny bit of what we'd love to do, but we hope you will enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\n\r\nJUST A PROTOTYPE\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat's in:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Playable captain America</li>\n<li>Autonomous Ultron sentries</li>\n<li>Wave of enemies</li>\n<li>Love we have for the Marvel Universe</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tWhat's not in (but we'd love to do if we're allowed to):\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Tons of Marvel characters</li>\n<li>Real level design (level progression + boss)</li>\n<li>Several levels</li>\n<li>Local multiplayer</li>\n<li>Sounds and Music</li>\n<li>Grab and throw</li>\n<li>Complex AI</li>\n<li>Special attack 2</li>\n<li>Run and attack</li>\n<li>Gamepad support</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\n\r\nMAKING OF\r\n<p>\r\n\tTime-lapse of the programming side, made by \r\n\tLaurent.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\r\nORIGINAL MOCKUPS\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhere everything began, made by \r\n\tRaymond.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/572c515f1bd8771b676f56c534c8eb14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Laurent Victorino"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
