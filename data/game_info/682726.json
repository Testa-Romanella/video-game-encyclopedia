It is an experiment in making progressive, empowering games and an escape from personal development.<br/>\nIt involves retiring from life and walking the streets of the city, a series of virtual walks. It requires you to choose each walk by hand. You can choose the details of your walk and decide on the size and direction of your walk. The game world is based on real life world. You will get to choose your own option, whether you want to walk the streets of Madrid, Barcelona or Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIt is inspired by typography and that it is not easily done in software. And we want you to create your own experience with this game and fall in love with it. This game is also made for friends to bring their friends and family.\n\nThis game is not popular in any traditional medium. This game is not found in magazines or on the market on the internet. But it is available for everything.\n\nThere are a lot of games that are creating a big impact on the world. We covered some of them here in 2013. We know you will download them, share them, move them around and build them even more.\n\nWe are sorry that we can't offer them for sale in the stores even if we were to spawn a whole full-life. However we are willing to make another game because it is so important to us. It is not a game for us.\n\nWe want to bring you this game, work on it and enjoy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:39:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e0/0e0b58c7bac30a223756b2262f2d96bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
