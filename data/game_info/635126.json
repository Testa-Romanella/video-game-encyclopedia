There are 3 Stages, and several Racer customizations to play around with. As of 0.8.6 you can set AI Difficulty in track select.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: <br/></p>\n<p>WSAD - Movement</p><p>Q - Look behind<br/></p>\n<p>SPACE - Use Item, Select, Continue, Exit After Race<br/></p>\n<p>ESC - Return to main menu, Exit Game</p>\n\n<p>Items:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Collect items by picking up Rainbow Gems. You can only hold one Item at a given time.</p>\n<p>Vulcan - Fires a barrage of bullets. Each bullet has little effect but you can score multiple hits.</p>\n<p>Missile - Fires a slow but powerful missile straight ahead.</p>\n<p>Mines - Drops two mines behind your Trike. Each one decreases speed by 1/3.</p>\n<p>Boost - Temporary increase in speed. Will be canceled if you take damage.</p>\n<p>Orbital Strike - Laser fired via GPS Satellite. Hits all opponents regardless of distance. Cuts Speed by half with each hit.</p>\n\n<p>Boost pads: <br/></p>\n<p>Aside from Items there are also Yellow Gems which on contact initializes a nitro boost, increasing your Trike's speed. Mastering the location of these in a map is key to winning.<br/></p>\n<p>Tracks:</p>\n<p>Raceway - A lush green track. Minimal Inclination and light turns. Easy track to learn to play.</p>\n<p>Canyon - A desert Map. Lots of changes in inclination, ramps, choke-points, and water hazards (you loose speed while driving through water). \u00a0Very Technical map for Advanced Racers.</p>\n<p>Magma track - Inside a massive volcano, this is a tracks for EXPERTS ONLY. You can easily fall of the track and never be heard from again. Lots of inclination, sharp turns, and even traps, in this multi-tiered track.</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS/THANKS</p>\n<p>Thanks to SamMhmdy for code to translate to clock format.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Jaime Zebgi for the Move Elastic behavior which was the foundation of my Kart Racer Behavior.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to Cynicmusic for the amazing free to use music.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to my wife who is and always the source of my strength in darkest of times.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T09:49:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15f/15ff988d7b0f07a7919f49d8116ce18b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 329, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ishmaru"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
