{"id": 969272, "slug": "mh-zombie", "name": "MH-Zombie", "name_original": "MH-Zombie", "description": "DISCLAIMER: If you've never flown a real helicopter, never flown a simulated helicopter, or never flown the helicopters in ARMA or Battlefield, this game is very hard, even on the 'Easy' physics mode. However, it's also very rewarding, and if you just keep at it, you really can learn the basics of how to fly a helicopter.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThree flight physics modes, three difficulty modes, and a tutorial mode provide a stepped learning curve and wider accessibility to realistic helicopter flight.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTHE SCENARIO:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe National Laboratory has been studying all kinds of crazy biological \"tools\", and now it's under invasion. If any of that research gets captured, or worse, some sort of vector gets out, it could be the start of a happy new world. For zombies. For us, it would be quite inconvenient.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPerform aerial interdiction against the relentless Commies, using an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of weaponry from your Multi-Role Helicopter (MH), callsign Zombie 26. If zombies were to somehow result from your failure to fight off the invasion, and the zombies were to escape, all hope of containment would be lost, so fly like your life depends on it (SPOILER: It does).<br/>\n<br/>\r\n3 locations, 3 + 1/2 game modes, and a crowd of 36 achievements ranging from easy to very, very difficult will keep you coming back to fly the most realistic arcade helicopter game on Steam.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKNOWN ISSUES:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKeyboard bindings are for English Language layout; some bindings will not work correctly with other-than English keyboard layouts.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs any honest Attack Pilot will tell you, probably less than 1% of the flying includes pulling triggers. 99% of the flying IRL is incredibly boring, and yet also incredibly stressful. If you're looking for the entire Attack Pilot experience, to include the aforementioned, this isn't the game you're looking for. Maybe get the AH-64D expansion for DCS World. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBUT-<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you want to multiply that 1% of awesomeness by 100, with no radio calls to make, no permission to engage to ask for, no pesky aircraft limitations and failures, no deadly quirks of aerodynamics, lightning fast battle-damage repairs, and a whole lot of ammunition to rain down on the enemy, you need look no further.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T06:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f71/f71f15678f1834473e3d29879f5d66ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Raulworks"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Raulworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
