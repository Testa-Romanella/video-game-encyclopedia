There is controller support, as well as an auto save system.<br/></p>\n<p>And if you beat the game and\u00a0want more, be sure to also check out the project over on Kickstarter for more news in the future.<br/><br/><em>UPDATE: I've been requested to make the demo harder. Note that the difficulty has been lowered by design, because it is a demo. That being said, I am considering adding a hard mode. Let me know in the comments (or somewhere else on the internet) if there is more interest for\u00a0that.</em><br/><br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Simply extract the contents of the .zip file to a folder of your choosing\u00a0and run the executable.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T17:32:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa2/aa20a8217154592afd1d5523159463a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HornofBalance"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
