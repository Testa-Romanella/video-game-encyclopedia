This means that every item that you pick up to help you survive makes you move slower and turn more sluggishly. The aim is to find the 4 car components in the level to escape the zombies.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>W,A,S,D - Move<br/>E - Pick up item<br/>Right Click - Punch/Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d0ecf4ec9da48fad04b70b14e83dc19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Unit02Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
