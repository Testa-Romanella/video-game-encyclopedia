The game is set on the man-made island Dejima, which the Japanese government is using to house Western foreigners and where a Christian group is trying to separate from the rest of the country.[1][2] The main character is Gokurakumaru, a violent mercenary and poor womanizer. He travels with his gun-wielding love interest (Oyuri) and sidekick (Togizo). The latter provides comic relief and holds the swords as Gokurakumaru collects them one by one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-20T19:43:05", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Konami Computer Entertainment Japan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
