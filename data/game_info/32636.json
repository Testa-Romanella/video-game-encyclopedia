{"id": 32636, "slug": "street-racer", "name": "Street Racer", "name_original": "Street Racer", "description": "A cross between Super Mario Kart and Street Fighter, Street Racer takes place in a kooky cartoon world with 3-D environments ranging from Mount Rushmore to Transylvania. In split-screen mode, four players can be viewed in different windows simultaneously for a behind-the-car perspective. In micro mode, available for one to four players, all players cars can be seen in an aerial view of whatever track is in play. Different viewing and playback options make it possible to experience every grueling twist, turn and obstacle in your path from varied camera angles and positions, with independent controls for each window in multiplayer modes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdvanced artificial intelligence gives the game s cars the ability to adapt to the player s performance. The better you are, the better they perform, providing unlimited challenge even for the most seasoned racer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStreet Racer features 27 challenging game tracks (three of them hidden), four difficulty levels and eight cartoon opponents with names like Frank Instein, Green Machine and Surf Sister. Each character wields special weapons ranging from towels to the ability to fly, and each also has a special musical theme reflecting his or her personality.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor maximum variety and challenge, the game offers multiple race options ranging from one-lap sudden death races to endurance contests up to 80 laps, plus a choice of four different gameplay modes. These include a practice option where players can test their skills against any driver; a basic Head-to-Head mode for two players racing on one selected track; a Championship mode that allows players to design their own race, mixing tracks and difficulty levels if desired; and a Rumble mode that lets you knock your opponents out of the ring.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpeeds of up to 30 frames per second on the DX266 and up to 60 frames per second on Pentium machines offer exceptional detail, even in four-player mode. There are also 10 different fast starts for players to explore and built-in fast laps on each track for drivers to beat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is also packed with special surprises, including hidden tracks and characters, and bonus points that make it possible to win a race without finishing in first place. Players receive extra points for causing damage to other cars and for finishing a race damage-free. Cars that incur damage are penalized with slower performance. Repair kits available along the track can reverse the damage. And turbo boosts that can be picked up along the way provide short bursts of super-speed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-11T19:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/154/1548b80d93775b5a3bf231ff48108399.jpg", "website": "http://pikointeractive.com", "rating": 3.8, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Game Boy", "PlayStation", "SNES", "SEGA Saturn", "Genesis", "PC"], "developers": ["Vivid Image"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment", "Piko Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
