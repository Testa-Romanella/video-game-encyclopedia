Once you got there, however, you realized it was much more inhabited than you had expected, with ice slimes being created by the weather. Your goal is now to survive for as long as possible, making sure you don't freeze in the frigid conditions.</p><p>Gameplay</p><p>Kill the slimes by shooting them with fireballs[left click], or fly around the planet using your fire funnels[right click]. Be mindful of your chill meter, which increases when in frozen(white) areas of the planet, and decreases when in warmed up(green) areas of the planet. You can warm up areas by hitting them with your fireball, but they can be frozen over again by the slimes touching them.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>WASD - movement</p><p>Space - jump</p><p>Left Click: shoot fireball</p><p>Right Click: Fire funnel</p><p><strong>Known issues</strong>:</p><p>Sometimes when you restart after dying, it is possible that it doesn't restart properly, this is a weird issue that I couldn't seem to fix with the version of godot I'm using(guess this is why you shouldn't use betas for actual games lmao), if this happens just alt-f4 out of the game and reopen it if you wish to continue.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:40:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf7cfa547a184127858871a1d442c64c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fossinating"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
