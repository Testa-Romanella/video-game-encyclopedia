Take a minigolf course, freeze it and let animals slip in form of small pucks to hit the bullseye.<br/><br/>* Swipe the puck while moving *<br/><br/>The difference to miniature golf is that, in Purrling you can influence the direction of the puck as it moves. Is it too far left? No problem. A small wiper or swipe and the direction is just perfect.<br/><br/>* One shot - one hit *<br/><br/>Where is the difficulty? Just like curling, you have ONE try!
