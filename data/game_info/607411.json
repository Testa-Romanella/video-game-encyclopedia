Paving the way for future installments, this single screen puzzle platformer impressed with its high quality graphics and mind-twisting levels.<br/></li><li><strong>Retro KING MAN</strong><br/>Released in 1990, Retro KING MAN changed the gameplay quite a bit, as players could explore large maps to find upgrades for the KING MAN.

The game was groundbreaking for its full-screen pixelation effects, the use of widescreen and iconic voice acting.</li></ul><br/>Rounding out this spectacular package is a documentary about the full history of the series, how it started and how it all fell apart. Experience and enjoy these wonderful classics from an era that never was for the first time since their original release and dive into the world of the KING MAN - metaphorically, of course.<br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>Controller Information:<br/>This game is compatible with a wide range of gamepads. However, due to limitations with the engine, some controllers may not work properly. There is, unfortunately, nothing I can do about that.
