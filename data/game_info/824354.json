Try everything.</p>\n<p>Your cane will turn around when you mouse over something clickable, or turn into footy-prints when you mouse over a place to go, or turn into a dart when you're centred on your target.</p>\n<p>On the bottom right it shows what you have in your hand - depending on what you have in your hand, you can do different things when you click on things.</p>\n<p>Bottom left is options, and at the top right you can click to see what items you have collected - keep in mind that there are two pages to your inventory, and items may be in the second page even if the first page isn't full.</p>\n<p>The game saves whenever you go from one place to another - so for example if you pick up something, then close the tab, you'll have to pick it up again.</p>\n<p>If you get stuck, you can look at the walkthrough, or you can ask me for some cryptic hints - I'll be happy to oblige.\u00a0\ud83e\udd20</p>\n<p>God be with you!</p>\n<p>Your servant,<br/>Patrick</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T13:52:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb4bdedc9b68380813e7f87370c302c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["patrick-lauser"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
