You are the greatest of them all and you are the only that is left. The evil forces have snuffed you out and trapped you inside a ring of death. You must use all of your skills and super powers bestowed upon you to defeat the endless wrath of evil thrown at you. Chain your kills to obtain killer combos. Time your super powers for maximum efficiency. Most importantly each hit you take will drain your energy so keep an eye on your energy meter. Remember each particle killed will restore a portion of your energy. Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d56d879f25359c69c5f6e9ab5109b39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["silentmind.studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
