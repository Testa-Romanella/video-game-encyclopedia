That\u2019s how small-town stories always go, don\u2019t they? <em>Nothing ever happens here.</em> At least, that\u2019s how they should go. But lately, you\u2019ve been stumbling into more mess than you could have ever imagined. Now you\u2019re wondering just how many secrets might be simmering below the surface, deep in the bowels of town, waiting to boil over.\r\n</p>\r\nThe Case:\r\n<p> Brooklynn Windsor-Lowe is missing. <em>Been</em> missing, actually. For a week. You shouldn\u2019t care this much. You haven\u2019t been friendly, much less friends, in a decade. None of your old group has. But she vanished without a trace, and lately you\u2019ve seen Sheriff McDickDuff at the bar more than the station. Someone needs to look out for her. You can\u2019t quite put your finger on it, but there\u2019s a stink about the town (and it isn\u2019t the mystery meat in the cafeteria). Time to take things into your own hands. Tread carefully; you just might make it out alive (and if you\u2019re lucky, in time for curfew).\r\n</p>\n<p>What secrets are hiding in Hallow Cove? Every passing minute takes you a little farther away from Brooklynn, and a little farther away from the truth. Will you discover them in time to save her life?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Your own?\r\n</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T17:33:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d6/7d6ca12fe22c00e8327bcb7f6e78e8b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["K.R.
