Your task is to launch the correct fill at the correct toy to fill it. Don't overfill the toy or it will explode. </p>\n<ul><li>\r\n\tEach toy can only interact with, and be filled by its own filler.</li><li>\r\n\tYou have a limited amount of fill. This requires precision shooting rather than random shooting.</li><li>Plan your moment of launch carefully and then click on the launcher to release the fill.</li><li> The fill is light, it doesn't travel very fast; you have to launch it in time to intercept the toys that are far away.</li><li>\r\n\t50 Unique levels where the toys move in different configurations. Fill them from the top, from the bottom, from the side etc.</li><li>The speed at which the toys move increases every 10 levels.</li><li>Launch the flower to fill a toy up to it's maximum - helpful when you've run out of fill. </li><li>Launch the star to protect a toy, that is in the way, from exploding. </li><li>Catch the bonus items on every level (launch any fill at them to collect them) and keep them until the later levels - you will need them!</li></ul>\n<p>\r\n\tDon't be misguided by the cute graphics, getting gold on all the levels is very challenging.</p>\n<p>This game will take 5 - 6 hours to complete - and many hours to perfect each level.  <br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Fun Fill Factory -  Arcade / Casual Game from Evolutionary Games on Vimeo.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is also available for Android</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>System Requirements:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This game is written in the resolution 1280 x 720 and will be that size if played in window mode on a monitor larger than that.
