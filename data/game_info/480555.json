Scientists worked hard over the\u00a0 centuries to replace\u00a0 limbs and organs with artificial components. Work was done by ever more sophisticated robots with better and better AIs.\u00a0Eventually the whole human body had to be replaced including brains. People's brains had also to be replaced with photonic computers that replaced the human brain, cell for cell and dentrite for dentrite.</p>\n<p>With the ever continuing evolution of both AI robots and human originated androids, the only difference was in the higher level sentimental modes of thought. Externally and even internally they were indistinguishable.</p>\n\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move forward and rotate left/right.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/663/663173ceca0b20ce163636d3b61baf23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["georgebonbon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
