Determined to set a good example for her less disciplined sibling, who often fails to show up to training, Keika visits the village Shinto priest who made the request. This priest tells her of a giant monkey youkai who has led other youkai on a rampage in and around his village. She confidently accepts the request alone, believing that her powers as a priestess would help overcome them...<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>This game features roguelike RPG mechanics, complete with dungeon layouts and enemy battle formations that change on every playthrough.
