After a series of failed expeditions, one solar system, Lumis 07, holds the key to the answer.</p><p>Part interactive-fiction, part dating-sim, and all sci-fi, Pioneer[03] is based on a famous fairy tale from the 10th century.</p><p>This early prototype for the game was written over the course of three weeks for the Nine Worlds 2014 Game Jam and is currently at a very early stage (although the story has been thoroughly laid out).<br/><br/>Although it might seem to have little to do with the original fairy tale, the final release will make everything a lot clearer. I can't really say too much, because... y'know... spoilers...</p><p>I hope you enjoy playing our very early sample and a huge thanks to Nine Worlds for inspiring us to put down working on Pioneer[06] and start working on [03]. It's been a whole lot of fun, hard work, and we look forward to bringing you a complete game as soon as we finish it!</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></p><p><em><strong>We've predominantly been running Pioneer[03] under OSX for the test build, which will then be followed by a windows test build. We currently have not yet begun testing out the Linux version, but we still love you Linux users dearly and hope you'll be patient with us! We've uploaded the linux build which *should* work, but at the moment it's very hit or miss without a dedicated linux box or the time at the moment to test it on...</strong></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bb/9bb626cdf7f2a4a8dee3e222b7e912df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Maki"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
