You and your enemies consume time to stay alive. Damaging creatures will take away time, giving back to the attacker a fraction of it. If someone runs out of time, dies. Your objective is to fight the boss of time to remove the curse from all creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Arrow left, up, right - Shoot</p>\n<p>Arrow down - Slam to the ground</p>\n\n<p>This is my first ever game jam, so I hope everyone will like this game. It might be a bit over the top, but I felt like I had to implement all these features to achieve what I wanted. By the way, sorry for the\u00a0horrible sound effects and the lack of music. It is not my strength and trust me, you don't want to hear the music that I compose.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:25:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e88/e88a230f4fd1c98d0a9f6de80696a260.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Szivacs"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
