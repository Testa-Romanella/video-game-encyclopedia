She\u2019s stuck in a </strong><em><strong>Chaotic Loop!\u00a0</strong></em>\ud83d\ude40</p>\n<p>Every time Chaos Kitty tries to leave a place, she loops back until everything is knocked down. Whenever a new loop begins, she gets less time to knock everything down!\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay\u00a0\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\r\n<p>Knock down as many things as possible within a time limit. You\u2019ll unlock new things to knock down every time Chaos Kitty completes a loop. But be careful! Get caught by an angry human and it\u2019s game over. So try to run away or hide in containers when danger is near.\r\n</p>\r\nHow did we apply the B&amp;W Jam theme \u201cloop\u201d?\u00a0\r\n<p>We interpreted the theme by making the level loop. Every loop, the timer goes down faster and\u00a0new knockable items are unlocked!<br/></p>\r\nHow did we fit the restriction for the B&amp;W Jam?\r\n<p>Chaos Kitty is a black cat in a black and white world.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\u00a0\ud83d\udc3e\r\n<ul><li>Shift or Left Click - Attack and knock down objects</li><li>E - Hide in containers</li><li>A/D or Left/Right Arrow - Move Left/Right</li><li>Spacebar - Jump</li></ul>\r\nBugs\u00a0\ud83d\udc1b\r\n<p>Just some things we couldn't fix before the deadline.</p>\n<ul><li>When players press the pause button, they will also swipe</li><li>Player animations may not play correctly.</li><li>Swipe hitbox is a little funky.
