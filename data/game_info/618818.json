Each puzzle has many solutions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>[Q and E] to rotate the pieces.</p>\n<p>[Y] to restart a puzzle.<br/></p>\n<p>[Space] to advance dialog.\u00a0</p>\n<p>[K] to skip dialog.</p>\n<p><strong>The Story</strong><br/></p>\n<p>An organisation creates compounds in a lab. For nefarious or good intentions who can say. One day happy go-lucky and always hungry (for knowledge and for desserts)\u00a0Cadmia gets a trainee position working in the lab. From now on she will be mentored by the self serious (but secretly sensitive) Murasaki as they work on science experiments together.</p>\n<p><strong>GMTK 2021</strong></p>\n<p>The game has been produced in less than 48 hours for the GTMK GameJam 2021. All 3D renders, art, music, and code was created this weekend, nothing was reused.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Team</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Pretty much all the coding, the\u00a0Puzzle Design, Brainstorming: Zoey.</p>\n<p>Interface Design, Creative Direction, Brainstorming, Script Writing, and a little code: Luna.</p>\n<p>Character Design, Brainstorming, Music Composition: Annie.</p><p>Dev Notes:</p><p>-Some shapes need to be isolated for the level to complete (levels 1,2,3,7,8), shapes for levels 4 and 6\u00a0can have elements outside them but not inside.</p><p>-To beat level 5 (waterfall) you must fill the whole board in exactly 8 moves.</p><p>-A bug with level 2 allows you to complete it with excess elements attached to the goal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:11:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/314a8b61915d5380103fa77d7e790f35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Dead Bunny Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
