Your mission is to reach the final stage and defeat the boss. If that's too easy try to do that without taking any damage!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls &amp; Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>By holding the left mouse button and moving the cursor you are able to move. Each time you release the mouse button you do a little jump.</p>\n<p>If you hold the mouse button long enough you charge energy, which is used for doing the special jump. The more energy you charge, the more damage you do on landing.</p>\n<p>To do special jump charge energy until the bar is at least blue and release mouse while mouse cursor is in the upper area of the screen (arrows will pop up when your cursor is in that area).</p>\n<p>Each time you land on the ground after doing the special jump, you release waves.</p>\n<p>While you are falling, after doing the special jump, you can hold the mouse button to land faster and do additional damage beneath you, on landing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T13:59:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e9/0e90b95f2acabce56b7601655084a4b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Diamond32"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
