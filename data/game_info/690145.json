They die now like malls died decades back, becoming temples to themselves in much the same way. <br/></em></p>\n<p><em>IDEAL Soft R&amp;D - dream visualization researchers who burned a bunch of angel cash in the 90s - had cubicle cops protect their five-story-coffin since a bit after the century flipped. Caught 'em leaving early, though - you and your partner have a couple of nights with the place to yourselves.</em></p>\n<p><em>Inside, what you discover brings you somewhere else entirely.</em></p><p>This is - more or less - a pitch for what that game might play like.  Spent a long time working on these tools for making grid-based audio-puzzle-exploration levels, and, hey, now I've got something to show for it.<br/></p>\n<p>Don't really have a name for this yet, so I'm calling the project \"dream dungeon\", since it's inspired by Yume Nikki, its fangames, and classic grid dungeon crawlers.
