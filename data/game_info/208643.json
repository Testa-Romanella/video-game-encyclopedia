{"id": 208643, "slug": "omega-hunter", "name": "Omega Hunter", "name_original": "Omega Hunter", "description": "<p>Omega Hunter was made for a 1 day game jam a few years back. The jam was called \"Shit Jam\" and the concept was to make something tacky reminiscing old 90's web pages with crappy gifs and word arts.</p><p>We got a few keywords to base our game on. The only one I can remember is 'Omega' and I believe there may also have been something about 'guilt'. Anyways I made this game from scratch in about 8 hours. There were some problems when I uploaded it originally, so I don't think anyone ever played it. I'm just uploading it now; beacuse why not?</p><p>It's a simple game that suits the game jam concept. It only takes a minute to play where you have to hunt as many endangered animals as possible. Enjoy.</p><p>The game's project files can be downloaded from:</p><p>https://github.com/pstudio/omega-hunter<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88a/88a985b781518888ab803fa7e58e51e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pstudio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
