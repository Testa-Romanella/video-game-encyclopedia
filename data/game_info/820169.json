Once you're at the bottom you get the option to either climb up the ladder, or jump again. Considering your score becomes higher the deeper you go it might be tempting to go for another jump, but dying means also you will lose your score! Because the way the saws are placed is random for every jump, there's no way to tell in advance how difficult it will be so you have to \"roll the dice\" and hope for the best. Every jump is a gamble that can make or break your score!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T23:05:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa331f49cce2e3728229c2dc15a6559.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noah"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
