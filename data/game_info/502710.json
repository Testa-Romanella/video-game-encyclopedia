Well, the world of CataGolf is not as peaceful as a regular golf course... exploding pinguins, mines, locked doors and many other hazards are set between you and the sacred flag ! The first lvels are\u00a0 easy, but the game becomes pretty challenging as long as you play !</strong></p>\n<p><strong>100 levels are planned, each having a par and bogey score to unlock more levels and cat/club skins. The full game will be available depending on the success of this preview ;)<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I hope you will enjoy this little sneak peek, and please let me know what you think about this game in the comment section below !
