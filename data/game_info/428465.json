To play you must press the arrows shown on the color coded boxes (get it? C;) to gain points against the wishes of the pesky timer!</p>\n<p>In all seriousness, this game was meant as a test. I wanted to see what could be done with my 'rather limiting' budget of $0 and a free license to Construct 2. In the future I'm willing to update and work on this game more as a learning exercise if I\u00a0feel I\u00a0can learn more from this project and it's continued development is wanted.</p>\n<p>Right now, pretty much everything other than than text is a place-holder, I\u00a0plan to redo many of the sprites with some pixel-art and add music!\u00a0And fix those weird Creative-Commons sounds!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game, Weirdos!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T16:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85eec86353c93bd122b2cad7b6cf0630.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meekro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
