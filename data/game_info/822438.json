However, the dungeon is guarded by a mystical die. Can you help Gill steal all the treasure?\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The object of the game is to move Gill to the treasure chest in each level. However, Gill\u2019s movement is not entirely under your control. You can use the WASD keys to specify a direction to move in, but the die in the lower right of the screen will decide how many squares Gill will move in that direction. But fear not, on most levels, you have the power to switch between different die modes with the Q and E keys to gain an advantage.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There are six different tile types, each which do something different.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Stone - Gill can stand on these tiles safely\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Walls - These tiles will block Gill\u2019s movement\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Pits - Gill will fall to his death if he stands or walks on thes tiles\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Cracked Stone - Gill can walk on these tiles, but will fall to his death if he stands\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 on them\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Ice - Gill will slide off this tile (or line of tiles)\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Treasure Chest - Gill must stand on this tile to win\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0All ten levels can be beaten without dying, regardless of which numbers are rolled. The trick is finding the right path and die modes.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0WASD - Move in a direction\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Q / E - Switch die modes\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0R - Reset level\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0L - Skip level\r\n</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 M - Mute music</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This game (including art and music) was made in under 48 hours for the GMTK 2022 Game Jam, there will doubtless be many bugs *aghem*\u00a0features,\u00a0for which I apologies.
