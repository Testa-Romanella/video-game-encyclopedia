{"id": 652802, "slug": "winter-fox", "name": "Winter Fox", "name_original": "Winter Fox", "description": "<p>Winter Fox is a classic platformer. To save your abducted brother you must brave many challenges that test your reflexes. Squash monsters, collect coins and power-ups, and avoid nefarious traps! The game supports keyboard and controller (PS/XBOX). Controls can be viewed from the main menu and pause screen.\u00a0Full screen recommended, visually.</p>\n<p>All artwork and characters are created by my son Tue (6) and this is our first game, made from scratch to learn Unity.</p>\n<p>TIPS:</p>\n<p>Jump on top of monsters to defeat them. Use snowballs to freeze them temporarily. Collect coins to gain extra lives. Use ice bridges to extend your jumps. Shields protect once against monsters, traps or flames. Should the game studder try exiting full screen, closing other tabs or restart browser.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T03:56:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/813/813acb5e7a6c4473cd4d471dfd3d3e2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Witching Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
