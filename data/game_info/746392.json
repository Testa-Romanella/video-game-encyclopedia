{"id": 746392, "slug": "dude-wheres-my-pills", "name": "Dude, Where's My Pills?", "name_original": "Dude, Where's My Pills?", "description": "<p>This game was created during the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1 in a week by me, pazzzeey and Alex375. The theme was \"It is not real\".</p>\n<p>In this platformer you play as a person who is slowly going insane without taking his pills. He wakes up in the middle of the night and has to navigate through his house to find his bottle of pills. But, as he is going insane, he starts imagining things that aren't there (they are \"not real\", so to say) and the short walk downstairs becomes a terrific gauntlet of haunted teddy bears and other traps.</p>\n<p>Have fun with the linear gameplay of this 50 screen long adventure while taking 4 different unprescripted pills with various side effects!</p>\n<p>Warning:\u00a0This game contains flashing lights and colors and might not be suited for all audiences, though there is a setting to disable the effects. Play at your own risk!</p>\n<p>Fun fact: All the sound effects in this game are made with my mouth. You could say it's canon that I\u00a0am the voice the player character hears when he goes insane.</p>\n<p>If you want to, you can check out my other games on this website and join my gamedev discord server!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T06:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78b/78b151e63a51ea339638f979fb910907.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jenus358", "Alex375", "pazzzeey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
