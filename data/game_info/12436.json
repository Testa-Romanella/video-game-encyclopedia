Giant TVs on the streets play films that show the \u2018world of tomorrow\u2019... A future, which could be so great, but is just science fiction! You turn away in disbelief. Suddenly, you receive a message on your mobile phone: \u201cYou have been selected by the Dark Star Foundation for Science and Technology to take part in the one thousand years voyage\u2026\u201c What on earth..?!? Really?! Just a few moments later you are walking up to the magnificent Dark Star building. What exactly do they mean by a one thousand years voyage?<br/>    As one of many unremarkable people in the world, YOU were luckily (or unfortunately?) chosen by the Dark Star Project getting frozen for thousand years to become witness of the future. You do not know, mankind is wiped out by a deadly virus during your long, cold sleep. As you wake up, you realize the world has changed to an endless seeming desert.Gameplay<br/>Thousands of Years Later is sandbox game with a Mechanical Manufacturing System and a Construction System. You can use basic elements to produce various weapons, gears, vehicles or anything you might find useful to protect your constructions. It\u2019s even possible for you, to build a huge castle in the game. Since you live in the wastelands, you\u2019ll have to find water, to not suffer from the high temperatures during daytime. Even if you are lucky enough not being swept away by a sandstorm, you ought to return to your shelter before night, when the ugly mutants enter the stage. If you ever encounter these dangerous monsters, you will die for sure. So make sure you set up a suitable line of defense in the daytime to avoid being crushed at night.<br/><br/><strong>Collection</strong><br/> <br/>For manufacturing, you should collect stone ore, iron ore, rare metal ore and radioactive ore. To survive, you should find water sources .<br/><br/><strong>Construction System</strong><br/><br/>You can produce different basic construction elements by the ores you collected, such as: bricks, pillars, platforms, stages and many more. Different construction elements have different durabilities, as they can be wracked and carried away. You need to build a base to speed up constructions.<br/><br/><strong>Mechanical System</strong><br/><br/>The mechanical system is divided into two parts: design and production. You can design all mechanical devices in your basement control system. When ready with your design, you have to transform the mechanics into integration modules to work for you. The process will consume ores according to your design. You can put mechanics everywhere you need them with integration modules.<br/><br/><strong>Power System</strong><br/><br/>None mechanics can work without power supply. Thus you have to design the Establish the Power Generation Equipment first. Then you can set up the power grid, connecting it to the available devices. You should pay special attention to the distribution of the power and the safety of your power grid, because an overload and other failures will cause a lot of trouble!Features<br/>A huge open world with a creative production system<br/>The whole experience of real survival", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efa/efae83b37d24bd959f50e2a6c52c82fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piao Jingfu"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piao Jingfu"], "esrb_rating": null}
