The evil Robits are here, and they've taken over with their evil ways, or something like that! It's time for us Lobits to get them out of here.</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as a Lobit, a little cube that can temporarily change its size from its original. However, if they stay in a size unlike their own for too long, they will die. Use this mechanic to get around the puzzles, and defeat the Grand Robit!</p>\n<p>This is my first game made with Godot, and also my first game jam! I had a lot of fun (and anxiety) with this. If anybody has any feedback they'd be willing to share, that'd be greatly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T09:09:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b30496f52fb77e1a377abce452c6713c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Curruff"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
