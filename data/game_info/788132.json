Black goes first, and if a piece can capture, a capture move must be made. Player colours are\u00a0randomised at the start of a game, and your colour appears at the bottom (as if you were sitting at the table playing).</p>\n<p>If a piece reaches the opposite end of the board, it is crowned and can move in any diagonal direction.</p>\n<p>Use your mouse to select a highlighted piece, then select a square to move the piece. Use right click to cancel selection and choose another piece.</p>\n<p>Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T12:59:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e74/e74cbd13d3c1ac6f83ad097f0f7d59d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NickKaon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
