He can use two mirror like gadgets which helps him to get reflected on to the other side horizontally or vertically. As he cannot jump at all, he must rely on his super gadgets!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left/Right Arrow - Movement\u00a0</p>\n<p>Down Arrow - Toggle Upside down(You cannot get reflected vertically unless the character stands upside down)</p>\n<p>Space- Get reflected to the other side</p>\n<p>Z- Toggle using\u00a0Horizontal Mirror</p>\n<p>X- Toggle using Vertical Mirror</p>\n<p>R- Restart</p>\n<p>Can you finish all the stages?</p>\n\n<p>This game is still in its initial stage, so I'd appreciate if you give me a review on it.
