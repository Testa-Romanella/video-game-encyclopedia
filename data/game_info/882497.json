It's my first godot game. I made all game resources by myself. Hope you like it. :)</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>You are the ghost on a cemetery, and you help the zombies to find peace by releasing them. To do so you stay close to them for a short while. However, this costs you energy. This energy can be reloaded in the center area close to the torch. Try to get as many points, by releasing zombies, as you can within 90 seconds. You only need the cursor keys to move the ghost.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T18:07:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c4c024fa8b8ee3025cc346d32940a4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["anipatok"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
