{"id": 806672, "slug": "alchemist-apprentice", "name": "Alchemist Apprentice", "name_original": "Alchemist Apprentice", "description": "<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is a 2.5D game where you play as an apprentice alchemist who has to take care of the town's potion shop for at least 500 seconds (~8 minutes). You will have to cut, crush &amp; mix various ingredients to craft potions.\u00a0For that, you will have to learn alchemy by reading the recipe book you have been given. But you have to be quick because customers are already waiting for their beverage!</p>\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong></p>\n<p>WGJ257's theme was <strong>Books</strong>. Our take on this was to create a game about learning &amp; memorizing knowledge quickly (since time would be crucial to satifsy customers) from a book.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>W, S, A, D/Z, S, Q, D: <strong>movement</strong></li><li>E: grab/ungrab items, place items on <strong>machines </strong>&amp; take items from item boxes</li><li>F (hold): interact with the <strong>machines\u00a0</strong>(<strong>cauldron</strong>, <strong>mortar &amp; pestle</strong>, <strong>cutting table</strong>)</li><li>Space: open/close\u00a0the\u00a0<strong>recipe book</strong><br/>\n</li><li>Escape: open/close the <strong>escape menu</strong> (pause, restart &amp; exit)</li></ul>\n<p>The ingredients must be placed in the cauldron in the same order as they appear in the recipe book. The recipes queues change at each game start (so every new game is a challenge).\u00a0After all of them are in, you can toggle the cauldron by pressing 'F'\u00a0on it to create the potion</p>\n<p><strong>Post-Mortem:</strong></p>\n<p>I wish I put more time in making the actual game\u00a0than doing other useless things like playing, so I had to rush the last day (and still not finishing it :p) and the day after the jam to make an update where you can actually play the game (yay)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Team</p>\n<ul><li>Guthen (me) : coding &amp; (most of the) visual</li><li>Rin Kaoru : visual</li></ul>\n<p>We worked together for 3 days and then I \"finished\" the game alone for the 4 other days (we joined 1 day after jam's start).</p>\n<p>Apollo\u00a0colors palette.
