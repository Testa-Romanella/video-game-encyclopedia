Its been ages since you saw one of your besties - they've been distance recently and frankly more than a little highly strung. Maybe seeing some friends will do them good.</p>\n<p>You are a brave hero with a secret identity. Your alter ego fights for justice every damn day. You've just barely come out on top in a fight against an intergalactic terror with a thousand mouths, each the size of a galaxy. You used every power in your arsenal to do it. Your super-watch beeps: its your closest friend, wanting to celebrate an important occasion. If you hurry, you can use Jupiter's gravity well to slingshot you back to Earth with just enough time to shower and change into your civilian clothes.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>PLANNED ACTIVITIES</strong>*:</p>\n<p>The socialite player takes the card and writes down an invitation to any kind of social event (ideally, one where the aim is to have a good time, not save the world). <br/>They place their card face-down on the table, which means that the hero side of the card is visible. Slide the hero card across to the hero player.</p>\n<p>The hero player writes down three superpowers that they have recently used to save the world. You don't need to describe them in great detail, but definitely give them evocative names.</p>\n<p>Optionally, you can describe your heroics and the foe you're facing and how your super powers allow you to save the day.</p>\n<p>The socialite player reveals their side of the card to the hero, briefly explaining the fun party they have planned.</p>\n<p>The hero arrives at the party fresh from their super-heroics.</p>\n<p>The socialite is responsible for describing their chosen venue, the party and the socialite's actions. <br/>The hero is responsible for describing the hero and their reactions to everything that goes down at the party.</p>\n<p>The game should reach a natural conclusion after the hero has used all three of their super-powers.</p>\n<p>This is a collaborative activity: the socialite character might not necessarily know that their friend is also secretly a super hero, but both players can set up situations where the hero can use their powers.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This game was designed for the Tiny Library jam.<br/>Game design by Ogrillion.<br/>Thanks to Kilimanjaro STUDIOz on Unsplash<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:15:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8f/b8fb5f69387babe251331c1c2c422f7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ogrillion"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
