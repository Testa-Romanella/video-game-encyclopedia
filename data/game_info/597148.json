The player needs to make their way through six areas, which consist of a number of floors, defeating enemies by using character-specific attacks and collecting keys to be able to advance to the next floor. It received generally positive reception for its gameplay, but was criticized for the lack of puzzle elements and under-utilization of the Virtual Boy&#39;s 3D effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T23:16:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c3/6c33d7c5541b536a76f30eab172d404a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": null}
