As a Theurgist, you can call to Konned, the god of light and warmth, to guide you. What if the rest of Ethshar could as well? With a crafty brain and plenty of reflective surfaces, you begin experimenting with the light he\u2019s gifted you. By exchanging regular sacrifices, the god Konned provides you with light that could be used to light lamps in every city in Ethshar.</p>\n<p>Use mirrors and glass to redirect beams of light in this level-based puzzle game, to help provide a safe and consistent source of light for every city in The\u00a0World!\u00a0Konned's Lightbearer was a game created by Andrew Heater, Anna Conway, Justin Neft, and KeCheng Yu in five weeks, as part of our Game Design and Development course.
