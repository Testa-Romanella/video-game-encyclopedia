Succeed, and you \n      can journey to the next, even deadlier track. Fail, and the gate will \n      slam shut, destroying your ship. Enhance your ship with weapon pickups, \n      coordinate attacks with your friends to fire powerful combined blasts \n      and use your grapple to snag energy and pickups in the midst of combat. \n      Control your ship with the Wii Remote controller, Nunchuk controller or \n      Classic Controller, or use the \"paired\" control system that allows two \n      players to use a connected Wii Remote and Nunchuk or Classic Controller \n      at the same time. Offering 50 levels of intense action, powerful \n      pickups, high-speed bonus levels and mayhem for up to four players, \n      Gyrostarr is a killer arcade challenge.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d2/5d242ebb294f0070f152ebe3e4e82d90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["High Voltage Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
