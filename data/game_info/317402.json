So we have taken on to\u00a0the horror genre games and removed the famous yet overused 'carry-your-own-light-source' mechanic. In <em>No Reflections</em> there's no lamp, camera or torch you could carry around. Just you, a light ray and a bunch of mirrors... and the spooky demon waiting around the corner to reap your soul.\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><em>Joking,\u00a0</em>there's no scary demon - but we have a timer which is equally spooky.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>BOO!</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>________________</p>\n<p>Developed by:</p>\n<p><strong>Ionut Ciobanu</strong> - Designer &amp; Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Alixander Roden</strong> - Programmer</p>\n<p><em>(Level 6 Design Masterclass Group 03)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T05:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bae/bae5c37566c55e683e1e07e04ce267cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IonutCiobanu"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
