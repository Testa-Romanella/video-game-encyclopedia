The musical is a collaging together of four landscapes and songs performed by Filip, composed by Roger Hallaway. Each song is an exploration of a meta narrative about virtual reality, digital materiality, and the fantasy of autonomy. As each quadrant is interacted with, a song and animation begin to unfold, deconstructing the landscape and each other through a reconstruction of the artist as a digital cowboy.</p>\n<p>The installation was exhibited at the ArtCenter College of Design Wind Tunnel December 2016 - February 2017, and at the GHOSTING.TV VR/AR Popup in Berkeley in March 2017. It has since been revamped and built for at-home consumption on the Vive(and maybe Oculus, but I haven't tested with one). </p>\n<p><em><em>Itch is a great platform because it gives me statistics for the project as well as </em>promotes the indie development community. But, if you'd rather not create an itch.io account - I understand and have uploaded the project to a google drive.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Filip Kostic 2016</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/673/6739c5b162f6dd6a1ec9e9f28338ff54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FilipKostic"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
