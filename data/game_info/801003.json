This was done in 3 hours so expect this game to not be so bueno. It was also done all by myself, and a single used asset.<br/><br/>I would like to let the people who play this ahead of time that there will be a point where the game will break, and the budget and the required amount of items will not match with what is on the screen. Unfortunately the best way to fix it is just restart the game entirely by refreshing your browser.</p>\n<p>Used Asset:<br/>BG Music - Action RPG Free Music</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/27795<br/></p>\n<p>If you want to see the process (speedrun) of this game, check out my stream video.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T18:01:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82b/82b3f4375c9142b1dfabb83c9fafebc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Edge"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
