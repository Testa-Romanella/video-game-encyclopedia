The flashing is a visual element which greatly lends to the increasing loss of control, and it is a shame not all players get to experience that.</li><li>It is possible to accidentally \u201cskip\u201d the game\u2019s ending scene. It requires a decision be made by use of the same buttons the player has been pressing all game, and because the scenes switch so rapidly from final play moment to decision screen, a player switching key presses at that time may unintentionally make a selection without even having time to read the text on the final screen.</li></ul>\n<p>Because of these two thematically important issues, a video of an \u201cideal\u201d playthrough has been uploaded to youtube: </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T05:16:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d62/d626cfee4733687a2453f61c38218004.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pete Vellucci Jr", "Sarah Landstrom"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
