Really bored. Inspired by all the festivities and the culture around me I\u00a0developed Santa's Rooftop. It showcases this wonderful time of the year........ with its own twist.\u00a0<br/><br/>Because I hate sleep and internal peace, I\u00a0decided to just give myself a week to complete this project. So yes, there may be stupidly designed levels. broken mechanics; and a chaotic vibe; but that all just adds to the experience.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>A and D to move left and right<br/>W or Space to jump<br/>S to slide<br/><br/><br/><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>Gameplay - Ishaan Bahl / Illusion<br/>SFX - Ishaan Bahl / Illusion<br/>Art -\u00a0Ishaan Bahl / Illusion<br/>Background music - N/A (I\u00a0found it on some website artist was not listed)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/295/295687d06360e6bf407ab25e42b6bf24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Illusion"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
