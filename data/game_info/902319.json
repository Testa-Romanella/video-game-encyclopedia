So far after quite a bit of time working, due to a personal life aswell and having to learn and study it all I've finally come to a partially satisfying conclussion that I can start showing off the game. There are still\u00a0A LOT to go within this game, such as a Playermode, custom hud icons, custom item models, a better UI for health, animations and such but this is a beginning!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What is this game?;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The official name of the game is Graveyard: The Shift, The game is a short horror game,\u00a0you're a young man who has just gotten work at a Graveyard, doing the literal graveyard shift, however what you haven't been told is how the dead comes to live after a certain amount of time of walking around the graveyard, your objective is to find the bible which you can use to curse the demons/creatures away for a certain amount of time, before they come back. Initially the point of the game is for you to stay alive for 10 minutes, or you will lose.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Current\u00a0</strong><strong>Features;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>- Chat commands(Will be listed below, together with keybinds and controls)\r\n<br/>\r\n- Inventory\u00a0System\r\n<br/>\r\n-\u00a0Day and Night time System\r\n<br/>\r\n- Flashlight System\r\n<br/>\r\n- Bible to exorcise creature(s)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Upcoming Features;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>- 5 Days of work to complete the game fully<br/>\r\n- A richer storyline with background Story\r\n<br/>\r\n- Randomized item locations<br/>\r\n- Bigger map with more buildings and open area<br/>\r\n- Optimized Gameplay<br/>\r\n- Fixed Animations<br/>\r\n- Proper playermodel rather than the current TicTac I have right now\r\n<br/>\r\n- Better and more voice acting\r\n<br/>- Friendbased Coop(Maybe?)<br/>\n</p><p>- Settings for Mouse sensitivity;</p>\n<p>- Visual Settings</p>\n<p>- Keybind Settings</p>\n<p>- Fix enemy movement problems</p>\n<p>- Richer story line</p>\n<p>- More voice acting with more and better voice actors(Next update probably!)</p>\n<p>- Create a more welcoming UI</p>\n<p>- Create a more welcoming Menu and Pause Menu</p>\n<p>- Fix Double Jumps</p>\n<p>- More variety of buildings and open area to walk around in!</p>\n<p>- More tools to do needy stuff!</p>\n<p>- And much more!</p>\n<p><strong>Keybinds and Chat commands;</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Current Keybinds;</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p><em>WASD</em>\u00a0- Basic movement back forth, side to side.\r\n<br/><em>Spacebar -\u00a0</em>Making your character jump\r\n<br/><em><br/>E -\u00a0</em>Pick up the Flashlight(Only object beside that bible for rn which is picked up by a button as shown in video)<br/>\n<em><br/>F -\u00a0</em>Toggle on and off flashlight when it's in your hand\r\n<br/><em>Escape -\u00a0</em>Open the temporary little pause menu created, that will also pause the game\r\n<br/><em><br/>T -\u00a0</em>Open the chatbox, remember to click on it first though for it to work properly\r\n<br/><em><br/>Number 1</em>\u00a0-\u00a0If archieved will take out Flashlight or put it away\r\n<br/><em><br/>Number 2</em>\u00a0-\u00a0If archieved will take out Bible or put it awa</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Information;</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>First take video</em>:\u00a0First Take\r\n<br/>\n<em>Discord:\u00a0Discord Server</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T09:50:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/acc9b35bfd9e634142055e6cc09091bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jackyfied"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
