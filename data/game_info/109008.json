{"id": 109008, "slug": "antia", "name": "Antia", "name_original": "Antia", "description": "<p>Join the lone mercenary Wolf as he travels to the distant land of Pilano. However upon arriving it is clear this land is far from peaceful. The great wall has been breached and monsters are pouring out into the country side. It is your job to uncover the secrets of this land and end the conflict. </p><p>Antia plays as a turn based Action RPG but its greatest strength is in its compact world. You could hear a rumor in a pub which leads you to an unexpected side quest and an hour later realize you are yet to progress the story. This is a game to experience organically and even has a hidden secret which I will be surprised if you find. Please don't judge a book by its cover and give this game a shot. I put a lot of work into it and I really hope you enjoy it.</p><p>Feel free to leave comments good or bad and I will gladly update the game to fix any problems or change anything that needs changing. Also if people like it I can later make new side quests and new content and make it a free update for everyone.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you buy the game. In the future I hope to get this game on the Playstore but no promises. Thanks again and I hope you have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/556/5563b171e6cbbc874ec7c2ec2159001d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["RoboBoy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
