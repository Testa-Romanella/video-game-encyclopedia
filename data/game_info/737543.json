Every object in the game has a light or dark element; light ignores light, dark ignores dark. You must carefully manage your own polarity to avoid incoming damage while shifting to the opposite element to destroy your targets.\r\n</p>\n<p>Duality Dimension was made by a team of four with a unique restriction. We came up with a core mechanic for the game, and each team member created a boss fight built around that mechanic.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T09:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d43f79fe8cb0174f98be5c049cc7f3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BmeisterCD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
