Attacks are split into two parts, an <strong>Element </strong> and an\u00a0<strong>Action</strong>. By joining them together, you can combine them to perform that attack.</p>\n<p>Use the handy '<strong>REJOIN BUTTON\u2122' </strong> to shift your current hero around the party. Their position will effect which <strong>Element</strong> or\u00a0<strong>Action</strong>, they group up with.</p>\n<p>When joined with another\u00a0<strong>Party Member</strong>, your current hero will form a G<strong>roup</strong>. <strong>Groups </strong>attack together, and each hero has access to every attack provided by the group.\u00a0<strong>However,\u00a0</strong>if an\u00a0<strong>Enemy</strong> attacks they'll do damage to the whole\u00a0<strong>Group</strong>.</p>\n<p>Each\u00a0<strong>Hero</strong>\u00a0and <strong>Enemy\u00a0</strong>has an assigned\u00a0<strong>Element</strong> which will affect how they do battle. Using an Element that they are weak against will boost the damage you deal.</p>\n<p>Both\u00a0Elements and\u00a0<strong>Actions\u00a0</strong>can stack. Meaning if you join two of the same type. The resulting action will become twice as powerful! Joining two items of different types will have a negative effect. An\u00a0<strong>Element </strong>will become<strong> 'Normal</strong>', and an\u00a0<strong>Action</strong> will become a '<strong>Flail</strong>'.</p>\n<p>There are many different\u00a0<strong>Actions\u00a0</strong>available:</p>\n<p><strong>Attack -</strong> Will attack a <strong>Group </strong>of your choice, and deal damage based on an<strong> Element\u00a0</strong>type\u00a0advantages as well as many Attacks you have stacked.</p><p><strong>Flail-</strong>\u00a0Will attack a\u00a0<strong>Group\u00a0</strong>of your choice, and deal damage one point of damage.
