I do not believe church is a bad thing but I am not sure I understood it well enough to appreciate it. I think I would appreciate church a bit more now than when I was a kid. I have a better idea of what church is about and why people go now then when I was a kid, hopefully this helps you to understand how I felt as a child who had never been to church. </p><p>please note that this was my first time going to church.<br/></p><p>It was the intention to have this experience end after an hour much like church did but I have not included this </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/417/417c9fa7bb6b1263f42478d28dcb56e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Toby Welsh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
