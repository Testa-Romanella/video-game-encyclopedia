It was imagined and brought to life by Alessandro Ghignola, who is mostly known for developing the space simulator game Noctis. You can fly to small spaces called pixels, with several other features, such as walking around them and creating pixels and objects.<br/></p>\n<p>Cryxtels was initially an MS-DOS game (original webpage with downloads here). Later on, a port was developed in order to be playable in modern systems such as Linux. This is that version, maintained on GitHub.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is known to have a bit of an obscure gameplay, so it is recommended that you read the manuals first.</p>\n<ul><li><em>crystal pixels.txt</em>\u00a0is the original instruction text written by Alex himself.
