However, we had fun making it and we hope you'll have fun playing it.</p>\n<p>The download folder is a mess too, just run BOBS FEET.exe and it'll all be good.</p>\n<p>Also, the game crashes, when you exit. But that doesn't really matter, does it?</p><p><strong>This game got 29th place out of 32 in Paint Jam<br/></strong></p><p>We are very proud! We want to thank all of you for your generous support! We didn't believe we would be able to get anything but rock bottom! We are more than satisfied!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd2d1d44fc4087533c676c42668981e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxwellSalmon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
