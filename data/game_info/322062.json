Essentially,\u00a0<em>Rogess</em>\u00a0answers a fairly simple \"what if?\" around the mechanics of chess and the spatial environment of\u00a0<em>Rogue</em>. As with\u00a0<em>Chogue</em>, this reconfiguration of both games leads to something new and odd and maybe, just maybe, kind of enjoyable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T08:02:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee9/ee97120ff372c976314f386c5f173ad0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pippinbarr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
