There are two comet generators, one above and one below. They are set to go off at different intervals so you can see comets flying from all over. To be able to see the planets better, I scaled the sun down by about 1000%, so you can see that Jupiter is almost the size of the sun.</p>\n<ul><li>Added planets<ul><li>Mercury</li><li>Venus</li><li>Mars</li><li>Jupiter</li><li>Saturn</li><li>Uranus</li><li>Neptune</li><li>Pluto (Honorary Planet)</li></ul></li><li>Added second comet generator</li><li>Moved the location of both comet generators</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created By: Alex [Haley] Banker</p>\n<p>Tutorial Videos By: Brian Winn</p>\n<p>Files Provider (Assets): CAS 117 at MSU</p>\n<p>Game Engine: Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T14:50:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/975/975eff433bb0989d3071d016f776340b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["bankerha"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
