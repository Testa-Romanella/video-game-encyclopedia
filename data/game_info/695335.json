However, you are set upon by crystal pirates with their sole goal of stealing the crystals. Use your weapons to combat the pirates! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe left mouse button operates your main weapon. A fast, low-power weapon which can be used to break crystals. The right mouse button utilises the EMP weapon. This is a much stronger, slower weapon which runs on the energy of blue power-crystals. Additionally, it has the ability to weaken the crystal pirates shield. You can also tether yourself to other nearby asteroids by looking at one and holding 'Tab' while floating in space.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T04:52:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7c/a7cc67d2161b10913fd9baaaf6db7edb.jpg", "website": "https://brockbillings595631080.wordpress.com/orbital-mechanics/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xero", "Brock Billings"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Brock Billings"], "esrb_rating": null}
