Each level holds many paths to choose and\u00a0 secrets to uncover.</p>\n<p>The challenges of each level will only grow greater, so finding upgrades throughout the world would be wise. However, very few items are actually vital for completing this linear game. Try to find new equipment each time you play.</p>\n<p>Venture into the underground realm of Imorah - an expansive\u00a0 hell built by the gods to test the strength of mortal challengers. Reaching the end of this fantastical nightmare will reward the mightiest of heroes with immortality.</p>\n<p>Currently the tutorial and first level are complete of a planned ten. Feedback throughout development would be graciously appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Consider joining the Official Discord Server:\u00a0RQErTEh</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Me\u00a0 - Everything Except...</p>\n<p>Inspector J Sound Effects - Sound Effects</p>\n<p>Sidearm Studios - Sound Effects</p>\n<p>Built in Unity 5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T04:22:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d8/9d8344b73a02f3e42e608d72946add46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Floorium"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
