This is a voxel-based 3D Unity Sonic fan game where you play as Sonic and get as far as you can through Green Hill, Marble, and Spring Yard Zone to reach the Master Emerald! (and maybe meet a certain fr<strong>u</strong>g along the way) There are enemies you need to dodge (easily avoidable, just don't make contact with them. It won't end well.) and jump from place to place to make progress. This is still in development, however I'm almost done finishing it! I still need to add the ability to collect rings + add more rings towards the end of the level, a title screen, etc. This is also pretty short, only 3 zones and they are all in one level. I decided to do this since I have no idea what I would do for Labyrinth and Scrap\u00a0Brain Zone. But who knows, maybe I'll make a sequel\u00a0\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. This is also my first Unity game, so don't expect a masterpiece like Sonic Robo Blast 2 or Sonic Utopia. That's pretty much all I have to say, so have fun!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move</p>\n<p>Use to spacebar to jump</p>\n<p>Press L to restart the level (collisions are wonky so you might get stuck in things so I added that feature)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T07:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f7/0f74019bc5b16b24ebb2b00b0763a6b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ItzGreenForever"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
