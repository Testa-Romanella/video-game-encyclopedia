{"id": 649818, "slug": "the-gallery-hit", "name": "The Gallery Hit", "name_original": "The Gallery Hit", "description": "<p><strong>The GALLERY HIT</strong></p>\n<p>Made for Low Rez Jam 2021.<br/><em>The limitation for the jam was a 64x64 resolution and the optional theme used was Police.</em></p>\n<p>You have successfully entered an art gallery with lots of cool art and loot ready for the taking! With your fists at the ready, use your skills as a thief and brawler to sneak around the gallery, avoid guards, break stuff, hit a lot and retrieve what you want to get your ideal score/time, have fun and leave before you get caught!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>This is very short and open-ended. The goal is to take as much of the paintings and gold bars as you can. They're behind glass, so you'll have to break that with your fists or a taser (that works, why not?). You can leave at any time, with any score. The exit is located behind where you spawn, through a door. If you can't read the text there, it states that this is the exit, your score, and that you can exit by pressing the pick up button (F by default).<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\r\n    </p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys - Movement\r\n<br/>Mouse - Looking\r\n</p>\n<p>Esc - Pause\r\n</p>\n<p>Shift - Toggle between Walk / Sprint<br/>\r\nSpace - Jumping<br/>\r\nC - Toggle Crouching\r\n                  </p>\n<p>Q - Peek to the Left <br/>\r\nE - Peek to the Right<br/>\r\nV - Zoom In\r\n        </p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Action for Left Hand<br/>\r\nRight Mouse - Action for Right Hand\r\n      </p>\n<p>H - Holster (bring up / put down hands)\r\n    </p>\n<p>1 - toggle left hand equippable<br/>2 - toggle right hand equippable\r\n      </p>\n<p>F - Pick Up for Art / Loot<br/>\r\nF and Left Mouse or 1 - Pick Up for Left Hand<br/>\r\nF and Right Mouse or 2 - Pick Up for Right Hand\r\n        </p>\n<p>G and Left Mouse or 1 - Drop for Left Hand<br/>\r\nG and Left Mouse or 2 - Drop for Right Hand\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This is very unfinished and unfocused so I apologise for any bugs or lack of clarity in the gameplay. I hope this description will fill you in! It's hard to communicate what you're supposed to do or see when working with such a small resolution, so it was interesting to try. \u00a0There was more planned, maybe later I'll resume development and make it better :)<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for your interest and for playing.
