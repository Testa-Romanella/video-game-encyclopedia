The available builds are the version used to validate the project at 42 Paris.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal was to recreate a small game prototype like \"<strong>Shadowmatic</strong>\", a puzzle game made for mobiles in 2015, more info on www.shadowmatic.com.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can download this project's source code at https://github.com/tac4ttack/In-the-Shadows/<br/></p>\r\nQuick synopsis:\r\n<p>You are working for a company whose business is to clone planets. As part of the quality assurance team, you have to \"recover\" missed planet's artefacts that the copy paste team forgot to process (they are the worst).</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<p>The goals of this school project were:</p>\n<ul><li>Recreate the gameplay of Shadowmatic, a puzzle system based on shadow puppets.</li><li>Have different difficulties for the puzzles (single axis rotation, dual axis rotation, rotation and translation, multiple puzzle pieces).</li><li>Player progression save system.</li><li>Level unlocking animation.</li><li>Mouse and keyboard control system.</li><li>Debug feature giving access to all levels.</li></ul>\n<p>I tried to push further so I added the following features:</p>\n<ul><li>3 players save slots.</li><li>Saving system with serialization instead of using \"player prefs\".</li><li>Settings panel for the audio and various other tweaks.</li><li>A tutorial system.</li><li>Polished scenes, engine exploration with its lightning system.</li></ul>\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n<p>For the moment, the build is running at a fixed resolution of 1280x720 pixels, I need to add graphic settings customization.</p>\n<p>Using the PageUp or PageDown keys will increase or decrease the graphic quality settings.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n3D Assets\r\n<p>LowPoly Environment Pack<br/>Low Poly Foliage Pack - 001<br/>Modular Terrain Pack<br/>Low Poly Moon<br/>Low Poly Earth v2<br/>Elenfant<br/>Isometric Japanese Team Room<br/>Shadow Drawer<br/>Low Poly Room<br/>Crocodile<br/>Low Poly Crocodile<br/>Low Poly Clouds</p>\r\nSound Effects:\r\n<p>\"Fallout 2\" by Black Isle studio<br/>\r\nFireworks Explosion Fizz<br/>\r\nSuccess02<br/></p>\r\nMusics:\r\n<p>\"Visage Of The Pale Queen\" by Nycto CC3.0<br/>\r\n\"Rounding\" by Savfk CC3.0<br/>\r\n\"Retro Dreamscape\" by Twin Musicom CC4.0<br/>\r\n\"Intuit\" by Kevin MacLeod CC4.0<br/>\r\n\"Listen To The Rain\" by Mark Tyner CC3.0<br/>\r\n\"Wild\" by KV CC4.0<br/></p>\r\nTools:\r\n<p>Blender<br/>\r\nAdobe Photoshop<br/>\r\nText Mesh Pro<br/>\r\nPost Processing<br/>\r\nPolybrush<br/>\r\n\"Low Poly Water\" and \"Flat shading\" techniques<br/></p>\r\nText Fonts:\r\n<p>Potra<br/>\r\nRezland<br/>\r\nConthrax<br/>\r\nSpaceScape<br/></p>\r\nSpecial thanks:\r\n<p><strong>Cassoul</strong> and the <strong>ELFIOR-NAN-BRASI</strong> posse for bearing me during the creation of this project, <strong>my family</strong> and <strong>Ghanima</strong> the cat, and of course anyone I am not able to remember right now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T03:55:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ac/8acde332e810d8d3a6636a57e1ba7fe0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["tac"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
