Eating a shrimp will protect you from one hit, and you'll get more points for each shrimp you eat without getting hit. Oh, and you can eat Bloop too, if you catch him outside of his bubble.</strong></p>\n<p>This game is over a month late, but it was made to celebrate Gura's birthday. Happy Birthday, Gura!
