They were alone but happy.\u00a0Instead of friends, Dayana had needle and thread.\u00a0She embroidered an imaginary world of animal companions\u2014and named it <strong>Stitchwood</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>King Softhoof</strong> ruled the realm wisely.</p>\n\n<p>His loyal sorceress, <strong>Starwhisker</strong>, watched for danger.</p>\n\n<p>And the mighty raccoon knight, <strong>Lady BerryClaw</strong>, protected them all.</p>\r\nThen one winter night...\r\n<p>In a bone-creaking, midnight frost, Dayana's father went out to get firewood. He never returned from the snow. Dayana waited up, sewing and whispering in worry.\u00a0As dawn broke\u00a0she nodded off\u2014and\u00a0<strong>badly pricked her finger</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her blood dripped and soaked across Stitchwood. Dayana grew fevered and sick. Her\u00a0sleep overflowed with nightmares, and <strong>a great evil tangled forth</strong>.</p>\r\nThe Unraveling\r\n<p>Dayana's sickness\u00a0tattered the realm. <strong>Lady BerryClaw gave her life</strong>\u00a0in a final battle against the awful creatures pouring in from the edgelands. Starwhisker disappeared in a flash of sorceress smoke. The King was captured.</p>\n<p>Finally the next night, as the wind outside her cottage howled even louder,\u00a0Dayana awoke. Appalled at the bloodied mess before her, she\u00a0restitched Lady BerryClaw by the light of her last candle.\u00a0And this time she gave the knight\u00a0a\u00a0<strong>heartshine shield</strong>.</p>\n<p>\"This will protect you from the monsters.\u00a0You must go and find king Softhoof,\" said Dayana through her tears, \"he's alone in the cold. But I know he's still alive .... somewhere.\"</p>\n<p>BerryClaw sensed that the king's fate was somehow tangled\u00a0with Dayana's father. <strong>\"Save the king and I shall save the woodcutter,\"</strong> she growled.</p>\n<p>And so BerryClaw set out\u2060\u2014on the greatest quest her world had ever known.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p><strong>A</strong><strong>rrows</strong> or <strong>wasd</strong> to move. <strong>Spacebar</strong> to sword.<br/><strong>h</strong> to hide screen effects.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was made in 2 weeks for the lowrez game jam 2022, by me, <strong>hugbug</strong>.
