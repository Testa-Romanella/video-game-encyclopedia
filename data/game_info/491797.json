Three months later, the war ended with an armistice agreement proposed by the Southern Cross Alliance led by EAU and SAU. However, the armistice agreement did not solve any problems. On the contrary, it caused earth-shaking changes in the world structure. All alliances gradually began to fall apart. The former allies became enemies. Because of the inequality of the armistice agreement, successive armed conflicts began to erupt in some areas.
