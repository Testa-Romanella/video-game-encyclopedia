Pretend not to be trying to kill your friends. <br/>(inspired by board games such as <em>The Resistance: Avalon</em> and <em>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</em>).</p><p>This game was created by Connor Halford in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 33 game jam compo. Theme: <em>You Are The Monster</em>. As per the rules, full source code download is available at the bottom (though bear in mind I've never made a Unity game before so the code and structure is pretty dire). Thanks to David, Ewan and Cameron for helping me playtest the game even though they were busy with their own.<br/></p><p>Note: Going fullscreen may cut off the important text along the bottom of the screen. If the text is cut off, please don't try and play in fullscreen - the game is much worse if you can't see the order of play and status of players.</p>How To Play<br/><p>Each player controls both a Human and a Monster. At the start of each turn all 4 players decide which direction they want their Human to move. Once all 4 players have submitted their choice the moves play out one at a time, with each player's Monster moving in the opposite direction to their Human. The order the moves play out in is randomized each turn and is displayed at the bottom.</p><p>At the beginning of a round each player is secretly told whether they're playing as their Human or their Monster. The goal of Human players is to get to the Exits, while the goal of Monster players is to kill all the Human players. There could be 1, 2 or 3 Monsters in each round, but the Monsters don't know who else is a Monster (if anyone) and the Humans don't know who else is a Human (if anyone). The only guarantee is that there's at least one of each. How much do you trust your friends?</p><p>A game consists of 3 rounds. At the end of each round each player is given a score as follows: <br/>As a Human:</p><ul><li>+500 points for escaping through an Exit</li><li>+100 points if any Human player escaped </li><li>+200 points for surviving </li><li>+200 points for each Human you kill that was controlled by a Monster player </li><li>-200 points for each Human you kill that was controlled by a Human player </li></ul>As a Monster:<ul><li>+250 points for escaping through an Exit </li><li>+100 points if any Monster player escaped </li><li>+200 points for your Human surviving </li><li>+300 points for each Human you kill that was controlled by a Human player </li><li>-300 points for each Human you kill that was controlled by a Monster player </li></ul>A round ends when all the Human players' Humans are dead or as soon as any player's Human touches an Exit.Tips<ul><li>The game supports up to 4 Xbox 360 controllers. This is the recommended way to play, since it's much easier to hide what direction you submit and means you're not all crowded around one keyboard. </li><li>If any Human touches any Monster, they will die. Yes, that means you can kill your own Human accidentally. </li><li>Your Monster cannot die or escape through Exits. </li><li>You have to submit a move every turn, but Humans won't move through walls or other Humans and Monsters won't move through walls, other Monsters or Exits. </li><li>After your Human dies you still control your Monster. Good for revenge kills or Human hunting (if you're sure who's playing as who). Remember that Monsters move in the opposite direction to your inputs. </li><li>When planning your move you can cancel it by submitting the same move again or change it by submitting any other move. This means you can make a show of submitting one move then secretly change it when no-one's looking. </li><li>As soon as all 4 players have submitted a move, they play out. So if you're last to submit then be certain of your choice; you can't change it. </li><li>Bear in mind the order that moves will play out; it's randomized each turn (order of play is always left to right along the bottom of the screen).</li><li>A round ends as soon as <em>any</em> Human touches an Exit. That includes Humans belonging to Monster players.</li></ul>Changelog24/08/2015 15:00 - Fixed the problems with player and monster kills not correctly rewarding points at the end of a round.<p>26/08/2015 01:00 - Upgraded to Unity 5 to change from Unity Web Player to Unity WebGL (HTML5). Also fixed the wording on the end score screen to say 'Humans' instead of 'Players' in several places.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cb/5cbea32435ecd4f61e87d1ba632db27c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RhythmLynx"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
