The story is also basically completely missing. (Aside from some very basic environmental stuff).</p>\n<p>I heavily recommend playing through the game with a controller and using the downloadable version if you are on Windows. (The web version tends to hitch now and then. It may have some visual glitches too).</p>\n<p>It should take around 20-30 minutes to complete, possibly more if you try to find everything in the game.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move / aim</li><li>[Space] or [Z] to jump</li><li>[Shift] or [A]\u00a0to dash (Once unlocked)<strong> (Shift might not work on web build)</strong></li><li>[S] to throw bomb (Once unlocked)</li><li>[S] to detonate bomb (Once unlocked)</li><li>[D] or [X]\u00a0to shoot (Once unlocked)</li><li>[Control] to diagonal aim <strong>(Might not work on web build)</strong><br/>\n</li><li>[Escape] to pause / view map</li><li>[F] to toggle fullscreen</li><li>[Enter] or [Up] to save at a save machine</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gamepad Controls (Xbox Button Names):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left joystick to move / aim\r\n</li><li>(A) to jump\r\n</li><li>(B) to dash (Once unlocked)\r\n</li><li>(Y) to throw bomb (Once unlocked)\r\n</li><li>(Y) to detonate bomb (Once unlocked)\r\n</li><li>(X)\u00a0to shoot (Once unlocked)\r\n</li><li>(Right trigger) to diagonal aim\r\n</li><li>(Start / Options) to pause / view map</li><li>(Up or Left Bumper) to save at a save machine</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Game: Julian Reid</li><li>Engine: Godot 4.0</li><li>Level Editor: LDtk</li><li>Graphics Tools:\u00a0Aesprite and GIMP</li><li>Audio Tools: Reaper with NI Kontakt instruments</li></ul>\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nKnown Issues / Bugs\r\n<ul><li>The first Boss seems to have broken animation when you face him again after beating him.\u00a0</li><li>Steam vents don't have a graphic.</li><li>Control and Shift keys do not work in the web build.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T16:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df7660676bbc9a722ef720f20b41c727.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Julian"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
