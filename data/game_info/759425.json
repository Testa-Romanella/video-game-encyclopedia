{"id": 759425, "slug": "photoncito", "name": "Photoncito", "name_original": "Photoncito", "description": "<p><strong>Photoncito</strong></p>\n<p>The idea of this game is to prevent the photon (particle) from fading because when it collides with the crystals (like polarizers) one part of the photon is reflected and the other is transmitted, these crystals allow only 50% to pass through (for now). To recover what has been lost, revitalizing agents must be taken. To level up, you have to have the photon at 100% and take one more revitalizer, which will raise the photon to the next color (or level, or energy). The game is won after completing 10 levels.<br/></p><p>This game was created as a homework for the course Quantum Games 2022.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T10:48:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a8/6a85f16c5e7622de6de086d0d09610b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clausia"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
