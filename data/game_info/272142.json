Until you can meet our deadlines, you have not yet demonstrated sufficient time commitment to your duties as a quality control analyst for Butland Associates, Inc.</p>\n<p><strong>Unless you somehow magically wake up with time control powers the next day, there's currently no possible way you will ever be promoted within the foreseeable future. Even if you use those powers to, I don't know, prevent evil robots from destroying the office.</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>Have a nice day!</p>\n<p>Martin Chamberlain III<br/>Office Manager, Butland Associates, Inc.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/894/8940bb4aac42d98c29e76c86829df3c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Tellescope"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
