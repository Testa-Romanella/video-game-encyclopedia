Thus you gathered coal to press yourself some diamonds. The problem is, that you don't have a diamond press. So you climb down into a dark cave to gather materials and eventually building your precious diamond press.</p>\n<p>Gameplay<br/>==================</p>\n<p>Your ultimate goal is to build a diamond press. To build a diamond press, you have to gather resources. But you are a noble dwarf, so you don't mine filthy ore yourself, but let drones do the job.</p>\n<p>With different buildings you supply the power and the infrastructure for the mining drones.</p>\n<p>Technical Details<br/>==================</p>\n<p>The game was made in Unity (https://unity3d.com/).
