When I discovered the extra credits jam, I already had a game jam(egypt mini) planned for the day before it, and an idea too so I prioritized the first one. Now since I'm really bad at prioritizing and planning, I ended up rushing both games. On the final day of the extra credits jam, I finally started on making a game for this jam.\u00a0I was making the game with my first idea but then I got bored of it. It was a simple platformer but it didn't seem very fun for me. So with about 8 hours left, I changed my whole concept! Whoo! Also, this was the BIGGEST jam I've joined yet(main reason I\u00a0joined)\u00a0and my 3rd submitted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>Comment down below if you encounter any bugs, have any suggestions or you just wana say hello.\u00a0 Please be polite or the barfkels will invade your dreams.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:37:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9a/c9ace350241ffc7890d7a4dbe2617c66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["glas"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
