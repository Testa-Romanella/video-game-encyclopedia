From murderous dictators to compulsive lying demagogues who throw regular Twitter tantrums, things have gotten dangerously dumb, leading the people astray. One nation is taking a stand and leading the way to a brighter future.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter years of unimaginable incompetence, the American people are demanding more from their leaders. A merit-based competition has emerged as the new and improved way of determining our nation's leaders. After being vetted for basic merit and contributions to the nation, including having all IRS records made public, the nominees enter into a specially designed course meant to test knowledge and decision-making under pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is no pen and paper test, in an arguably unconventional way, the American people have been heard, and in addition to being tested on their knowledge, nominees will also be tested on their ability to wield a firearm. Regardless of their views on gun laws, the majority agree that they want a President who knows how to handle a gun. After all, if you cannot trust a President with a gun, you shouldn\u2019t trust him or her to lead a nation. While the people still support the Secret Service, they don\u2019t think someone should have to take a bullet for a leader that can protect himself and herself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe United States is currently seeking the best and brightest to lead this great country.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDo you have what it takes to be President of the United States?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T03:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ec/6ec964ad689b3d2f01dd41c7f78a5f8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Amendment_One_Games", "Amendment One Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Amendment One Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
