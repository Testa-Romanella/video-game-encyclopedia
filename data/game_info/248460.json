You can try to run away from here, but \"They\" will not allow it. You hear Their voices, but while the light is shining, there is still hope. But what if the light goes out? The voices become intolerable. Their whisper in your head screams \"Die!\" Only a solid spirit can resist all the horrors of this place, and get out to the light. Your flashlight is your best friend and you must collect batteries to keep lighting your way. Some doors are locked, so find the key cards and open them! Remember, if you are left in the dark, you will be lost, and you will forever remain in darkness.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68a/68aca0341b316aa363bee66b2107d2a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Falco Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Falco Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
