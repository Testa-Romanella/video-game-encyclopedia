Our idea was that the player was to be the treasure and was being hunted by some enemy. we settled on a typical \"Gamer Boy\"\u00a0looking for some spare change ( and resembling\u00a0 a leprechaun for their love of treasure) and the player was to be the spare change.</p>\n<p>The game is set inside the Gamers living room and the goal is to navigate around the room using the furniture as platforms to return to the save haven for all spare change; between the sofa cushions while avoiding the AI controlled human who searches the room for you.</p>\n<p>The player controls a treasure (a coin) by applying force to the coins physics body using A,D and W. This makes the coin roll along the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently only a prototype, certain key features remain unfinished due to time restraints. The game logic for winning and losing was not finished so currently the player can only explore the level which is critical but the physical movement remains amusing. Sound was also unfinished as we planned to add royalty free music.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything made from scratch apart from the character animations which were sourced from mixamo.com</p>\n<p>Art - Eilidh Rose Norris -\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/eilidhnorris</p>\n<p>Game Design - Laura Watson</p>\n<p>Programming - Adam Higgins, Martyn Chapman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T03:51:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d1/6d15311605b6a605908d552567f75b20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdamHiggins"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
