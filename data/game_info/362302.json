Using items or interacting with things do not count as steps the robot takes.<br/>Tasks such as \"USE A [...]\" or \"DROP [...]\" need to be fulfilled right before taking a step to count for that step.<br/>Yellow tasks are 'locked'. This means you can only complete the tasks below them after completing the locked task.</p>\n<p>When failing a level, it will simply restart.
