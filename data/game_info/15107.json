{"id": 15107, "slug": "fuego", "name": "Fuego!", "name_original": "Fuego!", "description": "Fuego! Fuego is an online Mexican standoff game between two opposing players and their teams of gun toting animal-banditos. The game starts in the standoff where players position and orient their banditos one at a time, in double blind turns. During the standoff players are trying to unravel the impending shootout while identifying strategic linchpins and outsmarting their opponent.<br/><br/>After all the banditos have been placed, the shootout ensues and the players watch the consequences of their actions. You shoot a bank, you get the gold. You shoot a bandito, you steal the gold. Just make sure that when the dust settles, your gang walks away with the bigger haul. Even if that means losing a few friends along the way.Game Modes<strong>Online Multiplayer</strong><br/><ul><li>Play against random opponents or arrange matches with friends<br/></li><li>Collect new animal banditos and accumulate gold</li></ul><strong>Single Player / Offline </strong><br/><ul><li><strong>Single Player Puzzle Mode</strong> - Solve 60 Mexican standoff puzzles<br/></li><li><strong>AI</strong> - Practice your skills against an AI opponent</li></ul>Press / Awards<ul><li>\"Indie Game Showcase\" - Boston Festival of Indie Games, 9 September, 2015 <br/></li><li>\"Indie Prize Showcase\" - Casual Connect, 11 August, 2015 <br/></li><li>\"PAXEast2015 Indie MEGABOOTH Showcase\" - Indiecade, 6 March, 2015 <br/></li><li>\"Best of IXC Game Tasting\" - Indiecade, 9 October, 2014 <br/></li><li>\"Quick and elegant fun.\" - Alice O'Connor, Rock Paper Shotgun <br/></li><li>\"Just a super addicting game.
