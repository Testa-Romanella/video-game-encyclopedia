In a year, we've worked with artists to put out music, games, and tons of great visual art. In celebration of all the artists we've worked with this year, we collected all of 2019's GQ Art Club entries into one free booklet, with links to all of the artists' other work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other than $15 for our SoundCloud subscription, GQ keeps none of the money it makes from Patreon; every last cent goes to our artists. If you'd like to support the work we do, and the  artists we contract, please consider becoming a Patron:</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/gamequery</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T04:59:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75dc95cf95d175b1b9ab04ed036df414.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Query"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
