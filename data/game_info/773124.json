I wanted to share it with you because I thought have created a space where you can invite your friends or meet other people in a multiplayer way.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In addition to all these, an area has been created where the whitelist participants can preview and buy while publishing NFT. Since NFT is an art gallery, I chose the most used platform, namely OpenSea. Apart from that, if you want to get paid in the gallery, I used Binance QR, which also provides a reliable payment method, so that the person can only scan and receive it by phone. For everything in the gallery to change easily, you only need to enter your username.</strong></p>\n<p>\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605\r\n</p>\r\nExample Gameplay and Trailer\r\n<br/>\n<p>\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605\r\n</p>\r\nControl Scheme\r\nW-A-S-D ==&gt; Movement\r\nE ==&gt; Interaction\r\nESC ==&gt; Options\r\n<p>\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606\r\n</p>\r\nContact\r\n<p>Visit the website\r\n</p>\n<p>Source Code\r\n</p>\n<p>artistscompany@protonmail.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Do not hesitate to give your suggestions and comments.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606:;;:\u2605:;;:\u2606\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T11:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31e/31eb26231c99902854228756891a8dd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["artistscompany"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
