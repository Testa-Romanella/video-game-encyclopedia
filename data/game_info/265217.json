During any spare moment, you can blast a breakaway power run to the end zone. Just be careful not to spike your iPhone or iPad into the ground with your touchdown dance.<br/><br/>Juke combines the excitement of American football with classic arcade game action. Dodge the opposing team's players to score a touchdown. Keep running! Collect money and health to prolong your run. Try a spin-juke move to get out of trouble.<br/><br/>Grab a briefcase for a burst of power running and temporary invincibility. Smash some cars while you are at it. And watch out for referees... you have been warned!<br/><br/>This is the free version of Juke. One player / runner is provided for free. There is opportunity to unlock additional characters in-game for free, or in-app purchase for all available characters and removal of ads.<br/><br/>Maelstrom Interactive is a small, family company from Kirkland, Washington.
