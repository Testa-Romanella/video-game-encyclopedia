Levels and a final sequence, the levels will increase slowly in difficulty. <br/>You have 3 helicopters and start with your helicopter at your BASE platform in the left upper corner and have to go to a destination platform in the lower right corner on a landing platform where LAND is signed on it. <br/>You have to watch your fuel to fly the helicopter if your fuel is empty the helicopter is going down slowly and will be destroyed if you are not fast enough to refill your helicopter.<br/><br/>TASK: <br/><br/>Your task ist to free and rescue different platformer things like men, cats, birds, snowman or treasure chest and watch out and avoid moving platforms.<br/>There are several things to collect and other things to shoot at, every thing you collect or shoot will increase your score, perhaps leading to a new highscore.<br/><br/>BONUS: <br/><br/>Each level finished you will receive a score bonus for all the things you have collected. <br/><br/>IMPORTANT: CHECKPOINTS:<br/><br/>To finish a level and go to the next level you have to visit all the 3 checkpoints with the helicopter. <br/>Any checkpoint visited will be added to the upper side on the screen with a symbol of the checkpoint and the checkpoint number 1,2 or 3. <br/>If you dont have passed the 3 checkpoints yet, you are not able to land at the landing platform LAND and not able to go further to the next level up! <br/>There will be a short info message, if checkpoints are still missing why you try to land and then you will have to fly on to visit the missing checkpoint stations. <br/><br/>ENVIRONMENT: <br/><br/>There are red brick walls which need multiple shoots at to destroy them completely. <br/>There are fuel stations where you have to refill your fuel tank. if your fuel is empty then the helicopter will go down. if there is a fuel station nearby then you can perhaps refuel the helicopter in the last seconds., otherwise you will probably crash your helicopter and lose one helicopter life. <br/><br/><br/>KEYBOARD/GAMEPAD: <br/><br/>You can play the game with the keyboard or gamepad<br/><br/>HIGHSCORE: <br/><br/>Perhaps leading you to enter your initials with a new highscore. <br/><br/>Lets have a look and fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c61756607bb841dab896987ba01b12e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RF"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["RF"], "esrb_rating": null}
