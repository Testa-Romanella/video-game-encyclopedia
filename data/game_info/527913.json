{"id": 527913, "slug": "quick-primes", "name": "Quick Primes", "name_original": "Quick Primes", "description": "<p><strong>Quick Maths:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a tiny game about quick prime factorization for everyone who likes to keep their brain active every now and then by doing some quick maths.</p>\n<p>It is about a number that is falling down from the top towards the bottom passing by dedicated calculation gates. When passing a gate the falling number is divided by its digit. You have to adjust the numbers on the gates such, that the falling number is reduced to 1 as soon as it reaches the bottom. Since the digits on the gates are only primes (2, 3, 5 and 7) you must figure out the prime factorization of the number as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More Spice:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The speed of the falling number can be adjusted to fit your needs. Also, if desired, the player can add difficulty to the game by enabling addition gates that add or subtract their digit changing the primes of the number and thus vastly expanding the game's possibility space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you like it?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is the first game I ever published as a hobbyist, so I will by no means ask for any payment. Though, if you want to express your appreciation I am grateful for any support be it by donation, constructive feedback or showing it around. In the end, I want you to enjoy this little game, and if you do so, that is all the reward I need.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>You can play using the mouse by clicking the gates to select them and the arrows to change the values.<br/>Alternatively you can use WASD or the arrow keys:</p>\n<p>W/up, S/down: Select gate<br/>A/left, D/right: Change value on selected gate<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T04:41:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87d/87d8eb94a036c9595db1bff0fd2939ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lorgarmor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
