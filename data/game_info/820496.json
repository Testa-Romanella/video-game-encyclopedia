I'm a one-man team so this is the most efficient way to get a game done. Most assets were taken from the template, except the power icons made by my friend Raven.</p><p>I thought a platformer with some randomness would be fun and exciting, but I just didn't have the time to design the level. I hope you can still catch the idea of planning the move sets in\u00a0realtime because of the randomness.</p><p>This is also the first time I successfully get a game done in this jam. Last year my game was unplayable due to bugs and I still have\u00a0not fix them lol.\u00a0</p><p>Enough of\u00a0mumbling, anyway thanks for playing my game. Feel free to leave rating or comment. I'll be grateful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T01:33:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/cecaa9c820c1271a29bd01b0f6a3dc1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["paulpork"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
