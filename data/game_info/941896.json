I recently started to work on it myself with help from a smart guy named Kevin, who has taught me how to code in the first place. The game has been 1 month in development. It might take a year to finish because this is the first time Kevin and I have used Godot before, which is why it might take a long time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T11:46:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75f/75f47f25b52adc84e17aa6cdcad1bf19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Artingaming"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
