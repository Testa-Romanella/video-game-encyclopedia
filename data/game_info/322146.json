{"id": 322146, "slug": "uncontrollable-panel", "name": "Uncontrollable Panel", "name_original": "Uncontrollable Panel", "description": "<p>Game-a-Week is an intensive project module in which students will create about ten prototype games over the semester, (almost) one per week. The aim of this class is to get students comfortable with the practice of rapid prototyping: working quickly to create a small playable game that effectively proves or disproves a design concept. Drawing influence from game jams, the class will prompt students with weekly thematic, aesthetic, or mechanical constraints (e.g. \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cnature\" or \u201cone-button input\u201d). The hope is that students will practice design, incorporating those lessons into their practice when developing longer-form games in the future.</p>\r\nGame Description\r\n<p><strong>Uncontrollable Panel is a routine game.</strong></p>\n<p>Turn all the leds on to win.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Mouse</strong></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Leith Ben Abdessalem\u00a0https://www.leithba.com/</p>\r\nSupervision\r\n<p>This game was during the Game A Week workshop, organized and supervised by:\u00a0Prof. Csongor Baranyai\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T08:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/179/17904847b63bf325f97bab9df7c51c92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeithBA"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
