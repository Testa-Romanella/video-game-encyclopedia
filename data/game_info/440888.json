Intended to be a 24hr game jam, this 64 hour passion project quickly grew bigger than I was prepared for.</p>\n<p>This visual fan-fiction follows a trial behind the back of Bill Overbeck and other survivors. Will he survive?? YOU decide!<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Includes 5 different endings, and runs about 20 minutes long.\u00a0Story features\u00a0Bill Overbeck, Jeff Johansen, Claudette Morel, Quentin Smith and Freddy Krueger from Dead by Daylights Roster.</p>\n<p> I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!
