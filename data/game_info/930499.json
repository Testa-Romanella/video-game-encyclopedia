Oh, and they abducted thousands of other citizens too but we're more worried about Mia. It's Valentine's Day! Of all the nights an alien invasion could've taken place. A romantic evening was all Aqualia wanted but\u00a0now she has to blast aliens.</p>\n<p>The theme was:</p>\r\nTheme:\u00a0\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udea8 (Starship Space Siren)\r\n<p>When I saw the concept of this jam I was immediately interested and the theme was easy to work with. The influence Starship\u00a0and Space had on the game is\u00a0obvious. For Siren, I chose to interpret\u00a0it as mermaid because I felt that'd be more interesting.</p>\n<p>If you're playing the downloaded version you can press ESC to quit the game.</p>\n\n<p>Music Credit:</p>\n<p>Boss Music by Ben Burnes:\u00a0http://www.abstractionmusic.com/</p>\n<p>All Other Music by Eric Matyas:\u00a0https://soundimage.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T18:34:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cce/cceaab34fe691edb45695e9d3df7d462.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
