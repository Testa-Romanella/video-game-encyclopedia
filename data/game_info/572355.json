I had originally planned to make a roguelike dungeon crawler, but I wasn't able to get it to a satisfactory level of completeness by the end of the jam period. Rather than submitting a half-finished game, I thought I would at least upload a standalone related project that I've been working on as part of that game.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a small web app that generates random wizard names from a list of funny words I've been assembling in the background while working on the main game. I had been thinking of random name generation systems for a while for a different project, but a roguelike seemed like the perfect place to implement random character name generation. Plus, it gave me a chance to combine some of my greatest loves: game design, D&amp;D flavor, and spending an unconscionable amount of time writing a program to generate dumb words for my own amusement.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T05:47:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d0/6d039c2cd59eb803afed468741ec60a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adam Rumpf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
