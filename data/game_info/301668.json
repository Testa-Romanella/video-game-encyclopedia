The main attribute of a tile is his contribution (Im not sure that this is the right english translation of the german word... but we call it this way). The contribution and the gain of contribution per round interacts with the abjection and education of a tile an with the contribution of the neighbouring tiles.... and so one.</p>\n<p>You have to hold the contribution on a high level at each tile, while you build temples on the map. You influence the tiles with some actions. Thats all. Its pretty hard!</p>\n\n\n<p>We want to make Kult a better game, so here is a sneak peak what will happen in the future:</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0english translation (yep, its just playable in german right now... sorry :/)</li><li>\u00a0better looking UI (damn, its soo ugly\u00a0 - and just work fine with 1920x1080 px!)</li><li>\u00a0better soundmanaging</li><li>\u00a0custom playmodes</li><li>\u00a0easyer start conditions (at the moment you need 4 or 5 trys to get a chance to win the game)</li></ol>\n\n\n<p>Have fun to play this small \"throw something against the wall\" game - and stay tuned, a english translation will come soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T02:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db2bc680aa6366e9141ffef039f90efc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spamham"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
