First full Unreal Engine project and my first 3D project.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing :)</p>\n\n<p>....Yes the Exe is called Assignment 2 I am sorry...it was my 2nd Assignment and changing names broke Unreal when trying to package the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:03:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/518ad2bf9c9de92c1ca85b8024d5d960.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamesbySaul"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
