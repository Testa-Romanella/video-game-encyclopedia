The game's art was made from scratch by my girlfriend, while I was responsible for coding. Music came from free sources (nosoapradio and\u00a0freesound.org)</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy, and go join all those blobs!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:18:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/635/635a08fee70e7a40692d63176ef3176d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bootzin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
