I was actually meaning to compete in the Compo this time... but due to poor planning and just unable to focus this weekend, I will now be in the Jam! :D All Models, textures, scripts, animations, etc have been done by me alone. I did almost all the audio except the background music, as time ran out, and I'm submitting into the Jam, I went with an old favorite :P Enjoy!!! :D <br/><br/><br/>You play an alien creature, similar to a dog in may aspects, except!!! He can shapeshift into any object he licks!!! I present to you, the Dwog! Solve your way through the maze, as Agents try to catch you. Find your way to your next meal, and win! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e6d2b5d057e3a188b83e93fcbb767c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pandaman3D"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
