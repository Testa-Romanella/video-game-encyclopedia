You wake up alone, in a field, highly confused. There are 2 endings and 4 choices to be made. I estimate each play-through may take 10-15 minutes. <br/><br/>If you gave this game a look, thank you so much for your time and thank you for those running the game jam, it felt really freeing to be able to sit down and do something small, but creative. I loved every minute of making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T07:01:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d2f6d7cd2f756da82fcdbc663acfa0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mirta000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
