They have a chance to give you soil or water too.</p><p>You can add a max of 2 colors, if you add 3 it will just take the first 2.</p>\n<p>Planets cost 1 soil with at least 1 color, 1 water with at least 1 color to plant.</p>\n<p>Plants need to be fed 3-days with stardust (there are no days so just feed them three times by clicking on them\u00a0lol)</p>\n<p>Then your mini planet will sprout and you can click on it in the sky to see them up close!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:36:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d74/d740193ac744bc65f56ce9ef0e68afa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chriswen3d"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
