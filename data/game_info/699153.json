It has a custom respawn system, 16 levels, 12 track original soundtrack, competitive scoring, and multiple ways to play.<br/><br/>The game uses a virtual control pad but also features Gamepad support. The overlay can be disabled in the options.<br/><br/>The difficult levels are balanced with the inclusion of a simple yet unique respawn system wherein the player can leave a checkpoint at any location at any point, as long as they are on solid ground.<br/><br/>Beyond the visual aesthetic, the challenging level design, and the abundance of features, there is the fantastic soundtrack composed by James Bennett, which brings rich life to the seemingly simple three-color atmosphere.<br/><br/>LOVE was originally released in 2014 on PC through STEAM and is also available on the Nintendo Switch.<br/><br/>Fred Wood is an independent game developer from San Antonio, TX. When he's not shouting about games he loves or making new ones, he's often tinkering with all sorts of things under the banner of Mokuzai Studio.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T04:45:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c85/c8567f083a8501e97eec21ee95267533.jpg", "website": "http://love-the-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fred Wood"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Fred Wood"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
