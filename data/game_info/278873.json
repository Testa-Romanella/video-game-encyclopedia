Obviously there are gifts in the jam. But I like to think I got the theme at a deeper level. The game is definitely intended to create a social interaction between two people, thus bringing presence of each other, is in the spirit of the video Extra Credits linked to the theme of the jam.<br/><br/>Hope you guys have fun.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to my musician Daniel Docherty for the extra effort he really put into getting the music for the game done. Do check out his stuff -\u00a0https://www.danieldocherty.net/. He's an awesome musician.<br/><br/>And especial thanks to my wife! Whom without, my two year old would have deprived me of sleep and work time. She is a wonderful being to have in my life.\u00a0<br/><br/>Things that I would have added/improved had I the time:<br/>(a) reduced the amount RNG can sometimes make a level really hard. Fortunately as a party game I don't feel this is too bad a thing at current.<br/>(b) added another mechanic - mousetraps, where if one player steps on it the other has to come free them.<br/>(c) better indication of when players bump into each other.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ae/4ae40ac0949d333a36066a1182f5b875.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EvilArtBunny"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
