Fight the hordes of zombies, complete quests, and clear out the Voodoo dungeons.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Full Mojo Rampage is played from the bird&#39;s eye view. The players select one out of several Voodoo classes and their specialization by choosing their parent god and Voodoo pins. The game features a sophisticated customization system which allows the players to create completely unique characters.</p>\n<p>After creating their character, the players are put into the game&#39;s hub world, where they can take quests and upgrade their equipment and abilities. Most of the quests focus on specific item retrieval and hostage rescue. While on a quest, the players can freely explore the procedurally generated dungeon and find new equipment and weapons.</p>\n<p>Being a rogue-like game, all the loot the player finds before exiting the level can be lost upon death. There is no way to recover the loot you lost.</p>\n<p>A four-player cooperative and eight-player competitive multiplayer modes are present in the game. In co-op mode, the players descend into the dungeon altogether with the game adjusting its difficulty. In multiplayer, two teams of four players fight each other in a variety of multiplayer modes, such as Team Deathmatch, Capture The Point, and so on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T09:17:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b13/b13b1699645fb8baa1551d070ab2a100.jpg", "website": "http://www.fullmojorampage.com", "rating": 2.36, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 37, "owned": 936, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 30, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 44, "suggestions_count": 445, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 44, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Nicalis", "Over the Top Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nicalis"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
