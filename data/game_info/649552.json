Inspired by\u00a0this fantasy Famicom game I set out and made City Bird in\u00a0Unity. I haven't used unity in a while, but my programming and general computer skills have improved massively since I last used it and I didn't have that hard of a time. There is a bug where the camera makes the tilemap disappear for a second at the second checkpoint past the elevator that I have no idea how to fix.</p><p>Disclaimer: This game is not more important than your baby sister TRENTON</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T05:18:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9db8dc1eba712a7872c538103f3651e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Borco Rosso"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
