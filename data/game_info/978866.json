Decide the fate of your followers, perform eldritch rituals, and master the art of city-building in a world where the line between sanity and madness blurs. Can you endure the horrors you unleash?</p>\n<p>You are not a harbinger of destruction; but a herald of cosmic rebirth. Your purpose is not to sow chaos, but to embrace the inevitable evolution that awaits us all.<br />\nHumanity is insignificant, pitiful in its smallness. Our existence is a fleeting whisper in the cosmic winds, and only by awakening Cthulhu can we transcend our feeble existence.<br />\nIn one profound act, you can shake the foundations of the universe.<br />\nAwaken Cthulhu, for in his awakening lies the catalyst for a cascading effect that will reshape the cosmos and a new order shall emerge.<br />\nThe path ahead is treacherous, fraught with challenges. Yet, it is the only path worth treading. Forge a destiny that transcends the mundane!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2024-03-23T17:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4c6/4c650f403f674f45db7ff32e06bd0d27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crazy Goat Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Crazy Goat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
