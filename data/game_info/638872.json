Don't explode.</p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD to move\r\n</li><li>Left click to shoot\r\n</li><li>Right click to reverse polarity\r\n</li></ul>\n\n\r\nTheme\r\n<p>Opposites Attract: Our first idea for Xander Jam 4 was \"magnets\" and we used it. We didn't have an artist and none of us can draw so we decided to make the game with simple shapes. And a lot of explosions. What has more explosions than the inside of a particle accelerator?<br/></p>\n<p>Switch: We noticed GeoJam 2021 was happening the same time as Xander Jam. Both starting and ending at the same time, and our game fitting both themes. Both hosts were ok with entering the same game so we did.</p>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Programming : Kira</li><li>Sound &amp; Music : Ryan<br/></li><li>Special thanks to Aty, Letholor, Brett</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T05:01:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/29085b476321781ccae9dcd3de4322ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Akuma Kira", "RyanDS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
