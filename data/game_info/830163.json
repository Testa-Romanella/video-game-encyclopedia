The game consists of 3 unique chapters: Chapter 1, Chapter 2 - Retribution, and Chapter 3 - Insurgence.<br/><br/>Each chapter the game features includes at least 10-30 minutes of gameplay, with each chapter including at least 1 Steam achievement.<br/><br/>The chapters are listed below:<h3>Chapter 1</h3>Run from the dancer in an abandoned asylum whilst trying to collect keys so you can escape the horrors of that which lurks in the shadows - the dancer.<h3>Chapter 2 - Retribution</h3>You're on a mission. Collect fuel for your helicopter in a town overrun by dancers. Play in a small open world where threat could be around every corner.<h3>Chapter 3 - Insurgence</h3>After carrying out your plan, you infiltrate the dancer mothership with the intent of destroying it.
