Yeah, someone poisoned dolphins. Pretty gross!!</p>\n<p>So rather than make light of literal animal poisonings, I decided to make a light game about an eight year old conspiracy theorist who is SURE that this aquarium has dolphins, no matter what her parents say.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately due to the technical limitations of the program used to create this game (Adventure Game Studio) it is currently only playable on a Windows operating system. I'm sure that more platforms will become available in future.</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter at @bideobames if you'd like to see more of my work, including in-progress screenshots of my next game projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T04:03:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/603/603b4a74db7c2d67e41ec96a0195f697.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ellie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
