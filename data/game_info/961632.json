Here, you\u2019ll start your journey from Cinderstone, a cozy medieval town right in the middle of the continent. From there, you\u2019ll move onto Anwyn \u2013 a mystical place with floating islands.

Be the first to discover new areas and share your discoveries with your friends.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>A Captivating Story</h3>Just like the epic mythic tales of old folklore, you\u2019ll be able to experience the same in this new, exciting adventure. It starts as a small farmer who must embark on a journey to become the ultimate hero that everyone is counting on. When powerful menacing gods suddenly appear from a parallel universe \u2013 only you, the hero, can change the fate of the lands! The question is \u2013 will you be the one who saves the people and brings peace back? Only time will tell. Convince the Gods not to bring chaos and send them back to where they came from. It will not be easy \u2013 you\u2019ll need all the help you can get.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Dynamic Quest Lines</h3>Get ready to be brought into a world that needs your help, with dynamic quest lines that will send you on one epic adventure. The opportunities are endless, where you can go on missions with thousands of other players to save the world, defend cities from mighty monsters, help build merchant nodes by collecting and donating materials, save NPCs who are in great danger, and so much more. Only by working together with other players can your adventure be victorious with glorious rewards waiting for you at the end!<br/><br/>The best part is there\u2019s always new things to do in Cinderstone Online. No session will ever be the same, with a vibrant world that changes based on players\u2019 actions.<br/><br/><h3>A Dynamic Farm And Housing System</h3>Your house is your sanctuary \u2013 a place you need all the recovery you can get before returning to the world of adventure. That\u2019s why we\u2019re giving total customization of where you want your house located (by the sea, in the mountains, in the city) and how you want to build it (exterior or interior) \u2013 the choice is yours! If you feel like an experienced farmer, try growing a vegetable garden that can be sold for money to buy new armor, weapons or items to decorate your home. Alternatively, use your harvest to craft magic potions, food, and other inventory that will be key to take on your next voyage!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Conquer The Biggest Of Castles</h3>Ever wonder what it feels like to be a conqueror, a king, or a leader of a great guild? You\u2019ll be happy to know that the lands of Cinderstone are thriving with castles that have yet to be conquered. Do so by leading your guild to glory by taking control of giant castles, then turn it into your own living-breathing territory with taxes, buffs, and upgrades for the city or outposts. Based on your actions, the people will love you or hate you for the tyrant you can become. Just remember \u2013 don\u2019t make too many enemies, otherwise other guilds are going to come knock down your walls and conquer your territory for themselves.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Built On A \u201cCaravan System\u201d</h3>You\u2019ll be able to choose from a variety of roles, each having a direct impact on the way you play the game. The roles you can choose from are plenty, with the main ones being a trader, a guardian, or a thief. As you journey across distant lands and travel from city to city with your wagon, you can buy crops from other players or sell the fruits of your garden. But be careful \u2013 the more valuable goods you bring, the harder your journey will be, with thieves on the lookout to steal anything they can get their hands on. <br/>Other players can turn into thieves as well, waiting to attack and steal your precious cargo, then selling it on the black market. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always best if you leave with a big load, you\u2019ll want to seek outside help from other \u201cguardian\u201d players who will protect you at all costs, as long as they get a percentage of your sales. This is one example of many of just how dynamic and exciting the Cinderstone Online universe can be.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-02T04:41:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/936/9363d3649418fc4d2b05016fa6b3faa1.jpg", "website": "http://cinderstoneonline.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 429, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Codevision"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Codevision"], "esrb_rating": null}
