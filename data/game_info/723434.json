A fast paced top down shooter with stylized pixel art.</p>\n<p>Made in one week\u00a0for the \"Real Friendly Game Jam 2022\". The idea came from all the games that made me feel bad for not having all the achievements (just ALL off them) u.u. (You know if you finished if you done\u00a0all the achievements\u00a0in the top left screen corner and now it is showing \"YOU WON\").</p>\n<p>A (little) more buggy on the web version, if you can I suggest to play on the windows.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it!
