I decided to make a game based a round little robot that is forced to complete dangerous test rooms, until they reach breaking point. So the robot gets more angry because of the chain of events causing him to break and attack his master. unfortunately wasn't able to finish the game in time to the standard i wanted to but will continue to work on it. As a novice to game development, learned alot. Thank god for you tube tutorials<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:14:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f01/f01e6a015eb2ceacbe3a74fcf3e736f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pennant_designs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
