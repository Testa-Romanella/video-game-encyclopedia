By doing one simple task repeatedly, similar to repeating a mantra, we liberate our mind from the association with thoughts. When getting rid of fluctuations in our tranquility, we can recharge ourselves to once again be better able to do our task and fulfill our goals in life.<br/><br/>More competitive natures might care about the score and try to reach a higher highscore each time (and perhaps unlock the rewards for doing so). Others might just enjoy to play as long as possible. Whatever the case, to ensure concentration, this game is rather difficult. You cannot make two mistakes in a row and to ensure you get enough time bonus to continue, you must tap multiple squares at the same time. (You can use a swipe gesture to do that.)<br/><br/>You can also enable and disable haptic feedback (available if you have a newer iPhone) - whichever feels best for you.<br/><br/>If you have feedback, bug reports or suggestions, please send an email to theoryapps@gmail.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:07:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b5/7b5f83a31d4b6da5612302bb7a8462fb_Le84DXS.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lukas Zielinski"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Lukas Zielinski"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
