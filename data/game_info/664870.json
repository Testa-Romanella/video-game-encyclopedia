You play as a feminine guy that looks like a gal, and you do lewd things with guys, gals, monster guys, monster gals, and... slimes? It&#39;s a stance-based RPG with rogue-lite elements and a frankly suspicious number of phallus(es? odes?) written, drawn, and programmed by us, the Majalis team, consisting of two programmers, one artist, one writer - making in all, two! It&#39;s a custom built game using libgdx.</p>\n<p>If you like feminine characters with dongs, you&#39;ve come to the right place. However, this game has very few hermaphroditic characters.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re currently in a beta release phase, so the major systems are done and we&#39;re mostly adding new features and content.</p>\n<p>Some game features (not all currently implemented):</p>\n<pre><code>Animated combat sprites for characters and enemies  \nAnimations and CG-style sets for out of battle lewd scenes  \nA story mode as well as a free-form play mode  \nLight WRPG-style character customization  \nChallenges and lewd achievements\n</code></pre>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-19T05:32:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18e/18e3e572d4aa38bb12de08021da49b2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
