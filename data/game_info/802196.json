{"id": 802196, "slug": "light-interference-test", "name": "Light Interference Test", "name_original": "Light Interference Test", "description": "<p>This puzzle game consists of 13 levels which utilise lasers, walls, and prisms to get a beam of light of a specific colour into the target block.</p>\n<p>~~~~~</p>\n<p>Lasers shoot beams of light in straight lines, in a given colour. These photons will pass through others of the same colour, but annihilate if different colours collide. If a photon beam hits a laser, the colour of the laser will change depending on the combination of the RGB values of the light values. Lasers can be toggled on or off, with the exception of lasers with a thick black border which are locked permanently on.</p>\n<p>Walls can be placed and removed from the level (using LMB and RMB respectively), which destroy all photons hitting it.</p>\n<p>Prisms, like walls, can be placed and removed, however they can be cycled through (SCROLL WHEEL) depending on what is available in the level. Prisms have an input, indicated by a line, and output, indicated by a triangle. If multiple inputs are present, the prism will combine the colour values much like with lasers. If multiple outputs are present, photons will be emitted from all.</p>\n<p>~~~~~</p>\n<p>This game was made as part of my A-Level Computer Science course using python and pygame</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T11:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16a/16aa7f92c96a9105633fe96ca5d11a11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kannen Joshi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
