However, you need to be careful with the over-friendly seals. They are huggable, but they hurt!</p><p>Controls: use the mouse in the menu and the arrow keys to play the game.</p><p>This game was made for the first Kong Game Jam at Kongregate. The theme was attraction. So, inspired by the game \"Binary Land\", my colleague and I created our version of it, in which one penguin attracts the other in a romantic way.</p><p>Both of us programmed and did all the pixel art. The game won the Judge's Choice award \"Best Awww Moment\"! And as it was our first project as a duo, it was an incredible surprise to win an award! </p><p>We are planning to continue this project, so you may hear about it again in the future!</p><p>Thank you for playing our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b20/b20674fe8e7cdf3ddb7586fcdc8e6ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Palups", "Mylla Sasaki"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
