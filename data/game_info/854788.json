I got the idea from the description of the jam where it says \"Fall is coming and I can smell the Pumpkin Spice Lattes\". I made 3 levels and a tutorial, every level gets harder and gets more ingredients. Some ingredients will not come directly, for example there are only 5/8 ingredients in the 1 level. I understand that the backround music is repeating.</p>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul><li>Milk</li><li>Cloves</li><li>Esspresso</li><li>Nutmeg</li><li>PumpkinPure</li><li>Pumpkin Pie Slice</li><li>Sugar</li><li>Cinnamon</li></ul>\n<p>I made the game with my teacher for coding. He also has his own game in this jam. I hope you'll like this game of mine.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the Latte!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:30:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4f/f4f1a7efac99b89d6faa3e20c8047e27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nurim"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
