Note that there may be bugs when using Google Chrome.</p>\n<p>The game does not have a goal, except maybe breed worms to get the longest one possible. I wanted to try some new things and as I did not work that much, the game is not in a very advanced state (sorry about that).</p>\n<p>Gameplay is pretty simple, click two worms to breed them, then select the heirs that will replace them in the pool. Reclicking a worm will deselect it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb42ff6ccf658468a01d4d0b0710b9ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ptafix"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
