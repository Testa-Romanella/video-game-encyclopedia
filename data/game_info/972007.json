You play as a (sometimes effective) bounty hunter with possibly questionable morals, currently in possession of a powerful little alien that you may or may not have stolen/liberated from the evil Empire. As the Empire closes in, you'll need to find a way to balance your ship's management with the onslaught of attacks. Do you have what it takes to survive?<br/><br/>\u2022 Become one with the ship: Immerse yourself in a cockpit packed full from ceiling to floor with distinct physics-based interactions (Though make sure to keep your eye on them all if you want to survive!).<br/><br/>\u2022 Rebel against The Empire: Engage in thrilling dogfights as squads of enemies pursue you to re-capture the small green treasure aboard your ship - shoot bullets, launch bombs, and raise your shields. It's going to get bumpy!<br/><br/>\u2022 Navigate the vacuum of space: Control the ship with a radical and easy-to-use virtual flight stick design, dodge your way through hazardous space environments, and don't forget to do a barrel roll!<br/><br/>\u2022 The little guy: Who could forget your cosmic friend, Ziggy?! This mysterious creature is a perfect fuel source. You can also play with them, use them as a resource, feed them, and most importantly pet them!<br/><br/>\u2022 The Journey: Fight your way through 13 unique levels total. Forge a different path each time by beating challenges and unlocking harder worlds en route.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-10T08:15:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ef/8ef099080c5adc250d71eca90b4d2c4b.jpg", "website": "https://www.stardustcollective.dev/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 408, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stardust Collective"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stardust Collective"], "esrb_rating": null}
