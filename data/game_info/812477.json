Whenever you defeat an enemy or encounter treasure, you can obtain crafting materials that can be used to make every part of your custom-made cards; from the attack and resistance of your minions to the activation conditions and effects of your card abilities!</p>\n<p>Other minor elements are also present like town building, and other other elements are planned like a more deep story involving resolving the quarrel of neighboring kingdoms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T11:08:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d2/1d29ddaa6883b6b975d21c712e4f857c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fullen"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
