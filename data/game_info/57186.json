It is the sequel to Splatterhouse 2 and was one of the first games to be given a rating by Sega's own Videogame Rating Council. In North America the game was given an MA-13 rating by the council for its graphic violence and gore. Unlike its predecessors, it was not originally released in Europe. The game was included as an unlockable extra in the 2010 remake, with new artwork replacing the digitized photographs due to legal reasons.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T01:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7e/a7e05db45ad9f572e6f8a7d80b8366dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.06, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 12, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 16, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 16, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["Now Production"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Namco"], "esrb_rating": null}
