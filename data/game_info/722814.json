It uses words from Kid's Beginner A and B books.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the games were intended to be played by groups of children in a classroom setting, therefore they may not make sense in this context. This was created to work in windows as an .EXE and never in the browser. Some bugs and unintended behavior will be present. This is mainly for my website to show some of my past work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:52:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d738b7251057205a6f66a13646d50fd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sean Red"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
