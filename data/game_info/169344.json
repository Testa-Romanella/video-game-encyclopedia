This was made over the 3 days of the jam, so it is still in the early stages. We are hoping to move forward with this game in the near future, adding levels, assets, characters, and polishing gameplay, so let us know what you think of this rough cut so far!</p><p>OBJECTIVE:</p><p>Bump, block and misdirect your opponent into traps while racing to save yourself with the only gas mask in the forest.</p><p>HOW TO PLAY:<br/></p><p>Stage 1: Setting Traps</p><p>You and your opponent are given a specific amount of points to buy traps. You can scroll through the course and lay down traps wherever you'd like. When both players have laid their traps, press the space bar to start the race.</p><p>Stage 2: The Race</p><p>It's time to run for your life! Get through the course, avoid as many traps as possible, and keep as far away from the toxic fog as you can! The more traps your opponent hits, the better for you, so bump them, misdirect them, and do anything you can to stab them in the back</p><p>CONTROLS:</p><p>Player 1: Use the WASD keys for movement, and the 1, 2 and 3 keys to lay traps.</p><p>Player 2: Use the IJKL keys for movement, and the 7, 8 and 9 keys to lay traps.</p><p>Use the space bar to start the race (once both players have laid their traps), and again to restart once the race is over.</p><p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8be/8be7d36fd1e5d05f38fd27757cb25950.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sarawilde", "Kyle Gray"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
