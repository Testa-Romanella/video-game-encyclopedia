I'm sure there's a definition that would better describe it in the world of non-videogame arcade world but my knowledge on the matter\u00a0is not very wide, so i apologize if it doesn't feel as accurate to any expert.<br/></p>\n<p>Still, the main objective of <em>Bawlzers</em> is, of course, to beat your opponent in understanding how to best move in the environment you just created for yourself, and that's where the main hook of the game comes from.</p>\n<p>Yep, because with <strong>+30\u00a0map items</strong> to choose from and <strong>4 game modes</strong>\u00a0its possible to create hundreds of different combinations of levels!</p>\n<p>You can also change the level design or the mode mid game in case you weren't satisfied at first with what you created.</p>\n<p>I hope you people have fun with <em>Bawlzers!</em></p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE SEND ME FEEDBACK OF THE GAME IF YOU FOUND ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR IF YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow my developer Youtube\u00a0channel here:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SUPPORT ME ON PATREON</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T04:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/416/416bed0333ea10e1eabe2bccaa00ef5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Time Stop"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
