The game started out as a school project and since I didn't just want to let my friends and other people in my school play it I figured I'd release it here.</li></ul><p>So the game is a little story/adventure where you have to either help the dark (the demons) or the light (the angels). You have to travel and collect the holy shard and the demonic shard so you can beat the enemy's side.</p><p>The game has a minimum of about 20 min gameplay, if you do both sides and know everything about the game. But if you are  going to read/do everything it will be 1 hour+. </p><p>Well i hope you like the game if you choose to get it.</p><p>Thank you, to all people who purchase it.</p><p>edit: i've made the game free, but i would apreciate any donations as this is a 100 hour+ project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b0/3b050cbab5848250e287db008dd96da7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sparkyro"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
