I made this so I could learn how to structure and code my future Strip Poker Games and I didn't want to just throw it away so I posted it. There are two animations that play if you make it to the end of the game.</p>\n<p>I tested it and it seems to work (on windows anyways) I am hoping that some people will play it and give me some feedback on it so my next game will be better.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any problems with this game. I would like some suggestions on how to make it better.</p>\n<p>This game contains adult material and sexual content. You must be 18 years old or older to view or play this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T10:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11a429a54810c757a70f346e87848493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["quarkyifu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
