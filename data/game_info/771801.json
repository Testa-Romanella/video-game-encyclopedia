Thank you!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>HELLO!</strong></p>\n<p>This is not only my first submission on itch.io, but it's my very first game ever made. I originally was just testing features of Godot out but when it was all said and done I ended up having a neat little project. I'm sorry for the art of it, I am no artist. The art that looks decent was actually downloaded off of itch.io, the music too!</p>\n<p><strong>THE GAME:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is a simple endless jumper, with it being randomly generated until you die. The game saves your high scores, and keeps track of an in game currency that you'll want to save up with\u00a0 so you can afford one of the many skins!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>BUGS!</strong></p>\n<p>PLEASE\u00a0LET ME KNOW IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANYTHING WONKY</p>\n<p>Like I said, this is my first game and I want to be able to go back and fix any mess I may have created.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDIT</strong>S:</p>\n<p>ART:</p>\n<p>All of the art I used, I either made or edited from other itch.io users.
