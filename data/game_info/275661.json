The novice wizards, who were quite bored in their magic studies, had different conclusions: one, those orbs would make quite a show as weapons, and two, we need a magic fight club!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Face off your friends in battles up to 4 players (humans or bots) either alone or as a team.<br/>Navigate your way through the arena, trap your enemies with magic infused exploding orbs while outsmarting them, gather power-ups to lay more orbs and give them greater reach, use your dash to avoid danger or suprise your opponents and exploit everything the arena gives you, like the way your orbs explode, your elemental spell and even some environmental hazards!<br/><br/><ul><li>Gameplay easy to learn, rich and fast-paced.<br/></li><li>1 to 4 players in free for all or team versus team.<br/></li><li>4 game modes :<br/><br/>        \u25e6 <strong>Sudden death:</strong> You\u2019ve got one life and there can only be one survivor.
