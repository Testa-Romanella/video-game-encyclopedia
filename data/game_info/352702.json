Avoid the blue banana peels and be careful of the elven monkeys by using our favourite keys, WAD (S was cut off the group for design reasons, I\u2019m sorry S ). Collect delicious apples because everyone knows that\u2019s a bunny\u2019s favourite food!   </p>\n<p>Try not to get bored by this overly simplified version of my ambitious project idea.
