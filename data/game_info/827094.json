Come in once a day and care for a lonely rabbit. What kind of person will you wind up being to him?</p>\n<p>Featuring:</p>\n<ul><li>Real-time progression: Come in once a day to keep Aleck company. It's alright to miss a day or two, though he may miss you.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Choice heavy: Every new day brings with it new decisions to make. Some may just result in small-talk, while others may have dire results.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Permanent decisions: Regardless of the choices you make, they all share one thing in common. None can be taken back. This game can only be played once, so make your choices count.</li></ul>\n<p>This is a seven-day long demo. The full game is planned to have one month worth of content. Backwards compatibility for demo saves is planned. This game must be played in real time, that means waiting a full real-life day between in-game days.</p>\n\n<p>Wishlish Luxworks on steam here:</p>\n<p>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2071650/Luxworks/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T08:32:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f8/5f8ab8f6c74b19ef6f917e7f26b373e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wrought"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
