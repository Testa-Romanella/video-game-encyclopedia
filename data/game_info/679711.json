Additionally, similar to the classic Tank Combat games, a floating tank has been added, with which our penguin fights. The gunshot is triggered when the penguin changes its direction. Only one torpedo can be used at a time. There will probably be a possibility of a duel between 2 players.</p>\n<p>There will also be versions for Linux and Android.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T08:57:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/827/827c5129145342f41dd755eb940924d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROBOSY"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
