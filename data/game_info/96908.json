{"id": 96908, "slug": "northanger-abbey-the-game", "name": "Northanger Abbey: The Game", "name_original": "Northanger Abbey: The Game", "description": "<p>Northanger Abbey: The Game! Experience Jane Austen's classic satirical romance in a whole new way. Dance, love, and discover the secrets of the Abbey. Choose one of three genders and five love/friendship interests, and see what lies beyond the pages of the novel.</p>\n<p>Still very much in production, but I'd love to hear people's feedback on what I have thus far!</p>\n<p>The main character is Christopher/Kit/Catherine, a 17 year old romantic hoping to find love on their first trip to Bath. They can be male/female/non binary and present as male/female/genderqueer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are five possible love interests:</p>\n<ul><li>Henry Tilney: A snarky priest with an eye for muslin.</li><li>Eleanor Tilney: An artist with a quiet, dry wit.</li><li>Evelyn Stratford: An androgynous\u00a0figure of mysterious intent.</li><li>Isabella Thorpe: Your new best friend, whether you like it or not.</li><li>John Thorpe: ... he really likes horses.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>All paths can be platonic or romantic. The game is intended to have screen reader support, but this has not been thoroughly tested.</p>\n<p>Below is the link to the demo, if you're feeling brave check out the latest build.</p>\n<p>Note: Although overall fluffy and light, this game is set in the 19th century, and I haven't entirely softened the sharp edges of history. Also, the main character was a cis woman in the original text, and traces of this remain regardless of how the character identifies in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/072/0723de9475d717b760d958ae26598ddf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Spiral Atlas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
