{"id": 18517, "slug": "gungirl-2", "name": "GunGirl 2", "name_original": "GunGirl 2", "description": "Main Features<strong>Put Some G-Power In Your Weapons</strong><br/>GG2 offers 6 main weapons, each has a unique feel, ammunition, an alternate fire mode, a variety of unique power-ups and you can even level them up. Every time you kill enemies, they will drop small G letters. Collect them to power up your weapons to make them more and more deadly over time. But be aware! Each time an enemy hits you, you will lose a certain amount of G-Power.<br/><br/><strong>Explore New Worlds</strong><br/>The game starts off in a small building, from which you have to escape. The more you explore, the more will the world open up. Get more and more items and power-ups that will give you the necessary abilities to reach new places. Find abandoned subway-stations to travel to far-away new places or go through portals and travel across the hellish parallel-dimension!<br/><br/><strong>Power-Up Your Character</strong><br/>Another feature is the Power-Up system. Whenever you obtain special Power-Orbs in the game, you can use them in your status screen to upgrade ascpects, weapons or items of your character. You decide if a weapon should have more power, bigger clip size, faster fire rate etc, or if you need more protection, or better health supplies. Spend your Power-Orbs wisely to become more versatile or focus them to become a specialized killing machine.<br/><br/><strong>Advanced Blood &amp; Gore FX</strong><br/>When I go see a zombie movie and there are no bucketloads of blood in it, I would say \u201cHey mister, cool flick, but where\u2019s the damn blood?\u201d. To avoid such emails from angry players, GunGirl 2 offers a whole ton of high-quality blood effects to please all zombie fans!<br/><br/><strong>Lots of Quests</strong><br/>There are several main- and sub-quests in the game. You can get them from surviving npcs or even from unholy items and they have smaller or bigger impacts on the story. They are NOT grind-quests to cheat a longer playtime! That\u2019s a no-go<br/><br/><strong>High Replayability Value</strong><br/>If the 4-8 hours of playtime (on normal mode) aren\u2019t enough for your zombiekilling-desire, the game offers a total of 3 difficulty settings (from Normal to Iron Maiden), unlockable playmodes and even a secret character!<br/><br/><strong>Music by Josh Whelchel</strong><br/>This guy is pure gold. He made some of the most memorable soundtracks for indie-games such as Bonesaw or The Spirit Engine 2 and now he has blessed this game with another awesome soundtrack :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-25T17:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a5c41eaef97cf552bee18204da35277.jpg", "website": "http://www.gungirl2.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 161, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueEagle Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Paul Schneider"], "esrb_rating": null}
