Unfortunately, being in the woods surrounded by bears is not the place for this. In this game you must scavenge around the map for weapons and power-ups to be able to fight off the attacking bears after your life while at the same time scavenging for car parts to repair the only means of your escape, a run down car desperately in need of repairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use whatever you can to fight off the enemy. Pick up guns, swords, dead bears, and utilize them to the fullest to your survival. When you get in a tight situation, throw the gun at the bears to knock them back. Even throw their own comrades at them to knock them back!</p>\n<p>Side Note: I had made this project last year in high school and I am looking to see what kind of feedback I might get on it / what I can improve on it. Any feedback is welcome, Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T06:46:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ae/2aed8670e65e7852a79d28d4f66da1d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimmyBobbi"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
