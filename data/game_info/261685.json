Fight your way through 5 different time zones, defeat powerful bosses and rescue parachutists. Each time zone has its special feature. So biplanes throw bombs and helicopters fire rockets at you. Jet pilots and UFOs even shoot steerable missiles pursuing your aircraft.<br/><br/>If you have survived all five time zones, the game begins again with even more enemies and faster pilots. The ever-increasing difficulty ensures long-lasting fun.<br/><br/>There are three difficulty levels to choose from:<br/>- Normal (5 aircraft , starting at level 1, 3 enemy hits per aircraft)<br/>- Arcade (3 aircraft , starting at level 1, 1 enemy hit per aircraft)<br/>- Nightmare (1 aircraft , starting in the most difficult level, 1 enemy hit per aircraft)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T01:45:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c04/c0406ab8bcd4c1d9ac705bf3e16a21f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Peter Gunn"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Peter Gunn"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
