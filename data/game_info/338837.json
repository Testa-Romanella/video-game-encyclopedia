The revolutionary arcade game, immersive like no other. Be careful though, it's easy to get sucked into if you play it too long...</p>\n<p>This game is an entry for the Evolution Jam hosted by GrandMaster101. The theme was to recreate an old game in a new genre; IE: Pacman as a horror game. The game was created from start to finish in the span of 8 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Escape Faceman's maze. Use your flashlight to light the path ahead of you (F) and place breadcrumbs (LMB) so you don't lose your bearings. Maps are scattered around the level showing the path to the exit. Be careful, because using your flashlight, sprinting, and placing breadcrumbs will attract Faceman to your location, and could easily lead to your untimely demise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are loud noises, flashing lights, jumpscares, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SELF-PROMOTION</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Check out my main project, Narwhal Heist!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T04:29:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4ea97a236feed750e0c76f736f80065.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gurbofrogman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
