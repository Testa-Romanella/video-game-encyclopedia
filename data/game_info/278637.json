Player stacks and tries to balance the pebbles\u00a0on top of each other, erecting totems to trigger natural incidents, such as volcano eruption, rainy storm, tornado with autumn leaves, earthquake,\u00a0snowy Christmas and Tsunami. Each stacking combination awakens a different reaction from the habitat.\u00a0If the pebbles\u00a0can stay balanced for a couple of seconds,\u00a0the player is rewarded\u00a0with colorful marbles falling out of the sky. If the player can win six of the marbles, then the game is complete. It is a small\u00a0tactile game with cute and funny aesthetics, however balancing the pebbles is much more challenging then expected!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc8e5e7c9d2b6605fc4a7c8261fae136.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Su K\u0131z\u0131la\u011fa\u00e7"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
