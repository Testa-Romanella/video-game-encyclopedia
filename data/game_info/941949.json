After six weeks of no communication, \u201cthe Martian Interplanetary Supergroup Supervising Industrial Logistics &amp; Extraction\u201d (MISSILE) sent a Specialist to investigate the problem and resolve it through any means necessary\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>The project was initially conceptualized and designed by a team of four students. We took inspiration from classic arcade games and created a unique take on the classic shooter genre. The goal was to create a game that was accessible to all types of players, from casual to hardcore. Throughout the development process, we iterated on the design and mechanics to ensure a fun and challenging experience. We utilized industry-standard software, such as Unity and Photoshop, Substance designer and Visual Studio\u00a0to bring our game to life. After three weeks of hard work, we are proud to present our final product.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T12:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/969b9a03189da6ea26a7a6b7e8f61749.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathan3197", "Neighbourhood Snake"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
