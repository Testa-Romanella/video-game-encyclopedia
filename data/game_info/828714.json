You will die inevitably, but at least you have the chance to go down with a bang!<br/><br/>==========Controls:==========</p>\n<p>When you are in the air, you have to use your water gun to move around. Not only do you have to shoot out enemies, you also have to use the recoil of your weapon to move. \u00a0To aim, move your mouse around. CLICK to shoot. Shooting takes water away from your water bottle: if it's empty, you just can't shoot!\u00a0But you can take the plunge underwater to refill the water bottle.\u00a0When you are underwater, use W, A and D to move around. But do not dive into the deep waters\u00a0for safety - even though drones can't reach you there, you will encounter another, deadlier hazard. Also, your gun doesn't work underwater.</p>\n<p>Use SHIFT to slow down time around you, and maybe relocate to a safer position. But remember, your sixth sense will have to recharge after some time, so use it wisely.</p>\n<p>======How it fits the theme?======</p>\n<p>Below the main battlefield, you will find the <strong>deep waters</strong>: the drones can't go below the water, but enemy submarines will try to nuke the life out of you. When you are above the water, you use your gun as a <strong>multi-purpose tool:\u00a0</strong>you use it to shoot enemies and fly around the arena. But underwater, it is worthless, so fighting there is not an option. You can, however, escape tight situations by activating your <strong>sixth sense:\u00a0\u00a0</strong>slow down time around you, but preserve your own speed.</p>\n<p>=============Dev time?========</p>\n<p>9 hours sharp.</p>\n<p>============Questions?========</p>\n<p>Ask down below, in the comment section.</p>\n<p>(Don't judge too hard, it's my first gamejam and I'm trash at graphics)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T05:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78f7c24641c82784e76e250f0aec22c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beanboy228"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
