Still a demo, or vertical slice, my goal here was to try and get good feeling movement, and juicy, cathartic combat. <br/><br/>Depending on reception, I'll either continue to make tweaks, or move on to building a full game with levels and bosses! <br/><br/>Thank you for playing!<br/><br/>Controls:<br/><br/>Keyboard-<br/></p>\n<p>Z = Dash<br/>X = Attack/Select<br/>C = Jump<br/>Arrow keys = Move<br/>Esc = Pause/skip cutscenes<br/><br/>Gamepad (assuming Xbox layout)<br/><br/>B = Dash<br/>A = Jump<br/>X = Attack/Select<br/>D-Pad = Move<br/>Start = Pause/skip cutscenes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f56dd371ffc62503c5d1945c4d5eb58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tom Oliver"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
