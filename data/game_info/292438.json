You can program the robots with your remote control. However, the catch is that the robots must follow the instruction sequence you see next to you. Your task is to determine which robot(s) should follow that sequence. If a robot finishes the sequence or cannot follow the next step, it stops and can be commanded to follow the sequence again from the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>You need HTC Vive to play. Otherwise you will only </strong><strong>see a black screen.</strong></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming, 2D and 3D Art: Lauri Leponiemi, Lauri Kosonen<br/>Additional 3D Art: Lassi Rinne<br/>Sound Effects: Taaniel Teiss<br/>Special thanks to everyone at Leonidas Oy</p>\n\n\n<p>Created during Global Game Jam 2018</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T03:28:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebf/ebfebff9166782bb7840cd51a224ab68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arkisto"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
