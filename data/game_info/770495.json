The difficulty increases\u00a0with time and you will have to loop in order to lower the rate at which entities spawn.<br/>- Get as much completion as you can in the least possible time / number of loops.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Controls</strong><strong>Key</strong>\n<strong>Action</strong>\r\nArrow keys\r\nMovementSpaceDashE\r\nFlip a tileEnterLoopPPause + settingsBackspaceStart a new game</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Better in full screen.</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Tips <br/>-\u00a0</strong>Mouse is not required, but you might have to click within the game when the page loads to give focus.<br/>- Abuse the dash by pressing space in order to get out of hard situations but also\u00a0to compete with the difficulty increasing over time.<br/>- Highlighted tiles always flip correctly, if you missflip an adjacent tile and it is incorrect, you will hear it and also see it in progression. You may also keep flipping it until it's the correct pattern but it is risky and not very rewarding.<br/>- If you feel it gets too hard, please loop by using Enter (otherwise this game has no theme :D), also it is probably hard anyway. You may also use it as a panic button, but note it won't lower the difficulty anymore if you used it too much.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Credits\r\n<br/>\n</strong>-\u00a0Engine:\u00a0https://ebiten.org/<br/>-\u00a0SFX:\u00a0https://sfxr.me/<br/>-\u00a0Source:\u00a0https://github.com/Zyko0/BlackAndWhite8</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:39:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e8/3e83ea459d27ef05ae8c41c2768e2e19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zyk0"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
