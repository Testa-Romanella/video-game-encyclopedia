I beat it one 60 fps.<br/><br/><strong>FIRST PERSON TO FINISH THIS GAME WITH VIDEO PROOF GETS PUT IN THE DESCRIPTION HERE!!!</strong><br/><br/>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>F - Toggle Gravity Direction</p>\n<p>This is a difficult game. If you beat it I'll be pretty happy about that. Some of the hit-boxes i noticed were different from the unity runtime. Which was odd. but i managed to beat it still in the web-player. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>First level is completed. The other two house the alternate songs.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PROCESS</strong><br/>I spent a day one the 3 songs.<br/></p>\n<p>Originally a shooting system was in place but i had to cut it for time.</p>\n<p>I'm really proud how this turned out. I'm learning so much with these jams. I'm happy to be here. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>BUGS</strong><br/>Once again there is some bugs that appeared after testing this webGL version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Pausing doesn't stop the character for an odd reason. Just reset the level from there.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T15:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba9186b530b4dc1f9e454f871aa213a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Jago1996"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
