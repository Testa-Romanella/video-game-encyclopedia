As a result, there is only one character in the entire game,\u00a0as every enemy is a copy of the player!</p>\n<p>Gameplay - ONLY ONE STAT BAR: As a result of the cloning process, you have come to rely on a new energy source to survive: GOOP! Goop acts as both your health points and the ammo source for your gun, making it the only player stat in the game. Thus, every time you shoot, you inch closer to death, and every time you restore your health, you can fire more shots.</p>\n<p>Because the player's health and ammo are one in the same, they must shoot sparingly and accurately in order to stay alive and reach the facility's exit, fighting through hoards of clones and picking up Goop and other collectibles along the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/139e31096dc43d7f5ec60a033d5d9b46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris Trenary"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
