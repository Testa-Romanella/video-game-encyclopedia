The goal is to reach the end of the level as\r\nquickly as possible. During each level the player must avoid\r\nobstacles while trying to stay on the track. This game is made more\r\nunique by the fact that this car is a hover-car that can adjust its\r\ngravity to that of whatever surface it is riding on. If the track\r\ngoes sideways, the car goes sideways.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:38:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b55c2a6aee0737c95b2846bd43b48867.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["wanicdigipen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
