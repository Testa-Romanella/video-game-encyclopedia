What you're about to experience is a game made in the short, moonlit space between finishing playing PubG and finally going to bed*.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, even though it was midnight, I inexplicably took the time to make it compatible with game controllers. It made sense at the time.</p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>\n<p>*It takes Rockstar like what, 3 years to make a game? So actually I think smashing one out right before bed is pretty impressive.
