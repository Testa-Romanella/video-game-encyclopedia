In Dungeon Lord, a single player, turn-based, fantasy card game, you take a team of adventurers into the dungeon to find fame and loot. Defeat powerful enemies and devious traps using enchanted weapons and magical spells. Featuring short, addictive gameplay, Dungeon Lord is easy to play, and hard to put down. Can you become... the Dungeon Lord?<br/><br/>Featuring two distinct game modes:<br/><br/>- STANDARD MODE: Take your team of adventurers into the dungeon to score the most loot in this classic, no frills mode. You get one chance. One level. In and out. Can you beat 1 billion gold? We did.<br/><br/>- DUNGEON DELVE: In this campaign mode, you try to take your team of adventurers as DEEP AS YOU CAN GO. Inspired by the classic, \"Diablo\", you start at Level 1 and try to work your way down to harder and more deadly dungeons. Your Heroes level up, gain loot, and discover new spells. But so do the Monsters. Facing increasingly difficult traps, a new Fatigue mechanic, and new enemies, each Dungeon Delve will be unique. You will never face the same dungeon twice! Becoming the Dungeon Lord is more difficult than ever!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- Single-player, turned-based strategy<br/>- Dynamic deck building<br/>- Turn-based gameplay<br/>- Endless dungeon levels<br/>- Discover Powerful weapons, spells and magic items<br/>- Quick, 5-10 minute playtime<br/><br/>---------------------<br/><br/>Dungeon Lord is a passion project of mine.

And I will never throw ads in your face.
