Including our lover.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What if there is a door that can lead us to a world full of times ?</p>\n<p>What if we can catch some of those times, with bubble ? Why bubble though ?</p>\n<p>If it's me, I would surely use those times to spend just\u00a0with someone dearest to me. This is a game about that. Hope you like it despite being very short and perhaps not that difficult.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Font :\u00a0Daniel Linssen</p>\n<p>Music :\u00a0Kevin MacLeod (Song title : Eastern Thought &amp; Nu Flute)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:13:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9e8368d766976c6f51f30318bfe334b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["syauqihh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
