Although starting out simple, it can quickly ramp up into a difficult and rewarding little puzzle game. Featuring music from Professional Dreamer.</p>\n<p>The game was developed for <strong>android mobile</strong> platforms, on purchase you will be provided an APK to install on your phone.<br/><br/>The game features <strong>4 main modes</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>2D Shapes:</strong> A classic sliding 9 block puzzle, tap the block to move it into an empty position and solve the board!</li><li><strong>Colors:</strong> Taking the concept of the first mode and bringing it into the 3D world, we have colors! In this mode you unscramble the cube to have each block in the correct position.</li><li><strong>Flags:</strong> Do you know your flags? You may not technically NEED to know your flags to be able to complete this mode but it helps, similar to the previous mode however instead of colors on each side, it's flags! Who doesn't love flags!</li><li><strong>Invert</strong>: By far the hardest one, blocks will light up when in the correct position and be dark when they are in the wrong position. Use your memory and puzzle solving prowess to make it out of this labyrinth of a cube!</li></ul>\n<p>Pokioh will continue to be updated, for news on updates check back here or on our subreddit or our newly created\u00a0instagram (@divisionAtlas)</p>\n<p><strong>Bugs &amp; Other Issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>If you are using the PC there may be aspect ratio and resolution issues however it comes with a re-sizable window. If you have issues resize the window to the desired height and width.</li><li>The 3D scroller bars sometimes do not leave the screen on level end.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T01:39:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e7/5e7324983ea7260e04b4ed6217abe421.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Division Atlas"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
