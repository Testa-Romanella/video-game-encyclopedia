To save it,\u00a0<strong>you'll need to assign controls</strong>\u00a0to your smaller units that are, by default,\u00a0<strong>out of control</strong>\u00a0and try to\u00a0<strong>destroy the enemy Mothership!</strong></p>\n<p>You can only assign<strong>\u00a0a limited number of controls\u00a0</strong>to<strong>\u00a0ONE ship per turn\u00a0</strong>(by stacking up to 4 controls at a time). It means your other ships will often be out of control. Think carefully about what you're doing!</p>\n<p>To make things even more out of controls,\u00a0<strong>random \"out of control events\"</strong>\u00a0(such as \"a strong wind\") are added to the mix and can mess up your well-crafted master plan.  It creates a\u00a0<strong>risk and reward gameplay</strong>\u00a0where you need to balance the efficiency of stacking a high number of orders on your ships with the risk of seeing the whole sequence messed up by a strong wind, sending your beloved ships crashing on each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<p>1) Select one of your smaller units (your mothership is out of control, remember) and stack up to 4 control on it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) Then click \"End Turn\".</p>\n<p>3) After that,\u00a0<strong>every ship will resolve the control</strong>\u00a0you assigned them or\u00a0<strong>will simply move in the direction they're facing if they're out of order!</strong></p>\n<p>4) Repeat until you destroy the enemy mothership!\u00a0</p><p><strong>Commands:</strong></p>\n<p>- You can choose to let your ship move forward in the direction it faces</p>\n<p>- You can choose to rotate to the left or the right and move forward</p>\n<p>- If something got in the way of your plan, you can reset your command stack, but it will use an action!</p>\n<p><strong>How do I destroy those nasty enemy ships?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>When ships find a target in range (usually 2 squares) on their sides (or cross the way of another ship), it fires.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And when ships finish on the same space as another they'll get destroyed. Well, except Mothership... They're way too big to care.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p><p>-<strong> Left click </strong>to select a ship (when the square is green).\u00a0</p><p>- <strong>Directional Arrows and Page Up/Down</strong> - Move the free camera</p><p> - <strong>Space</strong> - Snap onto Mothership</p>\n<p>Known issues:\u00a0<br/>You can't change a control you just assigned (sorry we ran out of time).<br/>(still) The Global Warming</p>\r\nCredits:\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>Animator: </strong>Xu\u00e3nlan</p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong>\u00a0marcel.lenoir,\u00a0HolyNgel,\u00a0Sirhaian</p>\n<p><strong>Design &amp; Prod:\u00a0</strong>Herve Gengler</p>\n<p><strong>Programming:</strong>\u00a0kirub,\u00a0Maxime Piquot</p>\n<p><strong>Sound:</strong>\u00a0Nicolas de Ferran (Sowatt)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:51:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f67895fc87a34463557f5aadf1780a62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sirhaian", "kirub", "Herve Gengler", "NebulaCollectif", "HolyNgel", "Sowatt", "marcel.lenoir", "Maxime Piquot"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
