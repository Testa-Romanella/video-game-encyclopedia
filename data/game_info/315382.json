In order to play a card from your hand you sacrifice the same amount of life from<br/>your own total.</p>\n<p><strong>ATTACK</strong><br/>The green number on the bottom left of your card is its attack value. When you attack your opponent's cards or his health core, this is the amount of damage the card does. If your card is attacked by your opponent, it will defend itself, causing damage to the attacking card as well.</p>\n<p><strong>COOLDOWN</strong><br/>Every card has a cooldown, indicated by the timer symbol on the top left. As long as a card is in cooldown, it remains tabbed. On your next turn, your cards' cooldowns are decreased by one.</p>\n<p><strong>LIFESTEAL</strong><br/>Some cards posses the power to steal life, indicated by a red blood droplet in the top right. Any damage dealt by a card with lifesteal is added to your health pool, allowing you to regenerate.</p>\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL DRAWS</strong><br/>Some cards - when played from your hand - allow you to draw an extra card.<br/>This is indicated by an image of a blank card in the top right.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>You can exit the game at any time by pressing Escape.<br/>To view a larger version of your card, hover over a card and keep your right mouse button down.</p>\n\n\n<p>Cat'sn'Wheels Studios</p>\n<p>Made with \u2764\ufe0e\u00a0 using Unity, Blender, Krita, GIMP, Audacity and VS2019</p>\n<p>textures.com - freesound.org - bensound.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T10:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f4824db6080beb0fa15c343c5238b481.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Klaus Klapper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
