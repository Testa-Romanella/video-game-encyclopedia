Show off the qualities of an excellent leader, as you will become the head of the car factory. It is up to you what will the future of the automotive industry look like.<br/><br/><br/>You will participate in the process of creating a car from the beginning to the end. Test manufactured cars as soon as they leave the production line.<br/><br/><br/>Behind every car you create are people, more or less experienced. It is your responsibility to make the factory run at full capacity. Assign tasks accordingly to the skills of employees.<br/><br/><br/>The development of the production line is the keystone.
