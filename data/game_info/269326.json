It sends a young Mage recently returned from magic school delving into their family\u2019s fraught past. While the Mage was away learning the difference between dark and light magic, the family squandered away their large fortune and rapidly lost their home to Mordred, a sneaky, spiritual debt collector. Now it\u2019s up to the player to find enough hidden treasure in the castle and its grounds to pay off the debt and win back their own home. Move through the castle creating as much havoc as possible using the Mage\u2019s special wand magic in a desperate bid to unlock the family home -- but look out for other-worldly ancestors!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-12T13:16:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3d/c3d24ec9241bf2d9b2f74f76b47bbd95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Triangular Pixels"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
