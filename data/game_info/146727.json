With this discovery, our character gains a new power that allows them to transverse further into the world, pushing boundaries, coloring the environment, and watching it slowly becoming beautiful and lively. However, at the same time, it appears the world is also sending our players a message\u2026 and perhaps, unveiling to us why the world was black and white in the first place.</p><p>Headphones highly suggested for play :) </p><p>---------------------</p><p>Team Potato Lab Members:</p><p>Cindy To - Team Lead, Level &amp; Gameplay Designer, Environment Artist</p><p>Aaron Villapando - Audio Designer (Soundtrack &amp; SFX), Gameplay Programmer, VFX</p><p>Katie Park - Gameplay Programmer, Camera/Cutscene Work</p><p>Ronald 'Cen' Yam - Animator, Character Designer</p><p>Steven Dao - Technical Artist, Programmer, Character Designer </p><p>You can learn more about the game and the devs at colorlessgame.wordpress.com !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f60f3f8f36967b83b25bcabeaba9e861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["potatolab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
