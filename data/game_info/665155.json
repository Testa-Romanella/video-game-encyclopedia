Each monster attacks or uses their ability when their respect charge meters fill, so you will need to choose the best formation at the start of the battle to tackle what unique challenges the enemies present each time.\u00a0You move a monster in battle but theres a cooldown on this, so time it wisely to protect someone weak or concentrate damage on a big threat!\u00a0 \u00a0When a monster reaches 0 hp it will be unable to fight for the rest of that battle and\u00a0your party will accrue a wound.\u00a0 Gain too many wounds and your monsters will be unable to continue their quest.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>As you complete battles and events you will find food, treasure and potions, feeding monsters permanently increases their stats, and each monster can wield 1 equipment.\u00a0 These items can have very powerful effects when used on the right monster but these items can only be used before battle begins.\u00a0 Potions are one exception, these provide temporary boosts to a specific monster and can be used at any time.</p>\n<p>Throughout your journey you will come across Monster Nests and Aurite Crystals, both of which will greatly affect your party.\u00a0 Nests will provide you with an egg that can be hatched into new monster for your team.\u00a0 Aurite on the other hand is crystalized magic that will cause a monster to evolve into their next form, granting a new ability and increasing their stats.\u00a0 Every monster can evolve twice, but it will take more than just regular aurite to do so the second time.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming /Design /\u00a0Art Me\u00a0https://twitter.com/JaysGames\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional Items &amp; Parrot &amp; Dragon\u00a0Monster Families done by\u00a0https://twitter.com/ChrisMillerArt\r\n</p>\n<p>Fonts by\u00a0https://somepx.itch.io/\u00a0/\u00a0https://twitter.com/somepx\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T04:56:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f93/f932d0a8de7aeb3fc6d647fb6b31fa41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jay"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
