Well now you can! <br/><br/>Fly Dangerous is a game where 60Gs of acceleration is just fine because who needs realism? Configure your flight stick (or mouse, keyboard, gamepad or ... steering wheel, no judgements here but good luck) and take to the skies at absurd speeds. <br/><br/>Test your skill on the leaderboards with drift, careful boost control and 6dof flight model! Use flight assists to keep your balance and work towards turning them off for the best times!<br/><br/>Put some music on and chill in the infinite free roam modes.<br/><br/>Party up with friends in the various online multiplayer modes!<br/><br/>Jump into VR for the full stomach-wrenching experience!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T06:45:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/742/742c643fc96492d4e90f97d3debf26dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Juki", "Stargoat Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stargoat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
