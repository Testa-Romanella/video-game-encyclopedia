Spells and Healing\u00a0depletes Magic and you can heal up to three hearts with a full magic meter.</p>\n<p>You can attack in every direction and if you attack downward on the enemy, you can pogo off of him like in Hollow Knight.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you can't see the Hearts or Magic Meter, trying zooming in or out on the browser. I'm not experienced with WebGL and it wouldn't let me automatically detect the size.\r\n</p>\n<p>If your browser is stuck loading, refresh the page and the progress bar should move again.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a small sample to test my ability at code and playtesting. In the future as the description says I plan to have 100+ enemies in a full overworld along with 40 bosses. I hopefully improved some animations and pogo mechanics as well.</p>\n<p>Hopefully I'll have a short 1-minute trailer and Kickstarter up by July, displaying a good portion of the game without playtesting -- free\u00a0beta is still projected by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>This game was coded in C# using what I\u00a0learned off of Youtube and Udemy, while the spritesheets were made in ToonBoom and Krita. I only have experience in 2D graphics right now.\r\n</p>\n<p>Expect many more combat options as game development progresses, like more ranged/AOE attacks, dashing, wall-jump, and double jump -- basically the whole Hollow Knight schtick :D\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:28:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/259/25980d0a91deb5fb05e1a7e1e2e670e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CaptainAfrica"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
