The food from the ground can no longer be eaten. The water from the river can no longer be drunk. The air can no longer be breathed. Whether humanity can no longer support the world we live in or the world can no longer support humanity is up for debate, but the fact is if humanity wants to survive, some thing must change.</p>\n<p>The last-ditch effort of the ones left is in one machine, storing all of our history and simulating scenes from the past in near perfect accuracy. You must explore the past, aiming towards the beginning of human history as a whole to find a way to continue our existence.</p>\n<p>Along the way, there will be pieces of the past, either artefacts of cultural significance or simply pieces of what used to be a common part of daily life. By reading them, you will understand how people of past thought and behaved, learning better to navigate and understand their spaces.</p>\n<p>However, time is limited. Maybe it is your best bet to forgo time-consuming discoveries, instead choosing to push forward blindly towards the beginning, leaving chance to chance and fate to fate.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>WASD: Movement<br/>Mouse or Arrow Keys: Look around<br/>R: Restart Level<br/>Enter/Space: Skip Dialog Scroll<br/>Esc: Pause Game</p>\n<p>(Open Options To Change Looking Input)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T15:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67f/67fa1d1428636602aef6f22806548a69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bradley Jones", "Three Raccoons", "Phil the Kid", "RyanHefford", "Hk2014"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
