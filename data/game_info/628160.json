Welcome to\u00a0Grooverland.</strong></p>\n<p>Grooverland is a large parser game that takes over two hours to complete.

The hints will give explicit solutions if you get stuck or if the puzzle seems unfair.</p>\n<p>This game is written by Mathbrush (Brian Rushton).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:45:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d4496c3b6c7cb44e9a70c5cb9e9c74f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mathbrush"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
