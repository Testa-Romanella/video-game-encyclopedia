Join Detective Buckshot \"Bucky\" Jones on his first adventure as he meanders through his miserable life.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Patch 1.1 - Skip Cutscene Issue</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed a loss of control that happens when you skip the flashback cutscene</li></ul><p><strong>Patch 1 - Tweaks and Polish</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Tweaked some of the cutscenes to be less 'weird'</li><li>Added a very minimalistic HUD. There are 2 little buttons in the top left corner now</li><li>Stuck wallpaper on some of the interior walls</li><li>Added item descriptions in the inventory when you hover over an item</li><li>Added credits to the end screen</li></ul>\n<p>We didn't have time to put up the HUD. Sorry.\u00a0Press TAB to open the inventory. It's also missing the end cutscene, so the story is going to be extremely confusing<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>\u00a0you need to have an item equipped to use it. Open the inventory with TAB, and drag the item you need to the hand/sleeve position</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music by astrofreq on Pixabay</p>\n<p>Rain sound effect by\u00a0FlatHill on FreeSound.org</p>\n<p>Barking Dog sound effect by apolloaiello on FreeSound.org</p>\n<p>Rifle sound effect by Rob Marion on FreeSound.org</p>\n<p>Punch sound effect by\u00a0deleted_user_7146007 on FreeSound.org</p>\n<p>Programming by bixarrio (that's me)</p>\n<p>3D models by ANRQAngel on itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:46:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de1/de1fb17bc5a8fdf2bda462e33dd68358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bixarrio", "ANRQAngel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
