{"id": 537393, "slug": "arena-of-illusions", "name": "Arena of Illusions", "name_original": "Arena of Illusions", "description": "<p>Arena of Illusions is a Turn-based RPG which it's combat mechanics are based on the classic Legend of Legaia from the PSX. You input different commands to build a combo and, if the combination is correct, a special skill is activated. This is the basis for the combat, but there is so much more such as Stances, Skill Effects, Counters, etc.</p>\n<p>In the current build, I opted to remove the Special option and will redesign it to better fit the game (if the project continues). Before, it was a simple magic menu with a few attacks that had conditions and special effects. I got a lot of ideas on how to improve it, but I really, really would like to hear feedback and suggestions from those that played it this prototype.<br/></p>\n<p>There's a bit of dialogue between fights whether you win or lose. The dialogue is available in English and Japanese (though the later one might have more than a few grammatical errors).</p>\n<p>This is a prototype that was made, primarily, to learn UE4. The prototype is playable with keyboard and mouse and I really, really would like for you to play it and provide some feedback either here or by the Questionnaire (link inside the game). It's short, it's rough in a lot of ways, but I believe that it's a foundation of something that could become special. If it's possible, I would like to make it into a full game and properly expand the concepts shown in it. <br/></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>- 48 Unique Skills. (Good luck trying to find them all).</p>\n<p>- 9 Challenges</p>\n<p>- 12 Unique Stances<br/></p>\n<p>- Ninjas Everywhere</p>\n<p>Currently, there's a bug I could not pinpoint that occurs when you finish the game and try to make a New Game. The dialogue window does not show correctly. In that case, just relaunch the game and it should be fine. The cooked build seems a little bit less stable than the dev build I was testing, so if any bugs happen close the app and try again. Not sure why those weird bugs happened at first, but I couldn't properly replicate later them afterwards. <br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the short time you spend with it and for those that do give it a chance...</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Arena of Illusions !</p>\n<p>=============================================================================</p>\n<p><strong>Bugs found and temporary measures:</strong></p>\n<p>Do not click with the mouse again after new game or the text won't proceed the text correctly. Seems to only affect the new game. (Fixed in 1.001. Mouse does not disappear and you can click the dialog box so that the keyboard functions again).<br/></p>\n<p>=============================================================================</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T04:15:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79be32c8d6dc72b7ec3c4f873b6a2dd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lugmac"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
