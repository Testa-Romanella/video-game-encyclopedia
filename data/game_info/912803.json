You can pass through the flashing squares, but the whole floor is starting to turn solid, and each floor is turning a different colour.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WASD to move / mouse to look.</strong></p>\n<p>Made as part of the Winter Jam 2022 by SoloDevelopment. First Game Jam ever entered and pretty pleased with how this has turned out. Will be working on it more to fiinish things like the scoring system, menus, animations, iron out the controls, and then turn it into a bigger game. I had more features like different colour schemes, but ran out of time. It's pretty basic, but I learned a lot during the process.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've tagged it as 'Survival' because that's the only one that made sense. Survive the fall for as long as you can, you just can't chop any trees down and build a yurt. \ud83d\ude05</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T16:05:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b2/3b223dac9c4abc4fa6b7048ecd7614f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Omnificent"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
