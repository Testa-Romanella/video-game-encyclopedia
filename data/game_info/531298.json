{"id": 531298, "slug": "egg-rush", "name": "Egg Rush", "name_original": "Egg Rush", "description": "<p>This is intended as a short demo of a movement system and object interaction system that I developed. The movement system involves the player holding a button down on their controller and leaning their head in the direction the would like to go. Please take your time to adjust to this system, as it may be jarring at first.</p>\n<p>The object interaction system enables players to grab multiple objects. Think of grabbing a handful of candy. The amount of objects the player can grab is determined by how quickly they grip their controller. The slower you grip, the more objects you can grab.</p>\n<p>Learn these mechanics and try to get as many eggs into the basket as you can in the 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Thank you and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Built For: Oculus Quest/Quest 2/Rift/S, HTC Vive, Valve Index</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/sunny</p>\n<p>Obstacles - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/obstacle-course-pack-17816...</p>\n<p>Egg model -\u00a0https://free3d.com/3d-model/egg-370117.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T05:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aea/aeaddad4979d8df15a79a8953fd6a2bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jeshua Johnson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
