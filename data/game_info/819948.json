She named me after her dad.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>I was her favorite imaginary friend, born out of her happiest memories: the family game nights where he taught her how to play cards.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Then one night, he made the wrong bet, at the wrong craps table, in the wrong part of town. He lost everything, including her; she moved out with her mom last month. It broke her heart, and of course she wanted to know why. Someone told her about \"the gambling bug,\" and she started imagining evil dice creatures, scurrying around and biting into people. So now they're here too, in her old room.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Dad Jack is downstairs all day, trying to drown his debts in whisky. And I'm up here, the last echo of a little girl's innocence, facing the vices that crushed it.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>I like to think, if I swat enough of them, it'll send her dad some kind of psychic jolt and bring him back to his senses. Or maybe that's wishful thinking, and we're all just battling over an empty room until the repo men show up.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Either way, here they come.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T21:28:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76e/76e6463916549a5f45180c1eb5b23f40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["TriPaw Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
