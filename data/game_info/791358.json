{"id": 791358, "slug": "overdrift", "name": "Overdrift", "name_original": "Overdrift", "description": "<p>A combat racing tower offence game where you drive your goblin war machine buggy around a fantasy world trying to take down the human's castle by firing your machine gun and rockets at it. Run over knights to refill your health and ammo, drift to refill your boost-meter and blow up defensive towers to keep their defenses\u00a0down.<br/></p>\n<p>If the castle reaches the portal in the sky, you will lose, so make sure to destroy the magic shield generators to have the castle crash back down which will also deal a bit of damage to it. You will also lose if your car takes too much damage. You win the game by depleting the castle's hit points to zero.\r\n</p>\n<p>All music by Gadjos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>W\u00a0-\u00a0Accelerate\r\n</p>\n<p>S\u00a0-\u00a0Decelerate\r\n</p>\n<p>A\u00a0-\u00a0Turn Left\r\n</p>\n<p>D\u00a0-\u00a0Turn Right\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Shift -\u00a0\t\tBoost\r\n</p>\n<p>Space Bar -\u00a0Drift\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button -\u00a0Fire Machine Gun\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button - Fire Rocket\r\n</p>\n<p>Mouse Wheel\u00a0-\u00a0Rocket Selection\r\n</p>\n<p>1\u00a0-\u00a0Rocket 1\r\n</p>\n<p>2\u00a0-\u00a0Rocket 2\r\n</p>\n<p>3\u00a0-\u00a0Rocket 3\r\n</p>\n<p>4\u00a0-\u00a0Rocket 4\r\n</p>\n<p>Q\u00a0-\u00a0Roll Left\r\n</p>\n<p>E\u00a0-\u00a0Roll Right\r\n</p>\n<p>R\u00a0-\u00a0Flip Car</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T16:37:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebf/ebf15b83b96d481b32f1e219a3edd3c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yrgo_Game_Creator"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
