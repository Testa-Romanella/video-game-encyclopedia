However my focus lies on game art and had to dip into tech art, level, UI and game design and scripting to fulfill this project.</p>\n<p>HUGE thanks to Marc Davis for the music and sounds!!</p>\n<p>Software used:<br/>Modelling: Blender<br/>Sculpting: ZBrush<br/>UV Unwrap: 3Ds Max<br/>Rigging &amp; Character Animations: Maya<br/>Baking: Marmoset Toolbag 4<br/>Texturing: Substance Painter<br/>Engine: Unity<br/>Logo, UI &amp; Graphics Edit: Photoshop<br/>Video Edit: DaVinci Resolve<br/><br/>((Also first time creating a trailer!! was so exciting to finally try that!!))<br/><br/>Find me on:<br/></p><p>ArtStation: https://www.artstation.com/alinaquitschalle<br/>Twitter: https://twitter.com/MizziDerStein\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T10:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d685b13b7377d9eddfa8c5301804866f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Missi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
