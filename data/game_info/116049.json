Just move a square in the same direction and you'll reappear.</li><li>You may feel lost. \u00a0If so, talk to the characters again.</li><li>If you cannot exit the room with the knife, go talk to it again.</li><li>If you get stuck when the salt falls, go over the gray part (the yellow is sprites and you can't walk over sprites).</li><li>The exits do not span the whole width of the wall. They are two or three tiles in the center of each wall (so if you go right to enter another room, approach the middle tiles of the right wall).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd3/cd3bed97815cc7c0655250f83e44ab12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stoatworks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
