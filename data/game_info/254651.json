Their goal is to take control of the house. <br/>Play with them to turn your everyday environment into a gigantic playground. Challenge your friends in a series of messed-up mini-games and use the sandbox mode to create your very own game sessions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>A Real Party Game</strong><br/><br/>Skelittle: A Giant Party is an authentic party game. It is designed to bring people together through a great couch gaming experience. 2 to 4 players can challenge themselves locally, collaborate or get creative together with gamepads or directly on a keyboard. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Instant Fun on wicked minigames</strong><br/><br/>There are 15 minigames in the current version of Skelittle: A Giant Party. We will be adding new content on a regular basis during the early access phase to reach 20 minigames or more in the full release version. <br/>All minigames take place in your everyday environment put in a new light! Run from the vacuum robot, shoot at mosquitos, steal kibbles from the dog or push your friend in the printer machine. And don\u2019t forget to keep up with the funk! Enjoy the game\u2019s original soundtrack: a groovy mix of funk, rock &amp; fusion! <br/>All minigames are designed to provide instant fun to groups of friends or family! You can get competitive and improve your skills at each session or be a good team member and collaborate\u2026until you are ready to turn your back on everyone\u2026again \ud83d\ude0a!<br/><br/><br/><strong>A Sandbox mode </strong><br/><br/>Get creative together!! Skelittle: A Giant Party includes a sandbox mode so you and your friends can design together your very own game sessions. <br/>Use the sandbox mode to personalize the Skelittle\u2019s lair (an old tire truck abandoned somewhere in the family garage\u2026). The more you play the game, the more you unlock new objects to be used in this mode. <br/>For example, imagine building your very own soccer game with 4 soccer cages, a maze in the middle and a boxing glove for each player\u2026 You get the idea: in the Stach mode, you can combine a variety of objects to create one-of-a-kind game sessions and customize your friendzones with your tribe! Pretty fun right?  <br/><br/><strong>JOIN THE TEAM !!</strong><br/><br/>We are gamers! Our development team loves playing, making and discovering new video games, especially indie games. <br/>So, our goal here is to make a real and successful early access. That means 3 things: <br/> 1. Provide a real game from the start: while we will add new content in the next months, the early access version is a real video game, already fun and well-polished<br/> 2. Include the game community: we would like to include as much as possible the gamer community in this phase of the development process. So, join our discord <br/>     server to brainstorm with us on new minigames idea, the design of new objects for the sandbox mode or just to say hello! <br/> 3. Publish regularly: our goal is to include new content every two week with a major update every month. So, play regularly, you will see some amazing changes during <br/>     the early access phase! <br/>So get on board! Get your friends! and have fun with the funkiest party game ever!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40b/40bdd0f837545439fa7e77bcd438deb1.jpg", "website": "http://skelittle.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bubble Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bubble Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
