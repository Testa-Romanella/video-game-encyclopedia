I will be doing quality-of-life updates as I learn more about Unity and C#, but the game as-is (ver. 1.0) is considered feature complete.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef040c8cbe2d08a5d4a7ef4cace5d75d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wesley Gardner"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
