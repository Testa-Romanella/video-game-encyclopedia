I am very proud of what I have made with the little time and skill I had to work with. Feedback is always welcome since there is a lot more I wish to add to it and update it.</p><p>As this project has been made for a Gam Jam, It had a few rules to follow. The main theme - Memories, and a restriction - the game must start and end as different genres. I did my best to make something that fits those ideas, and I think that in some way I managed.</p><p>The idea I ended up with: Our hero (a cube) has forgotten what is truly important for it. It goes around, collecting blank memories of things it created by viewing the world from a dark side. There is only one thing it can do to escape the fake memories. To find a real one. Even better, to find its brightest memory and face the darkness by itself. <br/></p><p>Special thanks to my friend Snow for their amazing animations.<br/></p><p>Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T02:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14d8f9b4483ab38cddcdf19696f5581f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PanBan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
