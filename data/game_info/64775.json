{"id": 64775, "slug": "pi-is-everything", "name": "Pi is Everything", "name_original": "Pi is Everything", "description": "Make circles! While the world spins round and round all you have to do is just press the space bar when the spinning bar is at the right place to make a circle. At first it\u2019s easy, the bar oscillates with a period of pi seconds (3.14 s^-1), giving you plenty of time to make your first circle. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut it won\u2019t be easy for long! The difficulty increases every pi seconds: The speed of the bar increases by 3.14% (pi %) each time, until it reaches a frequency of 3.14 Hz (pi Hz). Once it reaches that frequency, the speed of the bar decreases again, until it reaches a period of pi seconds (3.14 s^-1).<br/>\r\nIt sounds complicated doesn\u2019t it? If you try it out you\u2019ll see it\u2019s more addictive than complicated.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow many circles can you make? Maybe just 3.14? 31.41? 314.15? 3141.5? <br/>\r\nHow long can you play for? 3.14 seconds? 3.14 minutes (00:03:08.4)? 3.14 hours (03:08:24)? 3.14 days (75:21:36)? Weeks? Months? Years? Decades? I hope you\u2019ll be around for at least a while.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat about the music? Oh, the music is great. The tempo is 3.14Hz (188.4 bpm)! No radius has better music. You can obviously turn the game\u2019s music off if you like, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Ohh, and the sound effects. Get ready to hear an awesome robotic \u201cpi\u201d every time you hit the space bar!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere\u2019s simply no way around it, this game is rotund. If only there was a way we could get the game\u2019s rating to be exactly 3.14 stars out of 5. Now that would make it full circle. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOk, I think that\u2019s enough circle puns.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPS: Do you know how many words this description has? I\u2019ll give you a minute or 3.14 minutes to figure it out while I\u2019m out and around.<br/>\r\nPPS: Did you get it? 314 words.
