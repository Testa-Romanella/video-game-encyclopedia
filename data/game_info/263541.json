As you enter the complex conflict, you forge a new path that will change the course of history!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n...maybe. The thing is, acting like most heroes gets you killed, and most evil overlords' plans make no sense. The Last Sovereign is a game that twists your expectations for adult games, while fully embracing a reconstruction of some familiar old tropes to provide a lot of fun, sexy content. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBy telling a story that has sex as an integral component, The Last Sovereign offers a deep storyline that naturally includes sex scenes. No need to grind for hours or lose to every enemy to find the content. Not only will you adventure in a world where sex is a weapon, you'll build a harem of fully-realized characters with their own reasons for being with you... in and out of the bedroom. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHours of Gameplay: 50+<br/>\r\nText Scenes: 150+", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T02:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/705/705c39e29a9b6e8c2881bc3d08ea8a56.jpg", "website": "https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 125, "toplay": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sierra Lee"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sierra Lee"], "esrb_rating": null}
