As well as this, the game has a cover mechanic to allow the player to hide behind cover while shooting at enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game itself is based off the \"Containment\" GDD that I created in 2021 as a part of a university assessment. Although, when comparing the GDD and the finished prototype, a lot has been changed and adapted, simply due to the scope of the game and in general gaining better ideas.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy the game :) It will most likely not be updated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also have a gameplay video up on YouTube, so feel free to watch it instead of playing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>JD\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T16:47:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14e28066184ea3dd8dfb89ca551baa11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NotJoshuaa"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
