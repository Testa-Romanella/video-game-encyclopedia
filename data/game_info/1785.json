Luckily this firefly has a special ability to turn lights off and on, and Penumbear has his own unique ability to walk on the lines where shadow and light meet!<br/><br/>PENUMBEAR is a classic platformer with an emphasis on danger, exploration and puzzle solving. Each of the game\u2019s 100 levels combine lights and blocks to create drastically different layouts for Penumbear to explore as he tries to find his way out of the dark castle.<br/><br/>He\u2019ll explore the castle\u2019s basement with it\u2019s shadowy creatures and tentacles, before traveling to the grimy and spiky dungeon, the vast cavern, up the fireplace and through the tower to reach his freedom. Along the way he\u2019ll encounter increasingly vicious monsters, fiendish puzzles, and gigantic bosses determined to stop his progress.<br/><br/>Hundreds of fellow bears are hidden through the castle and it\u2019s up to Penumbear to save them all. Secrets are in every corner; secret levels, warp zones, special achievement bears and especially elusive Golden bears. Taking the time to fully explore the castle\u2019s many levels will prove rewarding! <br/><br/>Penumbear is an immersive experience that recalls the best of classic platformers while presenting something new and exciting for the genre. <br/><br/>FEATURES: <br/><br/>-Walk on lights and shadows<br/>-Over 100 levels to explore<br/>-Tons of secret to discover (Levels, bonus bear, new characters ...)<br/>-An entire castle with many trap to face of<br/>-Fight giant bosses during your trip<br/>-Game Center Achievements<br/>-Universal version<br/><br/>We hope that you enjoy Penumbear.<br/><br/>Do not hesitate to give us your feedback or to recommand the game to your friends. <br/><br/>Thank you,\u00a0Team Taco Graveyard and Bulkypix.<br/><br/>CURIOUS?
