It can be completed in 5 - 30 minutes (depending on how good you are at puzzles).</p>\n<p>If enough people like the concept, I'll happily add more levels and features.\u00a0(such as different types of students with unique behaviours, like taking turns twice as fast, or 'dunce' students that have to sit in a specific desk, just to mix up the possibilities a little bit)</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdb99225e286bd1fa1b54f15e1334a7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Vox Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
