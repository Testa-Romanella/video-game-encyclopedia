That part of the concept seems simple enough, right? There is one thing to keep in mind though, the car has a manual transmission. So not only do you have to drive through 20 courses with obstacles but you also have to try your best to not stall the car or grind the gears.</p><p>Want to try the game before thinking about getting the full version? There is a demo of the game you can try.<br/></p><p>Note: This game is not a realistic simulation of the manual transmission. Hopefully the pics made that obvious but just to make sure.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65dad48b4aecdcc828f92888e2ef90fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CamoDragon042"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
