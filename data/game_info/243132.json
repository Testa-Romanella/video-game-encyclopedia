In this game, you slide until you hit a wall or land on a puck. If you land on a puck, that puck will be moved forward the same distance you traveled. Pucks can fly over walls or other\u00a0pucks, as long as they land in an open space, but you can't knock one on top of another puck or out of bounds. The goal is to get a puck on every target.<br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard controls: arrow keys or WASD to move; [X] to toggle movement guides (maybe useful for larger levels);\u00a0[Z] to undo moves; [R] to reset</p>\n<p>Touchscreen controls: tap at the main menu; swipe to move; tap during the game to toggle movement guides (maybe useful for larger levels);\u00a0open the tab menu in the upper left to undo moves and reset</p>\n<p>Hackable version:\u00a0https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=033fbf6b1d605e6efaeb633e15601391</p>\n<p>Original game credits:</p>\n<ul><li>concept - \u00a9 2005 mathgrant of www.greylabyrinth.com</li><li>mazes - \u00a9 2005 mathgrant, fadeblue, zag &amp; lostdummy of www.greylabyrinth.com, and Andrea Gilbert.</li><li>javascript - \u00a9 2005 ralphmerridew of www.greylabyrinth.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/050/050652affdbf8ad0d9643de95c3dcea5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CHz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
