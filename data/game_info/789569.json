I found my Firefox was messing up. But Edge and Chrome worked perfectly. </strong><br/></p>\n<p>You play as a Frog, you must hop to find a Mate. There is only so much time that Frog Bae feels like getting Froggy. So make haste. Every motion counts. The timer only ticks, when you move.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0There is only THREE LEVELS. The final level you get to spend what little time you have left next to the cute Frog Bae. So enjoy that. Then alt+f4. lol.<br/></p>\n<p>This was made in Corgi Engine(for unity) I've been wanting to learn the Package a lot so this game jam helped a ton with that.<br/></p>\n<p>A few issues still. Mostly with audio. So if you have issues with ODDio then just mute it in mixer. I worked to the last minute with this. I learned a lot from this. Messed up on some things during level transition. But it's playable and Im happy as a Frog on a log.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T22:53:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a53/a53cba156bd777a83ac2dc7451d8b4d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jago1996"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
