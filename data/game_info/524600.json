You have to take orders from customers and complete them while they are coming towards you.</p><p>Have you ever dreamed of becoming a candy seller? This is the opportunity to test your skills in it.

You definitely don't want a hungry and angry customer.</p><p>To pick up the right food just move towards the container on any side and touch it. However, watch out for the rest of the food because it will come rushing back at you\u00a0right after\u00a0 you picked one up.</p>Controls:<p>- Press arrow keys to move left and right (or you can use A and D)</p><p>- Press space to shoot</p>Yes, it is that simple!The story of this game<p>Originally, this game was made for a small three-day game jam but unfortunately due to the hectic schedule hadn't been\u00a0finished in time for the deadline.
