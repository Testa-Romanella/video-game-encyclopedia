You will carefully\u00a0 have to learn how to\u00a0take advantage of the gravity forces from planets and other objects to guide your rocket. Rescue all stranded astronauts to complete each level.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Use Up and Down arrow keys to control the rocket. You can zoom out with the space bar and use R to reset the level.</p>\n<p>The game is fully functional, but it only has a few level as a proof of concept. I\u00a0might expand it in the future, adding more levels and more gameplay features.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T10:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/264/264b915fb7b45327ab10f5f0f256bbf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["diegonher"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
