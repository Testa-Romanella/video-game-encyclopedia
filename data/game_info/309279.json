The detective.\u00a0 As of right now this game is a demo/Pre-Pre Alpha ;) so there isn't very much to say about the game itself other than it has 3 places. Violl's Garden, Roselake and Dialite's Rest. The Dialites are an enemy species coming to the Alpha of the game. The demo is very short though. I would recommend to explore the maps.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T02:53:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da8/da877213064b46b178b3be8e57a129f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrypticDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
