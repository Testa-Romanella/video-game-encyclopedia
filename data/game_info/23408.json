Using either a keyboard/mouse or a gamepad, you'll traverse through the mothership fighting not only enemies, but yourself.<br/><br/>Take control of Spike (or Sotira, if that's your taste) to fight against the aliens and space robots threatening humanity.<br/>Every bullet you fire will ricochet off walls. The more you shoot, the deeper you descend into the depths of <strong>bullet hell</strong>. While keeping your shooting to a minimum, you'll have to dodge enemy bullets that are equally dangerous (and bouncy).<br/>You're not alone, though! Through a mysterious transmission, you can buy upgrades for your ship using chips acquired from enemies you defeat.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Wide Variety Of Different Enemy Types<br/></li><li>Over 35 levels<br/></li><li>Full Xbox controller support<br/></li><li>Multiple boss (and mini-boss) battles<br/></li><li>Several ship upgrades to buy and equip<br/></li><li>Use explosives and charge shots to blast through tougher opponents<br/></li><li>Activate bullet-time to get out of sticky situations</li></ul><br/>Just Don't Shoot Yourself.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T09:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cc/6cc9f3450c4e33cb7b772a56b71c24b7.jpg", "website": "https://chimruoigames.itch.io/backfire", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Chim Ruoi Games", "Joel Rochon", "Eathams"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chim Ruoi Games", "Joel Rochon", "Eathams"], "esrb_rating": null}
