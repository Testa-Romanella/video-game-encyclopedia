{"id": 100259, "slug": "dynasty-feud-demo", "name": "Dynasty Feud Demo", "name_original": "Dynasty Feud Demo", "description": "<p>Warning, this is a Demo with local mode only!!!</p>\n<p><strong>Dynasty Feud\u00a0</strong>is a competitive, team-based, fast-paced platform brawler for 2-4 players. Play either local or online and show off your skills with 40 characters, one-hit kills, multiple fighting skills and a lot of style.</p>\n<p>OK, but... what does that mean? Well, <strong>Dynasty Feud</strong> is different from other brawlers out there, taking inspiration from several genres to offer an experience that is faster, leaner and a lot of fun!</p>\n\n<ul><li>Beat other dynasties in the ultimate battle between time periods in free-for-all and team matches.</li><li>Customize your own dynasty in the ALL-STAR MODE.</li><li>Challenge other players in quick ONLINE matches or rise to the top in RANKED MODE.<em> (Not available in Demo)</em></li><li>Master all 40 CHARACTERS of the 8 DYNASTIES currently available!\u00a0<em>(2 Dynasties, 10 character in Demo)</em></li></ul>\n\n<p>In <strong>Dynasty Feud </strong>you won\u2019t pick a character to fight, you will pick a whole dynasty formed by 5 of them. The characters are your life bar, if you lose all of them, that\u2019s it, you are done. What, really? No way! And they die fast, really fast, REALLY REALLY FAST; one hit and that character is gone. Yeah, gone. The next character will appear, but it will be a totally different one, with its own weaknesses and strengths.<br/></p>\n<p>Value your characters and measure your movements carefully. Knowing their capacities<br/>and how to use them is as important as knowing your enemies. Plus there are 40 like this, so... have fun. A miscalculated jump, a surprise burst or missed attack can be the difference between death and glory. Uuuhh, that sounded serious.<br/><br/>Each character is unique. Each character plays differently. Each dynasty is special.</p>\n<p>From melee juggernauts to sneaky snipers, along with invisible ninjas and a TNT-loving cactus, a true Dynasty Master can adapt to any opponent by making the most of each of its family members. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/164/1642c2f6853edf77f8c865a1bb0da04a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaia_studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
