Every year, the geese migrate through and cause a whole mess of things, but then they leave. This time, Mouse Central Intelligence learned that the geese plan to migrate in for KEEPS. So it's up to special agents <strong>Minx </strong>and <strong>Fufu </strong>to infiltrate the geese's industrial complex, capture the executive migration orders, and swap them out for the dummy ones that will send them to Antarctica instead.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Left and Right arrows to move, Z to swap between the mice and X to use their action.</p>\n<p>Minx is brown and is a toughie. She can lift anything her size, and can knock out a goose in one punch! X to pick up a box she's next to, or to knock out a goose from behind!</p>\n<p>Fufu is gray and is nimble, can roll and crawl through small spaces. Use X to roll into the vents or behind a turning goose!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2a/e2a6d78d4d28a12d3cc4a3d09bac1c6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Bright Moth Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
