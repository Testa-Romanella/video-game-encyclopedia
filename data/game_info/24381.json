You guide them through rooms filled with various elements of \n      danger, from enemies to rolling boulders. Your main power is to rotate \n      the rooms 90\u00b0 to the left or to the right. Mastering the law of gravity \n      is therefore essential for your success. Everything and everyone in the \n      room is subjected to gravity and falls when you turn the room. Watch \n      your head! Since there are three worlds with nine levels of about 10 \n      rooms each, that's a whole lot of fun and brain twisting that awaits you \n      on your Nintendo DSi system.
