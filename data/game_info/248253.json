As of right now (in development) there are a total 20+ levels with some unique adventure/ game mechanic elements scattered throughout the game (that I thought would be amazing to have!).\u00a0The <strong>rage </strong>elements of the game are designed to not be considered a <em>\"Break your keyboard\"</em> level of rage but rather a <em>\"Mild inconvenience\"</em> level of rage.\u00a0I wanted to add a feeling of <strong>horror\u00a0</strong>through visual and audio representations since the game is based in a space-like environment and as we know, space can be very frighting packed with many unknowns.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>FUTURE:</em></strong></p>\n<p>I have set up some visual representations\u00a0of a story that I would like to tell \u00a0(using the breakable blocks)\u00a0and have also thought of some extra/ returning mechanics that I would like to add to the game but that is entirely based on your opinion. Yes <strong><em>y</em></strong><em><strong>our opinion means a lot to me </strong></em>and I would like to make whatever I create better then ever so please tell me in the comments what you think about this game. From the bottom of my heart I thank you for giving it your time and I sincerely hope you guys enjoy what I create, now and in the future!</p>\n\n<p>Don't forget to smile :)</p>\n\n\n<p>Special thanks to\u00a0freesound.org, bensound.com\u00a0and Youtuber Annex for providing the music and sound effects!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/638/638ab7de0f86011cbdfb6d47b73cc5ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["demon202"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
