We are sorry that currently, the game seems bugged as it can not trigger the end game after the last wave of enemies.</p>\n<p>Q: How can I collect \"body parts\"?</p>\n<p>A: There are two ways: 1. Defeating enemies - You will be auto-collecting them when you walk near the drops. 2. Hex Ritual - There is a ritual site that will spawn one \"body part\" per 10 seconds.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T10:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e3125e464630d9880cbfa089c9cd7749.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fhy", "1kmountains", "chunholum", "BoreasTheEdgelord"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
