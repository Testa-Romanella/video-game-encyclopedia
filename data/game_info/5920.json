The end goal is simple enough, the player who has the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins! Players acquire Victory Points by employing a variety of maid cards that allow for different strategies when played together. You can even employ more interesting, unique maids that stick around to use their special powers each per turn! But beware, your opponents can make your maids sick or give them bad habits, affecting your maids in negative ways and decreasing your Victory Points! Do you have what it takes to run the best Mansion?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T03:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff1e922ad8252f31c51e50d1b5029d76.jpeg", "website": "https://japanimegames.com/collections/tanto-cuore", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Playdek", "Japanime Digital", "Wedontknow Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Card", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Playdek", "Japanime Games", "Arclight"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
