But i'am also someones who likes to play adult games. so since i'am slightly good at drawing i thought why not do both. Thus randel tales was born.<br/>But please remember this game is entirely made by a single person,Me! so dont expect\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Summer time saga level stuff. But if the game gets enough support i might hire more artists.<br/>Randel tales is not your average adult game where your primary goal is banging all the girls. I tried to make a good plot to this game. But for the guys who just want to bang and dont care about the plot dont worry, Randel tales will have a lot of Characters and a lot of h-scenes as well.<br/><br/>Story<br/>The story takes place in Merdian. A magical land with elves, dwarves, goblins and many other creatures but merdian has been under attack by the devil kings army for centuries. You are a young boy who was taken in by a merchant and brought to randel, a small town.You have no memories of your past. You then go out to train as a soldier and also join the towns adventures guild. You meet a lot of beautiful girls along the way and you get to \"romance\" them (*cough* bang *cough*).\u00a0<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Randel tales is sandbox type game. Yeah since its early in development it ui needs polishing and i still didn't implement the point and click feature but all of these will be implemented in the future. The combat is not rpg style .It will be\u00a0choice based.<br/>The choices will greatly impact the game as you reach the end, some choices may lead to character deaths and you'll be unable to progress their story so be carefull.<br/>Here are some of the planned fetishes,<br/>Fantasy<br/>Medival<br/>magic<br/>corruption<br/>Romance<br/>Ahego<br/>Harem<br/>Anal<br/>sex<br/>Creampie<br/>Rape (OPTIONAL!)<br/>BDSM<br/>Lesbian<br/>masturbation<br/>And many more</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:31:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c46/c461e8213de8b49d87406bb9fd3b45d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Bunis"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
