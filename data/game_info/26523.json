If the placement \n      isn\u2019t quite right, use the UFO to grab blocks back to shoot them in \n      different spots. Adding to the challenge, puzzles often contain several \n      types of blocks and spots, each with its own characteristics, on the \n      playing grid. Journey to multiple planets to tackle puzzles individually \n      in Puzzle mode or try to clear as many puzzles as you can within the \n      time limit in frenetic Time Attack mode. In either mode, the combination \n      of strategy and action result in a classic puzzle game that definitely \n      hits the right spot!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66e90ee77e3f6a36c203a4301327db02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
