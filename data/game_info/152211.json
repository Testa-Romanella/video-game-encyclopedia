He writes his life\u00a0to tape and lets it go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, our robot is wandering through his old memories, looking for things that were lost long ago.\u00a0He can play one tape at a time, and\u00a0each tape recalls a different maze of lost thoughts. To become whole again, he must find his way through each maze and recover what he lost.</p>\n\n<p>My submission for Ludum Dare 42.
