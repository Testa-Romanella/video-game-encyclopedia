Thanks a lot!</p>\n<p>This game was made as realistically as I possibly can, so you can't expect that much music. I mean, you don't have any background music playing while you walk, right?</p>\n<p>I thought so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The battles also don't have any music. Just sound effects.</p>\n<p>That's pretty much it!</p>\n<p>Have fun playing the game!<br/></p>\n<p>The downloads include a drawing of an Astral Cupcake and a picture of a young Golden Retriever.*</p><p>*I hid the pictures for until the voting period to avoid people from downloading something else than the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a4/1a48b09626d82e4ed192e1069c97dd83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScreenFaulty"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
