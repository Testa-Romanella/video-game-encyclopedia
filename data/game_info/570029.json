This is Project AO (temporary title.)</p>\n<p>A turn-based, dungeon crawling, mobile fantasy RPG. Project AO features a deep and complex skill system where each class has a number of skills you can equip and their effects change depending on what other skills you use with them.</p>\n<p>There will be a total of 8 classes to choose from with unique play styles, but currently only the Rogue class is available in the demo.</p>\n<p>You will unlock more skill slots as you level up, so make sure to check them out and equip them before going back into battle. You can see what skills do by clicking their icon after examining them.</p>\n<p>Enemies have a chance to drop armor and weapons in the demo, so keep a look out for those. The current gameplay loop is simply kill stuff, get stronger, kill stronger stuff. This is just a proof of concept for now. I plan to add many other features.</p>\n<p>Features such as:<br/></p>\n<p>Crafting, skill leveling system,\u00a0boss fights, equipment upgrading, merchants, respec, quests, various story and utility NPCs, and much more.</p>\n<p>All artwork is temporary, but the color palette and style should give you a general idea of what I'm going for eventually.</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave any feedback or reach out to me directly at:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/LacopaEspy<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T08:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f3/8f3805115273354e05d14f3aa6dd453c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["apocarypse"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
