Choose  your favorite junior scientist \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd2c, grab your floaty animal, and set forth  into the sea, recycling all trash you find using a very reliable  underwater trash bin \u267b\ufe0f. Recycle all the trash in a coral habitat to make  the sea anemone grow back, and you will be able to guide the clownfish  back to its home \ud83c\udfe0.\r\n</p>\n<p>The senior scientists need your help too! That's  why you've been equipped with the B.U.D.D.I. (Biometric Underwater Deep  Dive Instrument) \ud83d\udcdf. After the coral is cleaned, the B.U.D.D.I. will  gather a report and stay behind to monitor the coral's health \ud83d\udcca as you  continue in your job, which is to clean the entire coral reef. But watch  out for jellyfish! Jellyfish need a clean habitat too, but they don't  necessarily know you're here to help, and they have stingers\u00a0\u26a1 that  protect them from anything that gets in their way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MOVE:</strong> \u2190 / \u2192<br/><strong>JUMP:</strong> spacebar, \u2191, or any key<br/><strong>FALL THROUGH:</strong> \u2193</p>\n\n<p>B.U.D.D.I. was commissioned as part of an after school program for 5th grade students by education researcher Allison Bridges at Columbia University and was partially funded by National Geographic.
