But it comes with <strong>two limitations:</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>The web version does not have a leaderboard!</li><li>The web version does not save your game when I publish an update! That means you will lose all your progress when I publish an update. Therefore, I recommend downloading the mobile app and playing that one instead.</li></ol>\n<p>Finally, please\u00a0join our Discord for discussion/feedback and all the other things.
