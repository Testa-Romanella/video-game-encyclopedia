Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty. No animal in the world knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery. <strong>We need beer\u00a0:\u00a0</strong><strong>that is the plain truth.</strong>''</p>\n<p>-Major, the Old Pig</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T03:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c40877e436e15116e1046e31339e6c8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Whiskey Bar"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
