As a top-down sci-fi shooter, Gigantic X will require fast reactions and responses from its players. Your skills, gear, and knowledge will only be tested more and more as you climb the ranks.<br/><br/><br/>SETTING<br/><br/>  In the interstellar age, the human race is expanding throughout the galaxy.

They\u2019re not particularly fond of the Galactic Alliance, but cash is cash.
