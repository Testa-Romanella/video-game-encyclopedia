Charge your projectiles to make them more potent, buy items at the shop, and defeat 10 waves of enemies to complete the game.</p>\n<p>Keyboard + Mouse &amp; Controller Support! (If controller is connected, keyboard + mouse inputs get ignored, so if you want to use keyboard + mouse, unplug your controller. Sorry for the inconvenience!)</p>\n\n<p>* This is the first complete game I made with GameMaker, also not made for any jam. I'm rereleasing it because I think its kinda fun, and I did put alot of time into it. I made some slight quality-of-life changes from the original, but almost everything is identical. I may add more content to it, or remake it into a better version later since I've learned so much since then, but no promises. I also used a different alias when I first released it, and I don't plan on taking it down anymore.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T07:01:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c21cdff6f7130704286f1c76b7e0eb01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nandbolt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
