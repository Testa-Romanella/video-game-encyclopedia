Grab a friend &amp; use the on-screen control (there's only 1 button!), choose a bot, &amp; push your opponent off the edge.\u00a0<br/><br/>If you don't want to see ads, you can now pay to hide adverts, and unlock all bots and levels.\u00a0<br/><br/>Please rate &amp; comment. I'm looking for honest feedback, so if you've noticed bugs or have suggestions for more bots, please leave them as a review, or tweet me at @davidonionball.\u00a0<br/><br/>I have more plans and ideas for this game, but I'll only work on them if there's interest. So please rate! Thanks!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d62/d623a767b898d625f7c455b3868b6db8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["davidonionball"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
