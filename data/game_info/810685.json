You're welcome.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>(Not my video of course)</p>\n\n<p>If you haven't watched it, then do it. It's a great video. This is the 2nd video I've watched from Oats Jenkins and I'm already a fan. Don't forget to subscribe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway</p>\n<p>There are many additions to this new (better) version of Chess. Although most of the video was very in depth about what happens in certain situations, there were some things that had to be made up. For example, the video details that a monkey isn't limited to how many swings it can perform. This that means it can just go back and forth swinging over 1 piece, and it could get into a situation where it can't end it's turn by taking a piece like it normally would. I decided to add a simple button to end your turn if you're swinging with the monkey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>More additions to come, like a customizable timer and just a better feel of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also click the top left click to toggle the board being flipped.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If something doesn't seem to be working please let me know in the comments on this page and I'll fix it. This is my first game made purely from JavaScript so it's kind of garbage code but at least it works.\u00a0</p><p>If you have any ideas for improvements let me know.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T06:16:42", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Swiftingly"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
