The game is not finished yet</p>\n<p><strong>It was a routine visit to the hospital... But a mutant germ made it otherwise!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your friend got hospitalised (it happens), and being a good person, you decided to pay them a visit. However, upon arriving to the Sinai Hill hospital (not as good as the Mount Sinai one just by the street... bloody healthcare...), you soon came to the realisation that something's wrong.\r\n</p>\n<p>It seems like some of the hospital's patients went mad, and they want you\u00a0<em>dead</em>! Can you avoid getting mauled by the hospital's weird residents? Can you find your friend and get them out of there? Find out in:\u00a0<strong>FG's RealCast\u2122 Volume 1: Horror Hospital</strong></p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The Game</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In this first-ever realtime 3D textured game for the NES, your object is to navigate the hospital in search of your friend. Fight mad patients along the way, level up, and collect all 18\u00a0tokens for a special surprise!\r\n</p>\n<p>This all started back in August/September 2020. I had the wild idea of making a 3D raycaster for the NES (think Wolfenstein). After getting a walking simulator out on Twitter, it somehow exploded, and a big part of the retro scene wanted more.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thus, a few months later, I picked the project back up to see if it was possible to make a little game out of it! I made the framerate palatable, corrected a few issues, added a basic random battle system,\u00a0and here we are!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em>Woooooah! 3D?!?!
