I spend around three thousands hours after my normal job in six years to make it and deliver it to you. My main purpose was to make a fun strategy. Some features were inspired by games created in '90s:<br/><ul><li> Castles and armies<br/></li><li> Towers that conquers terrain<br/></li><li> Production chains</li></ul>Some features I invented myself to make this game original:<br/><ul><li> Features are uncovered by completing the stained glass window, so you will see only very small fraction of features at the beginning and even after you complete the story they may still be some main features that you don't know.<br/></li><li> Token battle (inspired by Go game)<br/></li><li> Masks that influences terraforming monsters<br/></li><li> An game engine that can speed up game even 2 thousands times depending on your PC</li></ul><h3>What is this game NOT?</h3><ul><li> A perfect product - I spend only around 300 hours on testing this game, but if you found a bug please report it in steam discussions and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.<br/></li><li> A game with w lot of animations - don't expect an AAA game. I made it for people that are looking for something original, not for players that expect only graphic from games.<br/></li><li> A game with flawless progress - this game is sometimes grindy, and you may find maps and quests repetitive.<br/></li><li> A game with low entry threshold - my retired mother was able to play this game without any help, but she is patient and intelligent. You may want to skip this title if you frustrate quickly when you don't understand something.<br/></li><li> A game with unique graphic - it contains packages of images that you might have seen.<br/></li><li> A game with unique music - it contains packages of music/sounds that you might have heard.<br/></li><li> A tower defence game or an economy game.
