In the jam's theme of \"stuck in a loop\" you will have 8 chickens \"stuck in a loop\" around you as a form of protection from milk missiles. The game progressively gets harder and harder, but don't worry if you cant beat my HiScore of 4050, you can always try to beat your own previous HiScore!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:45:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/572a17549954e8b6804bebce04aec221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FunkyFreshTy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
