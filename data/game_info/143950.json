It is a survival game in which you must sail through dark, Kraken infested waters, keeping your ship's lanterns lit and avoiding perilous rocks until daylight arrives.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This game was developed and tested for the HTC Vive. You can play the game with the Oculus Rift, but you may experience visual or positional tracking bugs. We recommend playing on an HTC Vive.<br/></p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<ul><li>Hold triggers to grab objects, release to drop.</li><li>Grab and tug on the sheet rope on the port side of the boat to control the speed of the boat.</li><li>Grab and rotate the tiller on the starboard side of the boat to control the direction of the boat.</li><li>Your boat's lanterns dim over time!
