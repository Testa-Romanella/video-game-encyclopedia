The faster you go and the more stuff you collect along the way, the more score you get at the end for a higher overall rank! Currently, 3 levels are available for the testing, so give them a try and have fun!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T19:24:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39f/39f46aaadb0de9889e00c91ad2009a63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MechaStar81"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
