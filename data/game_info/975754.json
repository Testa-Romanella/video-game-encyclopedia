The art of harnessing the comet's blessings was called alchemy, and the practitioners of this art were known as alchemists.<br/>However, when the comet disappeared and its blessings were no longer available, the use of alchemy gradually declined and was eventually forgotten.<br/><br/>Many years have passed, and in a corner of Lantarna two girls have a fateful meeting.<br/>One is Resna, who has found hope in alchemy and is on her way to the Capital, aiming to travel to the World\u2019s End where the source of the miracle is said to lie.<br/>The other is Valeria, a girl who has lost her memories and now lives in the city while doing rough work as an adventurer for the Moonlight Society.<br/><br/>Behind them looms the shadow of the group known as the Polar Night Alchemists, a dark organization shrouded in mystery.<br/>With different motives and ambitions intertwined, the two eventually come closer to the truth that lies dormant on the continent.<h3>GAME SYSTEM</h3><strong>New Adventures with a New Protagonist</strong><br/>An epic adventure with a new protagonist, the first one in four years since the release of \u201cAtelier Ryza.\u201d Embark on this adventure to revive alchemy with a cast of charming characters!<br/><br/><strong>High-Quality 3D Characters in Action</strong><br/>The latest technology developed for the Atelier series has been used to create 3D graphics equivalent to the latest console titles.
