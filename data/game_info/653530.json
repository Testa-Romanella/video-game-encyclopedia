I took the prompt \"running out of space\", in a literal direction, removing the functionality of the \"Space\" bar and jump, apart from instantly killing you when pressed.</p>\n<p>This game is about dying and learning the levels, and of course instinct control.</p>\n<p>I thought it would be a fun challenge to create a platformer without probably the most important element and make it fun. Did I succeed? You tell me.</p>\n<p>This is my first ever attempt at making any sort of game, so feedback is welcomed.</p>\n<p>The game can be completed in about 5-10 minutes, or even shorter depending on your knowledge of the levels.</p>\n<p>My fastest time was 81 seconds, try to beat it.</p>\n<p>There are 10 short levels, with a couple of hidden things.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T07:56:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7e/d7e18af3f49ecc50492d3d33a0fa7ca4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aidantwiford"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
