Splat \n      doesn\u2019t really like being locked in a cage and wants to do his own \n      thing, so he's trying to escape. He's gotta navigate the factory, solve \n      puzzles, rescue his fellow slime homies, and ideally would like to not \n      die. Think you can help him?\n    </p><p>\n      In Escape From Flare Industries, it's up to you to help Splat get out of \n      the factory. Jump over acid, avoid spikes, rescue your friends, collect \n      all the flasks, and fight the boss!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a08/a08b860f7ff23a57d14c3ff02604d512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["Team Alpha"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Helix Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
