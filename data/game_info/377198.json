Dirt Runner is a very simple platformer style game where the only button you need to press is the SPACE key. All you need to do is simply dodge the incoming blockades, avoiding the spikes and collecting the coins to increase your points. The game does take a bit of getting used to in terms of timing the jumps and each of the 4 challenges are entirely possible with a bit of luck ;)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Quick side note... Sometimes the game can bug out slightly and you can get hit randomly even though you're on a flat surface, I am aware of this and have tried to find a fix, If I do I will upload it as a second version. I\u00a0am also aware of the point counter being cut off at the top.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T04:41:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51b/51b6f5b680c829d00e272ad4b7da8377.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TomMorris01"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
