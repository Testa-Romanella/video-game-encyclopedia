With a large number of NPCs to speak to, opponents to battle and three playable bots to collect there are a multitude of different features to explore.</p>\n\n<p>Deciding to take part in the 5th Kajam late, I joined the month long event just 10 days before the final submission date. Despite my productivity taking a huge hit for several days due to a nasty illness I am still very happy with what I produced. I created this project entirely solo.</p>\n\n<p>Game created in Unity.</p>\n<p>Graphics created in Piskel and GraphicsGale.</p>\n<p>Music created with www.beepbox.co.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e0002df905c5dc5956d13bd127f3633.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ztuu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
