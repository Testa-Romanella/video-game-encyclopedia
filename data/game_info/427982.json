Each with advantages and disadvantages.<br/>-Special Core Encrypted items will further boost your characters armor, stats and abilities.<br/><br/>===================<br/>=== EARLY ACCESS ===<br/>===================<br/><br/>Our main focus during Early Access is:<br/><br/>1. Polish. Tuning items, enemies and overall difficulty ramp. Making each playstyle feel unique and rewarding.<br/>2. Animations - Character and Enemy - It may feel a little janky or rough to start. Stick with us.<br/>3. Sound/Audio - Some items are placeholder or have not been tuned.<br/>4. AI - You will certainly see them do some stupid stuff. <br/>5. Fixing bugs and incorporating feedback.<br/><br/>Things we probably won't change:<br/>1. General game loop - shoot and fight enemies to acquire increasingly better items.<br/>2. Map/Waypoints/Direction. - This is intentional for exploration.<br/>3. 'Mission' or fetch structure.<br/><br/>Things we would like to add:<br/>1. More Vehicles and mechs.<br/>2. Additional areas and procedural dungeon/vaults.<br/>3. Classes/Character customization to the base character.<br/>4.

NPC\u2019s will act as guides for the player, but there is no formal mission structure, waypoint or quest markers. Players are free to explore. Survival is critical.<br/><br/>Using a power core found in the environment, or printed at a Flash Production Drive, the player will reactivate Local Relays, uncovering sections of the map and allowing for teleportation fast travel back to that point at any time.<br/><br/>-Each activated relay grants a node, allowing players to unlock new items in the order of their choice.<br/>-Unlocked items will persist on each playthrough even after death.<br/>-Customize your perfect transhuman through hundreds of weapons and items.<br/>-Honor is a rogue-like, in that if you die, you are teleported back to the start and lose everything\u2026 except previously unlocked items. <br/>-Defeat your enemies and rescue the scions of Kala.<br/><br/>HONOR<br/>Superhumans.
