You are charged with stacking blocks on top of one another perfectly, and we mean perfectly. Concentration is the key to success.<br/>The blocks are actually thin red rectangles which fall from the sky on a plain white background. When blocks fall onto the platform of other blocks, the most recent block shifts in any number of directions until it falls off.<br/>It's your job to tap the screen so the block stays in place. If you wait too long, the portion of the block which tips over the edge of the others falls off, in turn making the next block which falls the size of the previous one minus the part which was shaved.<br/><br/>Can you beat your friends?<br/>Are you the Structure Master?<br/><br/>\"I downloaded this as a bathroom game to kill some time. What I was not expecting was to get sucked into it for hours.\"<br/><br/>If you love Tetris and other shape based games, this will be right up your alley.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6f2446bedbc7a57a555847549c1575_PTb0psd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ulrik Motzfeldt-Skovgaard"], "genres": ["Action", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Ulrik Motzfeldt-Skovgaard"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
