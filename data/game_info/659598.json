I tried to make the moment to moment gameplay feel like Pac-Man, while also adding in the teleport mechanic. Unfortunately I ran out of time and energy to implement audio and the wave-based AI, but I hope this stripped down version is still fun for people to play!</p>\n<p>Source code: https://github.com/Reccy/1GAW_2\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>WSAD / Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Touch the power pellet to teleport around the room in a clockwise direction<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:34:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e58/e5892b6b0c06e92e2929debdeb0414bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Reccy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
