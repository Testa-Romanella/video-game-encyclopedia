Every great adventure starts from humble beginnings. Learn a story of a young Earner named Walter, a story of his long path to defeating the Kain's Falcons and rebuilding his Fathership. Here is what awaits you:<br/><br/>Meet the main characters of the game \u2014 your friends, your family, and also the villains of the story.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Take your ship for your first voyage and bond with her. Aerial navigation isn\u2019t easy. The Sky is always hungry, so if you want to have a shot at surviving, your ship has to be your best friend. Study it, tame it, be one with it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Craft and use various weapons and attachments. Love customizing your loadouts? Black Skylands has got your covered. Take SMG, for example: you'll be able to equip 4 different SMG mods at once, with around 50 mods available in total. Some of the mods drastically change the way a gun behaves!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gather resources, build your first farm and grow your first crops. You\u2019re an Earner, which means you\u2019re an equally competent builder, farmer, and pilot. Never let your farms stand idle!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>And remember: The Sky is always hungry.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-30T17:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8b/e8bc2ba8808450c769903dd9e08b4897.jpg", "website": "https://blackskylands.com/", "rating": 2.43, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 190, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hungry Couch Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild"], "esrb_rating": null}
