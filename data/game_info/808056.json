Gather your friends and get ready to have some fun!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<p>An online multiplayer game where you battle against your friends in the darkness while your teammates\u00a0guide you through the maze.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>One person needs to create a room, and invite other players to join that room.\u00a0Once everyone joins the game, the players will be split into two teams. There will be multiple rounds in the game and the number of rounds depends on the number of players on each team.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Important:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Before starting the game, the two teams should get on two different Voice Calls since each team will need to communicate within themselves throughout the rounds.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Each round, one player from each team will be selected as the \"Fighter\", and will be\u00a0placed in the map. That player will\u00a0have very limited vision. Other players will be spawned as \"Drones\" for that round, and they'll have very clear vision of the map. The Drone players must guide the Fighter on their team to destroy the crystals on the map, and take out the Fighter from the other team.</p>\n<p>At the end of all the rounds, the team with the highest score wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Fighter Controls:</p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Keyboard/Mouse</strong><strong>XBox</strong><strong>PS</strong>MoveWASDLeft AnalogLeft AnalogLookMouseRight AnalogRight AnalogShootLeft Click / SpaceX / RTBox / R2\r\n<p>Drone Controls:</p>\n<strong>Action</strong>\n<strong>Keyboard/Mouse</strong>\n<strong>XBox</strong>\n<strong>PS</strong>\r\nMove\r\nWASD\r\nLeft Analog\r\nLeft Analog\r\nLook\r\nMouse\r\nRight Analog\r\nRight Analog\r\nMove Fast (Hold)Left ShiftRTR2Move Slow (Hold)Left CtrlLTL2Ascend\u00a0(Drone only)\r\nE\r\nRB\r\nR1\r\nDescend (Drone only)\r\nQ\r\nLB\r\nL1\r\n\r\n<p>Other Controls:</p>\n<strong>Action</strong>\n<strong>Keyboard/Mouse</strong>\n<strong>XBox</strong>\n<strong>PS</strong>\r\nPause/UnpauseEscapeStartOptions\r\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Developed by:</p>\n<p><strong>Aziztitu \"Azee\" Murugan</strong> &amp; <strong>William \"Gavin\" Lacalle</strong></p>\n<p>Music by:</p>\n<p>Eric Matyas (www.soundimage.org)</p>\n\n<p>MADE AS PART OF\u00a0<strong>JAM ANONYMOUS 2022</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T15:00:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/904/904d8653f69106d3305e3932095d7d66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Azee"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
