I had plans for a lot more bosses, but that probably would have been too hard anyway. Nine is a reasonable number to defeat, maybe?!</p>\n<p>Every god is preceded by two guardians. You heal 25% of your health after every god is defeated. Falling down the pit doesn't kill you, but does deal a lot of damage. The guardians begin to attack you after you destroy one of the three statues.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A: Jump</p>\n<p>S: Charge blast (you can tell how much charge by colour of magic around your gauntlet)</p>\n<p>D: Dash forward</p>\n<p>Tested with XBox 360 controller</p>\n<p>Enjoy! Destroy everything!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>There is no sound in the game as I didn't have time to implement sounds or music for the 48 hour time limit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T05:02:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2dbe54811593357ad426af345794a545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlackmothEntertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
