This is for the\u00a0Mini Jam 90. The theme is 'illusion.'</p>\n<p>The game is heavily inspired by 'Antichamber.' There's only 3 levels, and they're fairly short, but for my first jam, I\u00a0didn't want to overwork myself, especially since level design was quite hard for this game. Godot's CSG shapes aren't the fastest to work with.</p>\n<p>The main goal of the game is to reach the end of each level. You'll have to find keys, and explore the maze of rooms, which switch when you look away.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Movement: WASD</p>\n<p>Interact (doors): E</p>\n<p>Menu (desktop only): Escape</p>\n<p>Capture mouse: Left click on screen</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming/Design: James Czekaj</p>\n<p>Tools: Godot Engine</p>\n<p>Fonts: dafont.com\u00a0Space,\u00a0Simple Tfb</p>\n<p>Audio: freesound.org Door unlock (modified), others</p>\n\n<p>Note:\u00a0OSX and linux builds haven't been tested.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T04:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13f03590ea43576be20fee7974c0fc64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["James"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
