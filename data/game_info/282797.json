Its my first proper project using the software. This version contains 5 (pretty short) levels. It took me a while to get all mechanics and menus ready. I don't really need a donation (although it would be nice.) I would rather to get some feedback on the game, to see if it is actually good. There is 1 glitch I'm aware of, where you get stuck in the floor while sliding.\u00a0 If you find any other please report them. I just wanted to get a quick demo up so that I could get feedback.
