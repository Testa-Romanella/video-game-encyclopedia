The only defense they had was to create whales, specifically breed to act as housing for humans.

Although the whale regenerates rather quickly, the more damage the whale has taken the more of its blood will fill the screen. The crabs will not attack you, but if you stay under the blood for too long, you will drown. With your trusty laser and jet pack you must vanquish all crab invaders. If you use your laser too long it will over heat! If this happens you must wait for it to cool down all the way, or dive into the pool of blood and help cool it down.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T08:41:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b5/3b53d66ab2176cafa1a4fd60da4b7071.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Besto"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
