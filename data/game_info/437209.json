This is a demo version of the future game, there is no final graphics, sound and story part, but here the main gameplay is laid down (the game has only one scene - a scene for testing). I really want to get a lot of advice and suggestions about this demo, in order to create my first full-fledged game, which I will work on as long as it takes to turn it into a \"candy\", focusing on the opinion of gamers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>[Esc]</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<em>Escape menu,</em></li><li><strong>[W], [A], [S], [D] or arrows</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<em>Move,</em></li><li><strong>[R]</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<em>Reload,</em></li><li><strong>[LKM]</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<em>Shoot</em><em>,</em></li><li><strong>[Left Shift] + [LKM]</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<em>Accurate shoot</em>.</li></ul>\n\n<p>DevLogs:</p>\n<ul><li><em>by 29.04.2020 (23:05 Moscow):</em>\u00a0<strong>Added new Enemy and HP-regener, also fixed many bugs.</strong></li><li><em>by 30.04.2020 (17:43 Moscow):</em>\u00a0<strong>Added Escape menu and Main menu, also fixed some bugs.</strong><br/><em>UPD (19:23 Moscow):</em>\u00a0<strong>Fix bug.</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T02:55:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74c7fb4d5923e8e774320e51c95e5495.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TizZy_228"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
