The theme for the jam was \"unconventional means.\" In this game, you make graffiti in an unusual way, by swatting mosquitos against a wall!\u00a0</p>\n<p>In each level you will see a preview of what you are trying to create, then you will swat the mosquitos to try to recreate the preview. When all of them have been swatted, you will be given a percentage rating on how closely you matched the preview.\u00a0Tip:\u00a0mosquitos will move mostly randomly, but they will slightly avoid the swatter, so try to \"herd\" them into places where you want them to go!</p>\n<p>Controls: Mouse only, left click to swat a mosquito.</p>\n<p>Credits: Everything is done by me!</p>\n<p>I didn't have too much time to spend on this game jam, so it's pretty short and unpolished, but I\u00a0hope you enjoy it anyway! I might work on this post-jam so any feedback is appreciated :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:32:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23f/23f9f247df995b54a219080b5170c22a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cosmomoney"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
