Its theme is \"unstable\" so I tought a stapler which tries to staple some office gadgets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stabler is an endless arena game where you try to survive as long as possible.\u00a0 Might be kind of a bullet hell game as well at some point. The main mechanic is jumping. You are really slow when try to move normally. But when you jump you mcan move freely. Also you should hold space in order to jump higher. So you can staple all those papers to the ground. And of course if you are a stapler you should have some clips. Each time you jump and eash time you hit you lose one clip. And each time you staple an enemy. You get 5 clips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made this game in approximetely 30 hours in total. I used unity, photoshop and audacity. I hope you will have some fun.</p>\n<p>GAME ON!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T05:13:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/9691949f1a5b6c74701047d8a4ac1441.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Cyaygel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
