Can you survive their relentless march towards their targets? Can you stop them?<br/><br/>As well as Kraken there are also UFOs to deal with, that perform different functions (Jammers, for instance, disrupt your radar until they&amp;#39;re damaged enough).<br/><br/><br/>The scoring system is tied to your shields:<br/><br/>At Maximum shields, you get maximum points for each hit.<br/>If your shields are damaged, you get progressively less points for each hit. <br/>Destroying a &amp;#39;Regenerator&amp;#39; UFO kill will put your shields back up to maximum!<br/><br/>Additionally, destroying an enemy while your shields are at Max gets you a &amp;#39;Perfect Kill&amp;#39; for that enemy.<br/><br/>Each Perfect Kill adds to your research, and a fully researched enemy will make them easier to kill, as well as possibly stopping a certain trait (i.e. the jammer UFOs mentioned before would no longer be able to disrupt your radar).<br/><br/>The action can get pretty intense,  and I think it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun, and I hope you guys like it! <br/><br/>Thanks for reading!<br/><br/>QS :D<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter: <br/>https://twitter.com/Quantum_Sheep<br/><br/>Follow us on Facebook:<br/>https://www.facebook.com/Quantumsheepgames", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e2/4e2d03298248d73708c40945767fea6c.jpeg", "website": "http://quantum-sheep.com/attack-of-the-kraken-2/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Quantum Sheep"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Quantum Sheep"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
