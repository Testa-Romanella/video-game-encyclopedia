{"id": 46842, "slug": "interstellar-invaders", "name": "Interstellar Invaders", "name_original": "Interstellar Invaders", "description": "Interstellar Invaders is an arcade game which combines the game mechanics of Arkanoid, Galaga, and Missile Command in hand-built and procedurally generated levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou defend three cities against enemies, with intuitive and surprisingly deep design mechanics.  If all three cities are destroyed, the level is lost.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe foundation of the game is based around the mechanics of Arkanoid (and/or other Brickbreaker style games) \u2013 but with a number of important improvements. The paddle is aligned to the mouse position at 60 frames per second (on most machines) which gives maximum player control.  Players also have the option to use the mouse buttons to direct the ball for additional control while it flies.  No longer do you need to wait for physics to slowly inch the ball in the right direction \u2013 you can hunt down the bad guys! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is an entire armada of enemies \u2013 each with different attributes and attacks.  Enemy\u2019s fire can be blocked by your ship\u2019s shield and turned into a projectile to destroy the invader from which it came! There are also a number of unique power-ups and power-downs in Interstellar Tortoise that often stack up in unexpected ways.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe core of Interstellar Invaders is the \u2018Hordes Rush\u2019 mode, which is unlocked after beating the first 32 levels.  In this mode, each level is dynamically generated \u2013 the mix of enemies, their flight patterns and the environmental hazards are all randomized, so each play-through will be a different experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ce/3ce0ec6bc12fc9d2e5f8f6514c61def4.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/Interstellar-Tortoise-198941803435/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Interstellar Tortoise"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Interstellar Tortoise"], "esrb_rating": null}
