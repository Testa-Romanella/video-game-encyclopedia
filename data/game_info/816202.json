The goal is to find the exit of each of the three main mazes, find the Necromancer's chambers, and destroy him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here are some tips to keep your party alive:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Remember to guard: </strong>The \"Guard\" command not only blocks some incoming attack damage from enemies, but it also boosts the character's next attack damage!</li><li><strong>Map the mazes:</strong> Like classic 80s RPGs, there is no in-game map. While there are recognizable rooms and objects throughout\u00a0the dungeon's\u00a0three floors, hand-drawing your own maps\u00a0is an intended\u00a0part of the experience.</li><li><strong>Watch the danger meter:</strong> The dungeon is a threatening place, and the longer you walk around, the more likely you are to run into trouble.\u00a0The meter in the lower-left displays your party's danger level; when it fills up, a random battle will commence!</li><li><strong>Be wary of traps and tricks:</strong> Traps are hidden throughout the mazes. There's a chance you can avoid them, but it will be tough. Similarly, there are healing fountains, hidden treasures, and powerful items that will help you, but not everything you find is safe to use. Don't worry if you uncover a trap, however, because...</li><li><strong>Don't fear death:</strong>\u00a0If your party is slain, it's not game over; you simply return to your prison cell but lose half your gold (this cannot be recovered). However, most enemy encounters do not respawn, and shortcuts you unlock remain open. (<strong><em>Note: </em></strong>you can only be killed in battle--avoid enemies if you're low on health!)</li><li><strong>Small keys:</strong> There are a handful of small keys hidden throughout the game to\u00a0unlock special doors later in the dungeon. Some of the doors hide treasures, helpful NPCs, and more. Others are empty dead ends--or worse. But be careful: once you use a key, it's gone for good. Make sure you find them all!</li></ul>\r\nDisclaimer: THE NECROMANCER'S TOWER\u00a0is my first published video game, so\u00a0please post any bugs, errors, suggestions, or constructive feedback in the comments!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T11:14:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4dfe15787627dca8d49bedee4f229472.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Brendan Hesse"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
