While the demo features only one level, I have a list of additions and changes I would like to make to the game in near future. These include an overhaul of the graphics, more detailed textures on some objects, the addition of grenades, and destructible objects.\r\n</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that the project employs copyrighted music, but it is used only for showcasing the gameplay and visual style,\u00a0\u00a0not for any commercial purposes.
