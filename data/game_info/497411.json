You accomplish this by pressing the spacebar as fast as you can. The faster you press it, the faster you move!</p>\n<p>I encourage you to put your time for each level and see how you stack up to other players!\u00a0</p>\n<p>All audio is from the public domain, and all other assets were created from scratch by yours truly, with some help polishing from Jordan Resin and Gen Heyward.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>READ BELOW ONLY AFTER FINISHING THE GAME</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Yes. Your game was supposed to blackscreen/crash. The game cannot progress level 5, it is literally impossible.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a short game about my experience with\u00a0creative burnout in game jam/sprint classes such as Major Studio. I recently had a panic attack surrounding my anxiety with the career path as a GameDev, as I felt I\u00a0lacked the same creativity I used to have in high school or in freshman year of college. And I was scared about this class as I would have to constantly come up with new ideas for each and every week, and I would be graded on each one, with each progressive game expected to be better than before.</p>\n<p>I'm feeling much better about it now, but I\u00a0still wanted to encapsulate that feeling of what I\u00a0was worried would happen if I put out a boring/bad prototype. There are a few\u00a0small details I put\u00a0in to really exaggerate my feelings, but I'm not sure if they come across lol. The dialogue at the end was certainly on the nose though. Might go back and rewrite that but we'll see!</p>\n<p>But anyway, thank you for playing, I hope it at least somewhat resonated with you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/865/8656bb4475eab55f30db4bd7c8fed78e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Miles Logan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
