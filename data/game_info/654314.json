As the DPS of the group, the Wizard is able to deal\u00a0high amounts of damage in a relatively short time. The Wizard is able to use their special\u00a0attacks in order to deal a lot more damage more efficiently. When the [BREAK] gauge is full,\u00a0ensure you have enough MP to burst through your attacks, as you do 2x damage while the boss\u00a0is stunned!</p>\n<p> Cleric:</p>\n<p> The Cleric is the healer of the heroes. They are able to stun, deal damage, and place potions on\u00a0the field of battle for other heroes to use. The cleric is also able to use a regeneration spell\u00a0that helps the party for a limited amount of time, however it takes a combo to use as well as a\u00a0lot of MP. Manage your MP carefully on the field, and you will make it out alive! X X X Y Y</p>\n<p>BOSS:</p>\n<p>(A) Wave Attack / Flamepunch</p>\n<p>(B) Flame Pillars</p>\n<p>(X) Longpunch</p>\n<p>(Y) Spikes</p>\n<p> As the malevolent Revenant, these intruders must be dealt with. Each move you do requires a task\u00a0on your end in order to complete your attack.\u00a0Wave Attack is your most basic move, mash (A) to extend your body and extending it over your opponents.\u00a0It is one of the fastest attacks in your arsenal, and requires no recovery. This attack later\u00a0becomes Flamepunch once your health reaches less than 50% remaining. Flame Pillars is how you deal with the pesky Wizard at the end of the stage. Mash (B) until you\u00a0are ready, then raise your pillars with (A)\u00a0Longpunch is how you deal real damage to your foes. Mash (X) to wind up this attack, and mash (B)\u00a0to recover\u00a0Spikes is how you deal with the Swordsman, as you extend your body into the air by mashing (Y),\u00a0you come crashing down with a well timed attack. The better timed attack, the higher the damage and\u00a0knockback. There is a Light, Medium and Heavy version, and you will need to recover by mashing (B).\u00a0While preparing your attacks, you will not drain [BREAK], and you will take more [BREAK] damage than\u00a0usual. If your [BREAK] gauge does fill up, you will be stunned. In order to get out of stunned, mash\u00a0\u00a0all face buttons to get out of stun. Once the [BREAK] gauge reaches zero, you will automatically\u00a0preform a Flamepunch, no matter the current status of your health.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T11:53:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af312281069af51542dc93d6e490d9e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Playcrafting", "Hamra Digital"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
