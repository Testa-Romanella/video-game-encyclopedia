{"id": 974552, "slug": "stralbringer-shaded-arkarium", "name": "\u2200stralbringer -Shaded Arkarium", "name_original": "\u2200stralbringer -Shaded Arkarium", "description": "<strong>Rise to the challenge with your mouse-controlled player character,<br/>in this 2D bullet hell sci-fi shooter.<br/>Annihilate your enemies with a variety of 'Methods' at your disposal.</strong><br/><br/><br/>In this game, a single button press can launch ranged attacks, melee attacks, defenses, counters, and other actions. The free movement of the player character, similar to an FPS, and the ability to choose from multiple attacks with different buttons, distinguishes this game from traditional shooters. There are no typical shooting game mechanics like 'movement using arrow keys or a lever,' 'speed limits,' or 'selecting attacks by acquiring items.' Play more freely and speedily than ever before.<h3>'Method System'</h3><strong>\u3010Method 1: MultiShot\u3011</strong><br/>A rapid-fire technique that covers a wide range with simple mouse movements. Your character temporarily halts and fires shots that follow the mouse movements. Although the attack power is low, the energy gauge consumption is minimal.<br/><br/><br/><strong>\u3010Method 2: Blade\u3011</strong><br/>A high-power slashing technique for close combat. It radiates around the character and has a knockback effect. The energy consumption is small, the damage is large, and it can handle melee situations when combined with other Methods.<br/><br/><br/><strong>\u3010Method 3: Burst Lance\u3011</strong><br/>A powerful long-range weapon. It inflicts high damage, but consumes a large amount of energy. It can be fired in any direction, and it can also counter beam-type attacks. Time your attacks well to cancel enemy attacks and gain the upper hand in an instant.<br/><h3>'Energy Gauge'</h3>In this game, the 'Energy Gauge' resource plays a crucial role in your tactics. Each 'Method' requires 'Energy Gauge,' and without it, you cannot use the Methods. You can recover the gauge by grazing enemy attacks. The closer you get to the enemy, the more efficiently you can recover the gauge, allowing you to use more Methods. However, getting closer to the enemy also increases the risk of getting hit. Whether you aggressively approach the enemy to attack or strategically fight from afar is up to the player. Plan your strategy and seize victory!<h3>'Player Build'</h3>There will be times when you stumble before powerful enemies.<br/>In such cases, take a moment to upgrade your player character and challenge again.<br/>Purchasing and upgrading equipment from the arms dealer 'Serae' should make it much easier to progress.<h3>Story</h3><br/>In the past, the world faced an unprecedented crisis due to a full-scale war. Suddenly, an entity called \"Eternity\" appeared, averting the crisis of world destruction. In a world where atmospheric and soil pollution became severe, \"Eternity\" developed and constructed a gigantic isolation platform called the 'Arkarium' to escape from the critical living area. Under the control of \"Eternity\", people were living happily inside the Arkarium.<br/><br/><br/>Amid the repetitive daily life, Ai's heart was filled with emptiness and boredom. It was supposed to be just another ordinary day.<br/><br/>\uff65\uff65\uff65\uff65\uff65\uff65\uff65\uff65\uff65\uff65<br/><br/>There's a commotion heard from afar. Something seems to be happening near the ruins. The mobile soldiers of \"Eternity\" are visible in the distance.<br/>\"It's not peaceful...,\" but I, tired of the everyday life, found my feet heading towards the ruins before I knew it.<br/><br/>Knowing that I shouldn't approach, my steps wouldn't stop. Suddenly, the wind passed by my side. Followed by a thud sound, my left chest became hot. When I look down, something seems to be protruding from my body. At that moment, I fell down unable to bear the severe pain. Within my fading consciousness, I hear words devoid of sincere apology.<br/>\"Oh, I made a mistake. I'm sorry.\"<br/>\"But it's perfect. Can you help me?\"<br/><br/>I regain consciousness from the intense pain. It seems I'm still alive... as I thought, a barrage of angry shouts attacks from around me. I don't know what's going on anymore. I don't know what it is, but it seems the aim of \"Eternity\" is now directed at me.<br/><br/>And thus, my happy and boring daily life came to an end.<h3>Characters</h3><strong>Ai (Main Character)</strong><br/><br/>Ai, a self-proclaimed upright ordinary citizen living in the Arkarium, intended to live a moderately slack but earnest life. However, due to an unexpected event, he meets an untimely death. He was 17 years old. Borrowing the power of Maya, he gains a temporary life, but now finds himself being hunted by \"Eternity\".<br/><br/><strong>Serae</strong><br/><br/>A weapons dealer. She smuggles 'Artifact' relics that \"Eternity\" brought back from outside the 'Arkarium' through black market routes. Obviously, this is illegal. Serae supports Ai, who is being pursued by \"Eternity\", as a good money source, or rather, a business partner. The 'Artifacts' and 'Amulets' that can be purchased from her will be a powerful aid in your mission.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Maya</strong><br/><br/>A mysterious entity who (accidentally?) killed Ai and is being chased by \"Eternity\". She lost her body and seems unable to demonstrate her original specifications. While compensating for the lost functions of Ai's body, she lends her power to Ai to regain their bodies. She thinks with a muscle-brain mentality, always choosing to strike first, and think later.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-05T04:39:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/dea309c0a0dc9203b2bdc80bc38c932c.jpg", "website": "http://www.endless-shirafu.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Endless Shirafu"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Endless Shirafu"], "esrb_rating": null}
