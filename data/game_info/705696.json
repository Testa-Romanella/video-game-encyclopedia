You build entities (not sure about my theme), which produce gold. You have a main building, which gives you its full production value. After that you can build up to 4 vassal buildings. These give you a percentage of their accumulated wealth. After that you can build for each vassal up to 4 vassal buildings and so on. In order to have vassals of a certain rank, you have to be higher rank than them.</p>\n<p>If the clicking gets to tiresome, you can select a building and copy its whole hierarchy with one of the 10 buttons on the left side. You can paste it with the\u00a0 associated number.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>LMB = Select, Activate<br/>Mouse Scroll = Zoom<br/>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 = Paste Blueprint<br/>R = Rotate Blueprint</p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T12:38:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68d/68ddd1f95e8f93ad4517ff9fb36df7fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Korboh"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
