The objective is to not crash and gather up as many disks as you can.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe disks you collect remain yours even if you crash, so if you drive for an hour or repeatedly for a few minutes, you'll get to keep what is yours. Until you spend them to get cool upgrades, of course :-)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T05:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77c/77c6d6f64318f2ef1a4c18c27e67dcac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cashgrab LSC"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Cashgrab LSC"], "esrb_rating": null}
