All you have to do is follow the orders of these scientists for a month and you're free! Sounds simple enough and it beats being behind bars for the rest of your life, so why not give it a shot.<br/></p>\n<p>You're being sent into a college campus where there's a report of some weird dark staircase. Makes you wonder what these people are doing if they're just scared of the dark. Might as well get the job done and earn your freedom.<br/><br/><br/>Controls can be found in the Main Menu.
