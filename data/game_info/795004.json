This game was made for the #171 Trijam, whose theme was \"Watch your step\".</p><p>In this game, your job is to be the last man standing in the battle for supremacy of a staircase. You may conquer unoccupied steps of the stairs, and also the steps belonging to other factions if their stickmen are not on the step or are paralyzed.\u00a0</p><p>Your character may only be on one step at a time. However, they may place down tacks, which will paralyze an opponent that dares step onto one of your territories. But watch your step - your opponents can do the same. If you are paralyzed, opponents can ignore you and take a step of your territory even if you're standing on it!\u00a0</p><p>Controls:</p><p>WASD/Arrow Keys - Move the Camera around</p><p>Left Click - attempt to take a territory</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T14:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5e/d5e693935b014f09839942f278aa38fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MysteriousDeveloper"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
