(made for 48 hours on a game jam)</p><p>Relying only on inflation, deflation and the forces of nature (gravity, mass, acceleration) you must aeronavigate yourself through the air, try not to get killed and bump your opponents to a thorn.</p><p>Deflating yourself shrinks you and\u00a0 gives you an acceleration in the opposite direction thus making your movement and rotation quick. But you won't be able to push bigger enemies.</p><p>Inflating yourself makes you bigger and stronger but your movement becomes slower and gravity pulls you down.</p><p>You can also play the game online here (click the fourth game):\u00a0https://sdoychev.itch.io/hcgj-2018</p><p><strong>Controls Player 1:</strong></p><p>Q - Inhale</p><p>E - Exhale</p><p><strong>Controls Player 2:</strong></p>\n<p>I - Inhale</p>\n<p>P - Exhale</p><p><strong>Controls Player 3:</strong></p>\n<p>Z - Inhale</p>\n<p>C - Exhale</p><p>Martin Bakardzhiev - Game design and sound</p><p>Georgi Georgiev - Art</p><p>Stefan Doychev - Development</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:22:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/364/364c0570d0e878c2a58a430a2eb6bb09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["badlemon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
