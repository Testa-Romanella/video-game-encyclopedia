All gameplay and design elements were created by myself in blueprint during this time! Almost all assets shown in this demo are placeholder, excepting the lovely voice lines for our main character Jess, recorded by Kelly Greenshield!</p>\n<p>The final game will be slightly larger in scope, including randomised progression of loot and a procedural level system. All other core mechanics remain present, though expect larger varieties of enemies and weapons to come in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to George, David and all my peers at  NUA for helping to get this demo where it is today, alongside Kelly and Joshua Patterson for their incredible sound work. <br/>An even bigger thanks to my talented partner Sam, who did all the digital artwork for the game, and supported me all the way through!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T07:53:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f93/f93d4c200725dbf8eef2725ce1bff604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valkija"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
