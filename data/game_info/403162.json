You will also encounter community members who are curious about the knowledge you have gathered and will ask questions. Interacting with spirit helpers, knowledge holders and community members will earn you mino-bimaadiziwin points. These points represent your spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. Be careful not to answer questions incorrectly however, or you will lose some of the resources you have been collecting. After completing the first two levels about Ojibwe treaty rights and tribal sovereignty, help Tommy Sky\u2019s grandmother to make maple sugar by tapping maple trees and gathering sap.<br/><br/>Growing Up Ojibwe: The Game is great in any class room setting. As an introduction to Great Lakes Ojibwe history, it\u2019s a fun way to teach middle school students relevant content that satisfies learning requirements set by Act 31. In addition to information about treaty rights, tribal sovereignty, and harvesting activities, it also includes an Ojibwe language component with Ojibwe words used throughout the game. An easy to read points-system displayed on the levels screen can help educators gauge a student\u2019s level of engagement with the material.<br/><br/>For more information about Ojibwe treaty rights, tribal sovereignty, harvesting activities, and much more, visit the Great Lakes Indian Fish &amp; Wildlife Commission website at http://www.glifwc.org/index.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:29:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b3/6b360894f6494457e956c431abd8f971.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GLIFWC"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
