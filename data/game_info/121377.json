It's gross and amazing.</p>\n<p>Combining this idea with other influences (R-Type, U.N. Squadron, Einhander, etc.), I made a side-scrolling shooting game where the best tactic is to paralyze enemies and turn their weapons against them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently the download is a single-level demo, but there could be a more substantial product down the road...</p>\n<p>There are several canned game pad configurations that should do the job. With a dual analog pad, you can rotate the turret optionally with shoulder buttons or the right stick in a twin-stick manner if you like, as the latter will also shoot. \u00a0The right stick isn't required; Type E or F is probably best for a typical arcade stick layout if you prefer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can view keyboard controls under Options =&gt; Keyboard.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Mark Statkus for the killer tunes, Kevin Lane for creating the title image all that time ago, and Jason Flannery for additional art and feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d1/1d18dd2128c953a6ca1a82ef7c31ad96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["R9A"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
