Users can own virtual pets (&quot;Neopets&quot;), and buy virtual items for them using one of two virtual currencies. One currency, called Neopoints, can be earned within the site, and the other, Neocash, can either be purchased with real-world money, or won by chance by playing Qasalan Expellibox.<br />\nThe website was launched by Adam Powell and Donna Williams in late 1999. Two years later, a consortium of investors led by Doug Dohring bought a controlling interest in the company and in June 2005, Viacom bought Neopets Inc. for US$160 million. On March 17, 2014, Viacom sold Neopets to Knowledge Adventure for an unannounced amount.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T19:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abd/abd576521fa7ad0fd835707e29b87a30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.25, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 9, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Knowledge Adventure", "Independent", "Viacom", "JumpStart"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Knowledge Adventure", "Independent", "Viacom", "NetDragon Websoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
