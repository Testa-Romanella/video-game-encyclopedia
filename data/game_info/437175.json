{"id": 437175, "slug": "polar-penguin-racer", "name": "Polar Penguin Racer", "name_original": "Polar Penguin Racer", "description": "<strong>Story</strong>\n<p>Penguins are very playful birds, so when winter fell upon Penguland, the Penguins immediately began to make a racetrack out of the large Polar Ice Creams they found lying around their Pengudom (Kingdom). They built the ultimate racetrack and went about to race through the obstacles. The one who would beat the challenge first would be crowned the ultimate penguin, and be given an unlimited supply of Polar Icecreams! Can you get your penguin to beat the racetrack?</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>Name your penguin friend and get on the icy race track! Patiently wait for the right time and press \u2018SPACE\u2019 to run past the obstacles. Make sure you don\u2019t hit any of the obstacles, or else you will re-spawn at your last checkpoint And whatever you do, do NOT let the time run out, or let your friend win!</p>\n\r\nAI Players\r\n<p>There can\u2019t be a race without an opponent, unless you\u2019re practicing. Pick your Penguin Opponent (who will be played by your computer) and run past the obstacles before it does! Beat the computer player and become the ultimate penguin of Penguland!<br/></p>\n\r\nPC REQUIREMENTS\r\nMinimum Requirements\r\n<ul><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core i3 3220</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB</li><li><strong>GPU:</strong> Inernal</li></ul>\r\nRecommended Requirements\r\n<ul><li><strong>Processor:</strong>\u00a0Core i5 7500</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong>\u00a016GB</li><li><strong>GPU:</strong>\u00a0GTX 1650</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T02:46:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a596e7724f1b6badc8bdf9eb1fd7e287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["gameofpolar"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
