The idea was to develop a\u00a0specific system for a Mystery Dungeon game in two game engines, to give me more experience in an engine I know and another I don't know very well. Out of combat, dungeon room generation and inventory system, I chose to develop\u00a0combat between the player and enemies, making\u00a0a class-based system that would decide the abilities, the stats and how much health the player had. For example, a knight would have a lot of health and strength, but low intelligence and melee-focused abilities. I chose to develop this on Unity first, and then Godot.<br/></p>\n\n<p>There was a lot of scripting involved to make the combat system work between player and enemies, including getting the visual elements to work, such as the enemy and player sprites, as well as the abilities and how they work.</p>\n\n<p>Sprite and tile art was also created by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:08:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e7/8e7195a145d15256687fbd051deee364.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SolarSnowball"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
