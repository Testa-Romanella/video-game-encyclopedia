Choose a chapter to explore and feel unreal worlds filled with environmental enigmas, surprises and some platforming. Try to achieve the chapter called \"The Choice\". Surrounded by a dark halo, dive into ethereal ambience to find meaning...<br/><br/><br/>These poem-like worlds are linked together by  a  common  thread. Explore  strange <br/>places - from ancient architectures to abstract and wide stripped landscapes - to find it. You may also encounter strange life forms.<br/><br/>The only thing you know about your avatar is this misty halo. Cylne doesn't impose narrative elements.<br/><br/>But at the end of this journey, you will be faced with a choice that echoes your experience and might unlock some mysteries.
