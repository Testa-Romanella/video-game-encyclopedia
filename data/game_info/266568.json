As it turned out that was mainly because they thought the game would involve throwing real darts at real mice! Needless to say they were a bit disappointed when they realized it was just (!) another iPad game! Ah well... But once it was ready for testing they had to admit they actually found it quite entertaining. They especially liked to see who could \"build\" the most stupid looking mouse!<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Hit the mouse to get points according to the points on the dartboard. A bullseye will give you 200 points. A miss will deduct points from your score.<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/>- Build your own (stupid looking) mouse. Select body, head, ears, eyes, nose, feet and tail.<br/>- Choose mouse speed: Slow, medium or fast.<br/>- Select dartboard: choose from 6 different dartboard backgrounds.<br/>- Select sounds for mouse run and mouse hit.<br/>- Reset score.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca5/ca5b00df2a7252cc6c908f9d861136d4_sTwoB1s.jpg", "website": "http://www.martinecarlsen.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martine Carlsen"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Martine Carlsen"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
