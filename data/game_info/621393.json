Those two words are the heart of what makes Legos so magical so it only made sense to make a game like this (I was also had no other good ideas but we're gonna ignore that.) There's no objective, just like with real Legos, the fun comes from getting creative. I kept the interface minimal so you can easily go full screen and take a screenshot to save your work.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Mouse wheel to zoom in and out.</p>\n<p>Hold the left mouse button (without clicking a block) to pan the view with your mouse.</p>\n<p>Press \"z\" to center the view if you ever pan too far.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press \"i\" to toggle icons to more easily see connection types.</p>\n<p>Left click on an existing block to place it in your hand.</p>\n<p>Right click anywhere to open the menu. From here there are a few categories you can click through to select different block types and place new ones in your hand. There's also a button for selecting the color you want to use and a helpful button for quickly creating a copy of the last block you used.</p>\n<p>With a block in your hand:</p>\n<p>Left click to place a block. Blocks can be placed in the air if no others are nearby, but to connect them you need to snap a positive connector to a negative connector on another block or vice versa.</p>\n<p>Right click to delete the block.</p>\n<p>Hold \"c\" and move your mouse wheel to change its color.</p>\n<p>Press \"r\" to rotate the block 90 degree clock wise, or hold shift while pressing \"r\" to rotate it 90 degrees counter clockwise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/653eca4f25fb73a83091f3fbe577acec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["msciortino17"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
