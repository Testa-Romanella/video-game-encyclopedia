{"id": 1981, "slug": "lovely-planet", "name": "Lovely Planet", "name_original": "Lovely Planet", "description": "<p>The game is a first-person shooter with an emphasis on maximum speed passing - maximum speed, on the one hand, is one of the goals, and on the other - passing at high speed is more consistent with the circumstances of the game, it contributes to successful passing.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>There is no plot for the game, there are repetitive elements that carry the obvious meaning - where to shoot and what to get. Any touch to the &quot;enemies&quot;, any falling or getting a bullet in the hero leads to instant death. The hero does not have spare \u201clives\u201d, so you have to use the save game function.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game does not involve &quot;exploring the world&quot;, you can move mainly forward. But each level has its own \u201cmicro-levels\u201d contained within larger areas.</p>\n<p>The player has a weapon that shoots - but the blue squares that represent the bullets in this game fly much slower than the bullets, their trajectory is visible. This feature, combined with the requirement to complete the game as quickly as possible, creates one of the fascinating difficulties of the game.</p>\n<p>You have to shoot not only at fixed objects, but also at moving objects. For example, there is a category of objects that fall from above, and you need to shoot them while they are flying - if you allow the collision of these objects with the ground, the player dies.</p>\n<h3>Indicators</h3>\n<p>The game evaluates the passage of the level of a three-point system, where three points means the passage with the maximum accuracy and maximum collected items.</p>", "metacritic": 61, "released": "2014-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-18T00:49:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/458/4589cd61f57fe507df050370e16738eb.jpg", "website": "http://www.quicktequila.com/lovelyplanet", "rating": 3.08, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 57, "owned": 1221, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 45, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 62, "ratings_count": 78, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 80, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Wii U", "PlayStation 4", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["tinyBuild", "QUICKTEQUILA"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
