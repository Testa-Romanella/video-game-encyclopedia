Demonkind and Humankind have co-existed in peace. Suddenly, the Demon Lord declared war and began a full assault on humanity. All anyone could do was fight to survive. The question still remains: Why did the Demon Lord attack?<br/><br/>Notice Me Leena-senpai! focuses on the lives of Leena and her friends studying at the All-Girls School of Magic, where one of the Demon Lords minions has begun to attack. Why is the magic school a target? Will Leena and her friends be able to defend the school, her city, and her beloved food?<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>Notice Me Leena is a grid based tower defense game with visual novel elements. Fight your way through countless waves of enemies with over 20 types of towers to push back the forces of the Demon Lord! Maybe you'll find out why he's attacking along the way. Unlock new tower types to aid you in battles! Be careful however, as the Demon Lord has many minions, and he just might have noticed you.<br/><br/><strong>Demo Information</strong><br/>The updated demo version of Notice Me Leena-senpai features the first <strong>two</strong> worlds of the game and an additional secret map, which unlocks by beating the first world.
