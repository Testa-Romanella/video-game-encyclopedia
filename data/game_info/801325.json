The theme was: You are the monster. My idea for that was that YOU control the monsters in the game, instead of the \"player\" running the level.\u00a0This is my improved version that goes over the 3hr time limit (about 5-6 hours of work).</p>\n<p>You can see the original\u00a03-hr version here.\r\n</p>\n<p>Built using microstudio.dev. (My first game exploring this ide.) Took about a half-hour to get the sprites all set up and another half-hour for\u00a0basic game functions using the Quick Engine. A\u00a0little over an hour to get the \"player\" AI working in a rudimentary but tolerable way. Balance of time to get some better player controls working, add\u00a0a title screen, and throw in some sound effects. Another hour improving the \"player\" AI. And another adding more sound effects, scoring, timer, and more game elements.</p>\n<p>CREDITS\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Character sprites based on\u00a0Deep Night\u00a0by Vexed (CC0) with some edits\r\n</li><li>Heart sprite derived from\u00a0Simple Dungeon Crawler\u00a0by 0-lobster (CC0)\r\n</li><li>Map tiles from\u00a0Inca Game Assets\u00a0by Kronbits (PD)\r\n</li><li>Music:\u00a0\u201cCombat Plan\u201d\u00a0short loop, from PlayOnLoop.com.\u00a0Licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\r\n</li><li>Sound effects from\u00a0Groovy's Retro Sound Effects\u00a0by GroovyMaster\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T06:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e08/e08220afda3aedcae2d023912b731d34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blackhorse15A"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
