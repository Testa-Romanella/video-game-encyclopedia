But there's a catch! Not enough pigeons are sacrificed for the breakfast!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plan your train's route in a way that you sacrifice the\u00a0necessary amount of pigeons at ENJMIN to have breakfast.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>1. At the start of each level you are granted a short amount of time to plan the route and edit your track.<br/></p>\n<p>2. Click on the circular 'bend-tracks' to rotate them by 90 degrees and complete the track route.</p>\n<p>2. Once the timer runs out and the clock strikes CHOO CHOO, just sit back and watch the pigeons get embraced by poetic hug of the sacrificial train's slaughter.<br/></p>\n<p>To clear the level, the train must reach the destination safely and reach the minimum requirement for pigeon sacrifices.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>The Development Team</p>\n<ul><li>Thomas Foucault- Programming</li><li>Rugved Khandekar - Game and UX Design</li><li>Rebecca El Cheikh - 3D and UI Art</li></ul>\n<p>External Resources</p>\n<ol><li>VFX/Particle Systems by Jean Moreno</li><li>UI Art by freepik.com</li><li>'Thomas the Tank Engine Trap Remix' BG Music by Trap Music Now | Attic Stein on Youtube</li><li>'Train Station' font by dafont.com</li><li>'Kid from Hell' font by dafont.com</li><li>SFX tracks from mixkit.co</li><li>SFX tracks from soundsnap.com</li></ol>\n<p><strong>ENJAM OPTIONAL CHALLENGES ACHIEVED</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Colour Palette based on Pokemon of Choice -\u00a0<em>Kyogre</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>This game was created as a part of the ENJMAM 2021, organised by ENJMIN, Angoul\u00eame.
