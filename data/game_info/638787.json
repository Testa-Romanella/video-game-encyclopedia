Happiness, the standard simple feature of all such games, in the case of Patron is a complete gameplay system in its own right.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPatron starts off similarly to other games in the genre, but then veers off exploring social intricacies and what it means to truly run a society and not just a city filled with automatons.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEach individual citizen in the town has his needs, desires and issues troubling him or making him happy. Some citizens are more concerned with immigration, while others are more aggravated by tax-related issues. If the citizen\u2019s view on the subject is in line with what the town government (YOU, the player) is doing, he\u2019ll be happy. Works the other way around as well.CONSTRUCT AND UPGRADE\n  \n<br/>\nTo make the best of the opportunities in this new land, you will need to construct residential houses, farms, production plants, manufacturing buildings and dozens of other buildings needed to harvest the riches of the land.BALANCE SENSITIVE SOCIAL ISSUES\n  \n<br/>\nEvery decision you make as Patron will be met with different reactions from different social groups.

Whatever you choose to do can lead to unforeseen consequences years later.ADAPT TO WEATHER AND SEASONS\n  \n<br/>\nManaging your tasks and citizens in a timely and efficient manner allows you to prepare and adapt to external variables like harsh weather or different seasons.RESEARCH AND DEVELOP FOR THE FUTURE\n  \n<br/>\nThe world is changing and you must make sure you're advancing at the proper pace.
