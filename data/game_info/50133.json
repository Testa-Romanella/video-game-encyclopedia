You are equipped with a variety of melee and ranged arsenal. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Weapons: </strong><br/>Sword <br/>War Hammer<br/>Pistol <br/>Assault Rifle <br/>Sniper<br/><br/><strong>Weapon Blast:</strong><br/>Each weapon comes with a unique ability. The ability levels up with your weapons. You can even stack your abilities by purchasing additional weapon. <br/><br/><strong>Game play:</strong><br/>Quickplay. Free for all mode! <br/><br/><strong>Hyper Dash Locomotion: </strong><br/>We turn players into human joysticks. Hyper Dash tracks the player\u2019s acceleration with the headset. This allows players to control their in game character intuitively with their center of gravity. This allows players to free their hands and eyes to full focus on target and engage in high level combat. The Hyper Dash locomotion system translates the player\u2019s movement in real life proportionally. Because players actual movement is transferred to the in-game visual movement there is zero VR sickness.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a94/a949c71562fa63f1174806b0787816b7.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/FantomFathom/?fref=ts", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Douglas Liang", "Gorge Quan Li"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fantom Fathom"], "esrb_rating": null}
