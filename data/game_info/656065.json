Lorenz</strong>'s book '<em>The Essence of Chaos</em>'. Solving the set of differential equations when starting with certain initial conditions (speed and direction) leads to chaos - deterministic paths for each ball/board, but with sensitive dependency upon those initial conditions. This means that two boards that start a fraction of a metre apart, will within finite distance take such different paths that their position, speed and direction\u00a0are no more similar than two boards that started arbitrarily far apart.</p>\n<p>Controls\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Escape - Quit</li><li>Space - Start or Restart Game</li><li>Up Arrow - Move up</li><li>Down Arrow - Move down</li></ul>\n<p>There is a\u00a0key at the bottom of the game screen to tell you what each\u00a0 power-up does.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>(no music as of yet (sorry))</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T20:45:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a6/1a6b8ff05dce915677a1e1e4c067adcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Azoghal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
