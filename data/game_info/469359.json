As a Skyseeker, join the legendary explorers who tame these monsters and attempt to reach the summit of the sky, in a grand monster-collecting metriodvania adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a prototype! We would love your feedback on the idea!\u00a0</strong>We've been working on this early build for the last few weeks. It currently contains the first main stage, the Grand Crossroads, with about 20 catchable monsters, a boss fight, and trainer battles sprinkled all over.</p>\n<p>Download links to prototype are below. Any kind of feedback, no matter how brief, is helpful! We want to listen to your thoughts and ideas. <strong>Please, talk to us on\u00a0Discord or fill out this Google Form once you've played through a bit.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>==========</p>\n<p>Skyseeker is a game about wonderous exploration. We were inspired by the breathtaking worlds in series such as Made in Abyss and Tower of God, and we wanted to build a game where players can enjoy this sense of adventure for themselves.</p>\n<p>We were also heavily inspired by Pokemon, and the stories that you can tell by building a team of monsters that you choose on your own. Depending on your preference, you may build a team of fast-moving monsters to travel quickly, or a group of hard-hitting tanks for winning battles. By combining Pokemon's team-building with the openness of the metroidvania genre, we want to give the player the tools to explore as deeply as they want, or not at all.</p>\n<p>Wishlist us on Steam! We will be writing updates every week with new maps, monsters, and designs. We'll also be releasing periodic beta builds which we hope you all will try out.</p>\n<p>============</p>\n<p><strong>Explore a super-detailed, densely-packed world</strong><br/>The Great Tree Hyperion, stretching to the sky, is home to an ecosystem unseen anywhere else in the world. In a land of extreme climates, the creatures have evolved to match. As your journey unfolds, you may race with the axe-headed bears, duel an aggressive spring plant, or fly through the air with electric jellyfish. Secrets are hidden around every corner, but you'll need to assemble a close team of creatures to reach them. How did the world become this way? What happened to the race of natives, who seemingly dissapeared overnight? All answers lie at the summit of the sky.<br/><br/><strong>Follow your own path, and have your own adventure</strong><br/>Skyseeker follows a nonlinear progression path, and is designed for players to explore where they want to explore. The world is designed with very limited gatekeeping -- rather, you are free to venture into dangerous territorries whenever you feel you are ready. It may be possible to quickly capture a rare monster and escape, if you are up to it. Or, simply take your time and traverse the world slowly and steadily. The stories you make will be yours to tell, the world is simply a method to deliver it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T03:49:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8eb/8ebd284dff60daf79a5d50ca817d6b4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["kvfrans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
