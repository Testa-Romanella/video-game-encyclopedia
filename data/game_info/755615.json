The game's protagonist is a\u00a0relic hunter with a bucket hat. The main character clumsily stumbles his way into a dungeon where he would find an ancient dagger, which lets him teleport to different locations depending on where the dagger is. Your goal is to find the exit and leave the dungeon so that you can enjoy some free time with your new dagger buddy.</p>\n<p>Side Note: I accidentally switched the main menu with the ending screen.\u00a0</p><p><strong>===============================================================</strong></p><p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>W A S D - Movement</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Right Click - Retrieve Dagger</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left Click - Throw Dagger</strong></p>\n<p><strong>E - Teleport To Dagger</strong></p><p><strong>R - Restart To Checkpoint</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T07:47:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c4/4c4f9a63445c06baec3358c064481e37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Z3SPY"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
