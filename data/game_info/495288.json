The game has three levels, each with a different obstacle! There will be updates to the game that will have new levels, a hard mode, and maybe a new plane. Each time someone buys this game, %25 goes to Covid-19 relief\u00a0and %25 goes to the Black Lives Matter movement. I love making games and supporting issues that are important to me. So dive into this new game where you fly through the AIR and support great causes!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:35:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4c935890477d0b307b48335667eeea4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hamilton Bros"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
