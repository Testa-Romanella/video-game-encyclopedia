{"id": 417546, "slug": "dragon-gate", "name": "Dragon Gate", "name_original": "Dragon Gate", "description": "<p><strong><em>Dragon Gate</em></strong> is a top down platformer following a koi carp scaling the Yellow River.\u00a0 Our inspiration is taken from Chinese tradition where silver carp swim upstream and then leap the falls of the Yellow River at the Dragon Gate. They would then be transformed into a dragon after leaping into the sky.</p>\n<p>According to legend, the carp compete at a yearly competition to leap over the falls, and those who succeeded were\r\nimmediately transformed into dragons, and fly off into the sky. The transformation would take place at the Dragon Gate where the Yellow River\r\nflows through a split in the mountains.<br/></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>silver carp</em></strong>\u00a0 is native to China, and is renowned for being a great jumper. The player can collect <strong><em>Qui </em></strong>by interacting with lotus flowers to extend their jump and tackle the upstream battles to reach the Dragon Gate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Watch out for mudslides, vines, and obstacles such as rocks and fallen branches when navigating the river, using small ponds to move past these environmental barriers. Enemies such as <strong><em>Longnose Gars </em></strong>and <em><strong>Cranes </strong></em>might make this journey challenging for you, but luckily you have an ally, a friendly toad who will help you along the path to destiny.\u00a0<br/><br/></p><p>THE TEAM:</p><p>Designers:</p><p>Holly Bridges</p><p>Marcel Hannaie\u00a0</p><p>Programmers:</p><p>Khushveer Ahuja</p><p>Rishi Bhagat</p><p>Artists:</p><p>Farihah Khan</p><p>Tavian Butcher</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a90/a90d150c1866c5ac1b4d00cfb3942528.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ronchofuser"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
