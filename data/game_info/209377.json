A maze filled with laser tripwires. While racing an opponent. Did I mention the lasers?</p><p>HOW TO PLAY</p><p>Use the arrow or WASD keys to move your character. Hold shift when moving to run faster.</p><p>Touching a laser tripwire will cause the game to end and reset. While most lasers need to be avoided, some can be obstructed by pushing blocks in front of them. The game will track the number of rooms you clear and your best time.</p><p>To win you need to get to the end of the last room before your opponent does. Getting first place will earn you a best time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Conor Hughes"], "genres": ["Racing", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
