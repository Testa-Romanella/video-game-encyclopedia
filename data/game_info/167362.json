{"id": 167362, "slug": "a-tower-defense-game", "name": "A Tower Defense Game", "name_original": "A Tower Defense Game", "description": "<p>This is an unbalanced tower defense game in early development. It's made by only one person and it's not so good. It has only\u00a0~20 rounds, so you need to reset the game to try other towers. I know that there are some bugs, but i hope that they will not disturb you. Also feel free to suggest other background music if you don't like it and please tell me what would i change to make the game more balanced.</p>\n<p>Useful buttons:</p>\n<p>Pressing digit 0 Restarts the game,</p>\n<p>Pressing digit 1 gives you 100,000$.</p>\n<p>There are 7 types of enemies: common, strong, fast, made of iron, made of glass and mini-bosses. There also are disguised versions of every type of them, so don't be confused when some tower won't target them.</p>\n<p>Please excuse any mistakes as English is my second language.</p>\n\n<p>Music:\u00a0<strong>www.bensound.com</strong></p>\n\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>2018-01-05: Pause function</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db6/db6b0ca5a599c1d4137c7cddc78cece7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aleksander Purik"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
