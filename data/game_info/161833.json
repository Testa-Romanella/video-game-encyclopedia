It had a plastic tray, and inside a spinning platform with paper attached. Once turned on, the platform spun around at a high speed. The idea then was to drop paint on it and create swirling designs and patterns.</p>\n<p>Whirl Art is my attempt to reproduce this experience in a digital medium. While it is certainly not a perfect reproduction, it does have some interesting and unique qualities. If you make a mess (as I always did), you can \u201cundo\u201d it. You can also save your art and share it with your friends.</p>\n<p>Also available at http://whirlart.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/946/946ebd75ad6507ff26449cf9007de04b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["smatthews1999"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
