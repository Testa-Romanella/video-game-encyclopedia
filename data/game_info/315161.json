But every time you shoot you spend 5$. So choose your shots wisely and don't just spam.</p>\n<p>HEALTH<br/>You start with 10 health, every time you get hit by an enemy your health will decrease by 1.</p>\n<p>TIME<br/>You start with 60 seconds, you have two ways to manipulate time.</p>\n<p>Holding down L-Control will increase the timer by one second every two seconds. However this will also speed up enemies and their spawn time. Try to hold L-Control as much as possible to prevent the timer from running out.</p>\n<p>If you're in a bad situation you can hold L-Shift to make all enemies move slower, while you move faster. But beware this will make your timer go down twice as fast.</p>\n<p>POWERUPS<br/>There are three different kinds of powerups which spawn every 20 seconds in a random spot.</p>\n<p>Money - Will increase your money by 15</p>\n<p>Health - Will increase your health by 1</p>\n<p>Time - WIll increase your timer by 5 seconds</p>\n<p>SCORE\u00a0<br/>There are a couple of ways you can increase your score.</p>\n<p>Every seconds that passes your score will increase by 1, when you hold L-Control the score will increase faster.</p>\n<p>For every enemy you kill your score will increase by 1.</p>\n<p>For every powerup you pick up your score will increase by 15.</p>\n<p>SCOREBOARD<br/>There is a public scoreboard at the game over screen. If you want to enter your score, type in your name after you're game over and your score will be sent to the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>The scoreboard only shows the top 10, so if you're not on there you should try again ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/3627f795bb59486ebada27106cc1ce0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bartman-art"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
