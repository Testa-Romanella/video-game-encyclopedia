Especially as a paper-pushing office worker.<br/><br/>Your daily commute in the company elevator can be boring. Unless you strike up conversations with your fellow passengers.<br/><br/>Will you spice up your life and converse with your fellow passengers and co-workers, or will you just go on with your day-to-day life?<br/><br/>Make your choices throughout the workweek and see the outcome in four different endings.<br/><br/>==============================================================<br/><br/>**Made for Ludum Dare 37 - One Room **<br/>Created by:<br/>Splintz and DariusX2<br/><br/>==============================================================<br/><br/>This is the very first game my friend and I have created together as a team and also the first for this Jam. <br/>The game was created as a visual novel using the RenPy engine, and engine that we have absolutely no experience working with. So it was a challenge not only to create a game in a weekend, but to also use that short amount of time to learn the engine and its language and workflow.<br/><br/>It is extremely short and due to time constraints a lot of intended dialogue and mechanics were unfortunately cut short. A lot of dialogue near the weekend were ad-libbed and rushed so it gets a bit wonky around that time. Not that the dialogue in-game is all that great to begin with but I would just like to point out that fact.<br/><br/>So anyway, please enjoy this very short story. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9da/9da7c7247401f8a759df41d1e36bce00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Splintz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
