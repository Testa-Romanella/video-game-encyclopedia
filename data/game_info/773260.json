{"id": 773260, "slug": "comet-original-game", "name": "Comet (Original Game)", "name_original": "Comet (Original Game)", "description": "Comet - The Original Game\r\n<p>Comet is the first game made in the Comet series and it was released on the Scratch platform in July of 2019. The game grew in popularity due to being featured on the front page thanks to a certain user.<br/></p>\n<p>The game has had many updates over the course of it's existence including player made skins, Christmas and Easter events and much more. It is currently in v8.4 and will probably not get any more updates due to me having moved away from the Scratch platform.</p>\n<p>If you want to play the game on Scratch, you can find it\u00a0here\u00a0(no extra features are included there except certain users getting skins for free and a global highscore).</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:<br/></strong>Control an astronaut with a jetpack by flying,\u00a0dodging asteroids and collecting coins in order to buy new skins, upgrades and powerups! Watch out for the various random events that can help or hinder you! Unlock powerups that drop from the sky in game, creating an effect that lasts a certain amount of time! And if you get enough coins, you can even get a ray gun! You can also get achievements for accomplishing certain milestones!</p>\n<p><strong>STORY:</strong><br/>A sequel to the events of Comet - Galaxy, you find yourself on a moon of a nearby planet. Injured and confused, you realise that the moon is under constant attack from asteroids pulled into the orbit. Your goal is too survive and be rescued, but that won't happen because I never made an ending.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/>Controls can be found in game by clicking the '?' button (also called the 'How To' button)</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/>As far as I know, all users involved in the making of this game (skins, assets, programming, etc) are all documented on the wiki page which can be found\u00a0here.<br/>I will still do some VaGuE crediting here.<br/>Credits go to...<br/>- Mojang<br/>- Pokemon (nintendo please don't sue)<br/>- Sasnb, chipixel, Fission<br/>- Various scratch users<br/>- Other people! Maybe!</p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:<br/></strong>This game saves NOTHING!!! So all your hard\u00a0work will go to waste if you close the page. BUT DON'T FEAR! Putting in (gasp shock horror) THE KONAMI CODE gives a mountain\u00a0of coins.There are also quite a lot of easter eggs because why not.</p>\n\n\n<p>Extra stuff will not be added, but I do plan a remastered version at some point in the future (I will not say when because it'll just end up like TSPUD cause I procrastinate a lot plus there are more games I plan to do first).<br/>There's also an April Fools version of the game. I can put this on itch.io as well if people want it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T12:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/29627b61e9a9c703f5a07fa61b8c1514.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SyCreeper Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
