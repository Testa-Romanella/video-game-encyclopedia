I came up with a short demo on how I was progressing so far with Godot. Later on, I may improve the production of this game once I become familiar with Godot.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game demo.</p>\n<p>All Platformer assets were used from the Humble Bundle Pack and Kenny.nl.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec2/ec254bc0d7f66d6796e47dab72531326.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Galatra Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
