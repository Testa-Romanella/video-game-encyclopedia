Accessible, yet tough to master.  I know - it sounds amazing right?<br/>- Original soundtrack featuring a composer so obscure that no one has actually heard of him!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T03:06:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/8922d6edfa0c82b9a9fc883d7e0a1cef.jpg", "website": "http://www.phasetwogames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Phase Two Games Pty"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Phase Two Games Pty"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
