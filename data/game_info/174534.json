Well now you can download the timeless Parch\u00eds-style game and enjoy it with your family and loved ones (no matter how far they are) with Ludo's online multiplayer. The rules of the online game are the same as in the classic Ludo board game - just as you remember them from when you were a kid: Each player has a family of 4 pawns in their home base on the wooden board. To start the classic game and exit your base throw six with the dice, or if you can't, just wait for three turns and you will be able to join the game! Once you are out, the dice define your destiny - the number you throw is how many positions forward you move your figure. If you throw six and still have a pawn in your base, you can either get it out of there and onto the board, or move another figure - in both cases you are awarded an additional bonus throw of the dice. If an opponent's figure lands on your pawn, you have to return to the base and start all over again. If that happens, remember - don't get angry! As the classic Parch\u00eds rules state - the winner is the player who successfully gathers all his pawns at the end of the board. <br/>Features: </p><p>1: Dice - Rolling experience / 3D dice roll animation</p><p> 2: Crystal clear coins that will bring your old days moments. </p><p>3: Hot Seat (Play against Local Players Or Bots)(up to 4 player). </p><p>4: Multiplayer (Play against other players on internet). </p><p>5: Throw Effect </p><p>6: Works on phones and tablets in full resolution. </p><p>7: Classic Ludo board game 8: Classic Parch\u00eds rules </p><p>8: User friendly interface </p><p>9: Sound effects: Dice roll, Token movement, Token Cut. </p><p>Remember: don't get angry, follow the rules and keep your fingers crossed to be the winner in this Parch\u00eds style game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20b/20b4ad3ac85b56091337cadcbfc7bbae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Zebrito"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
