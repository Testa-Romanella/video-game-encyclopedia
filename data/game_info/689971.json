Commands:</p>\n<p>Right Arrow: Forward</p>\n<p>Left Arrow: Back</p>\n<p>Up Arrow: Jump</p>\n<p>Arrow Down (for doors only): Enter the door.</p>\n<p>This game is still in the Test Demo phase, so the game is short. For ideas you can always write some ideas for the next levels in the comments. The game is available for Windows, Mac-os and Linux. Ah! I was forgetting to tell you something important: If your antivirus says it has detected a virus in the game, wait 1 minute to see that there is no virus. Unless you subscribe to my channel. In that case your pc would die. Aha I'm just kidding (not really)</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl7TdK7Uv2oTSEg7phzQIng<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T09:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92d35da831e71415507b93b1dfe3f604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Player in Development"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
