The objective was to make a game with a NES colour palette and the theme was a platformer and or a strategy/puzzle game. So I made a platformer.</p>\n<p>You play as Blue Man. You can kill enemies either by shooting at them or jumping on them. Shooting uses up bullets but you can collect more. Get to the end of the level (there's only one at this stage) and defeat the boss to win.</p>\n<p>Though the graphics are my own, the beeps used are from Soundsnap and the music was created by\u00a0Kurtaudio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/2796b2d5403590816f7314ec1ef718b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Theta and Pi Software"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
