A plague has weakened the people with illness and death, while widespread famine leaves the few who are not sick starving. Bandits and highwaymen prowl the roads and lurk in the forests, leaving many trapped in their dying villages. But the sickly king has been blessed with a great vision of a sacred artifact, a legendary Grail of unending, pure water that can restore the land and its people through its power, should it be discovered by worthy hands. You have been chosen by the king to lead a ragtag band of pilgrims on this holy quest, and raise up from their numbers knights who will be worthy of the Grail and its challenges.<br/></p>\n<p>Created in 2018 for Ringling College of Art &amp; Design for senior thesis.
