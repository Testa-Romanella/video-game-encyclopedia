{"id": 406732, "slug": "without-exception", "name": "Without Exception", "name_original": "Without Exception", "description": "<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong><br/>Watch out; we all know fixing one bug can cause another.</p>\n<p>Made in 2 days for Wowie Jam 2.0 (because everyone was busy on Friday)!<br/>A small arena shooter wherein you can report bugs and add new features all while you play! Wow(ie)!<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/>WASD or ARROW KEYS to move.<br/>Aim and shoot with the MOUSE.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES:</strong><br/>1. The game has no natural end. Once you've seen the final boss, you can quit whenever you'd like.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>FULL DISCLOSURE:<br/></strong>I was told that small patches for emergency bug fixes\u00a0are allowed in this jam. I have repaired the following game-breaking issues:</p>\n<p><em>1. If the player was standing right of center screen when the second gun bug was reported, the gun would get permanently stuck pointing at the player's face.</em></p>\n<p><em>2. Projectiles fired by the final boss were invisible, and the boss did not despawn in between rounds/attempts, allowing him to kill the player while the menu was open.</em></p>\n<p>In the interest of being as fair as possible, I want to make it clear that some small changes were made during the process of debugging that weren't themselves bug-fixes. As far as I can remember, they involved only the following:<br/></p>\n<p>1. Reduced the size of the menu.<br/>2. Increased player speed by 5%.<br/>3. Lowered enemy projectile speed by 25%.<br/>4. Reduce the length of an unintentionally long spawn wave.</p>\n<p>I could manually undo three of those changes, but I can't remember what the original spawn wave was, and reverting the game to an earlier state would remove the important fixes. It seems easiest to just leave the changes in and be honest about them.</p>\n<p>If these changes disqualify the game from the jam, I completely understand. I would rather that than the game remain unplayable.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/><em>Art and Sound</em>\u00a0\u2014\u00a0PeterPoppinTail<br/><em>Testing, Balance, and Design</em>\u00a0\u2014\u00a0HoolAgain<em><br/>Programming and TooMuchStress</em>\u00a0\u2014\u00a0SoBad<br/><em>Royalty free music from https://www.fesliyanstudios.com</em></p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbd7708b9f90ab7e6c8d8323c8cea26c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoBad"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
