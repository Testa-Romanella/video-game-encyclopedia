Burger splat is part paintball style shooter and part diner game combination. Your weapons are ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and relish. As the sauce chef, you must splat the right sauces on the right fast food items as per order. It gets tricky as the burgers and fries move on conveyor belts of different speeds. Finish all the orders before time runs out. The faster you complete the fast food orders, the higher your score. Aim your sauce carefully and don't squirt the wrong sauce or splat the wrong food item. Watch as your diner gets messy with color just like paintball. <br/><br/>Features:<br/>-Fun and messy paintball style splatter<br/>-Classic diner look<br/>-Retro juke box music<br/><br/>For phones without gyroscope and/or older phones, you can play with joystick.
