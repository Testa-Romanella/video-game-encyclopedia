The Emperor and Prince were lost in the attack. But 5 years later, the Princess, Phea wakes up in a small village to the far south. With the help of a sword forged by the All-Mother, creator and light of the Great Ring, 5 other divine weapons Phea will come across on her journey, and a lost spirit of the long-extinct Luminats named Zuzu, Phea travels across the fallen empire seeking to defeat the Void King, saving the enthralled Guardian Beasts along the way.
