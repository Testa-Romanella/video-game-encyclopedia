As part of a secret and mysterious society whose members have sworn to rid the world of these Bad Guys, it's your responsibility to make sure justice is served in the bloodiest possible way, using your unpredictability to your advantage. </p><p> <br/>Track the Bad Guys, be brutal and smart in your planning, and eliminate them one by one.
