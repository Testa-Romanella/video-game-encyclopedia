This build was developed to test out the main concept of this project as well as to learn more about Unity and Game Development in general. Future builds of this game will be released regularly on my itch.io page so stay tuned for those as they release! In this version of the game the player will be able to Run, Jump, &amp; Collect items while trying to get to the goal post\u00a0in each of the 2 stages. The player will have to dodge obstacles along the way. If you get hit once the level will reset, and you will have to restart the challenge over again.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>Story Concept (For the Final Game):</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>The events in this game will unfold on a mysterious place called Takarah Island were the main characters are trying to find an artifact and its missing pieces that could save the world from utter destruction by an ancient god-like being. The main characters must keep the artifact from being stolen by an empire that wishes to use it in order to summon this being from the spirit realm for their own nefarious purposes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Give Feedback:</em></strong><br/><br/>Feel free to give me advice and feedback after playing the game on how I can improve as a game developer.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Check out the SAGE 2022 Prototype Build:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: LINK WILL BE AVAILABLE SEPTEMBER 2, 2022</p>\n<p><strong><em>Social Media:</em></strong></p>\n<p>@sivemediaprod (Instagram &amp; Twitter)<br/></p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/sivemediaprod<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Credits -\u00a0</em></strong><strong><em><strong><em>Programming, Music, and Artwork</em></strong>:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Louin Haze - @iarethelouinhaze (Instagram)</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/iarethelouinhaze/</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Prototype's Soundtrack:</em></strong></p>\n<p>https://louinhazemusic.bandcamp.com/album/nekko-chronicles-prototype-ost<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T11:38:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e174f03d877cdeb02881a0716d768a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Louin Haze"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
