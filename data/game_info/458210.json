I need your help. I'm from an alternate timeline, but let me explain.<br/><br/>Years ago, a toddler in a school far away from my county managed to draw a creature. A creature that gained sentience. A creature that managed to find its way onto everything. It would vanish from its notebook just to hop into another 2 dimensional world. It wreaked havoc on everything, paintings, governments paperwork...and when it touched those important documents, our world was ruined.<br/><br/>I managed to seal it away before it could doom the rest of humanity, right into this little game I created. However, it's not happy, not at all. I've sent the game here, to this timeline, to ensure it cannot destroy the rest of mine.<br/><br/>Now now, calm down! I don't mean for it to harm your world next. I designed that software to make it feel right at home. But I do count on you...in order for the demon to never escape to another place...<br/><br/>You must keep it entertained. And that means...to play the game. All of you. So it remains fractured.<br/><br/>So it stays neutralized.<br/><br/>(This game was made in a single week as part of my tests of skill, a series of one-shots I call \"Game In a Week\").<br/><br/>This is an itch.io release of the same game on Gamejolt, which you can also play an HTML/mobile version of here:\u00a0https://gamejolt.com/games/savehermistercircle/506795<br/><br/>This itch.io release is PC/Mac only, will not have leaderboard support, and was created with a donation option.<br/><br/>Read through the lines.\u00a0 Contain the demon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:52:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c062cf28331e0cf1012bd4a4fcdafa1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mister Circle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
