Look no further than LONPOS, with its straight forward \n      premise and large variety of puzzles to solve. Each puzzle revolves \n      around a rectangular playing field of 55 spaces. Using a set of twelve \n      pieces, the goal is to place every piece into the playing field, filling \n      it completely. The higher the level, the more pieces need to be fit into \n      the playing field correctly. Challenge yourself with two single-player \n      modes or bring a friend into the game and choose from more modes which \n      allow you to compete against or cooperate with the other person. When \n      you think your skills are worthy, use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to check \n      out how you compare against other LONPOS players or download additional \n      puzzles and backgrounds.\n    </p><p>\n      In-game content available for purchase using stored account funds.\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
