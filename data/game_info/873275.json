{"id": 873275, "slug": "iceberg-2", "name": "Iceberg!", "name_original": "Iceberg!", "description": "<p><strong>PREMISE</strong></p>\n<p>Your hull is badly damaged and you've no weapons to speak of. As you limp slowly home through treacherous iceberg-strewn waters, you become aware that an enemy ship is tailing you.</p>\n<p>Strangely it can detect you, but not the icebergs, so your best chance of survival is to lure him into hitting one.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>ORIGIN</strong></p>\n<p>Iceberg was originally published in 1982 in Computer Battle Games by Usborne Publishing Ltd, as part of its Usborne Computer Programs series for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, ZX81, TRS-80, BBC Micro, Apple, VIC and PET microcomputers.</p>\n<p>The entire series of 1980s Usborne coding books is available from their official site at\u00a0 https://usborne.com/browse-books/features/computer-and-coding-books/</p>\n\n<p><strong>REMAKE INFO</strong></p>\n<p>This remake was done in approximately 8 hours (including graphic assets), late in 2017 in DarkBasic Pro as a bit of a fun personal challenge. </p>\n<p>WAV sound effects have been added to the new version, a midi song, directional sprites, a graphical gui, a 10x10 grid (the original was 8x8) and mouse support.</p>\n<p>Virtually everything else is built around the original source code.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The .zip file also contains an \"Original\" folder, which contains a direct implementation of the original BASIC source code in DarkBasic.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>ISSUES</strong></p>\n<p>Since the game still uses the original randomization algorithm, it is horribly unbalanced. One game can be won in a single move, while another makes it impossible to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, this is by no means a full game, but just a fun diversion to keep yourself busy for a few minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T06:38:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95dd233c5eec057321351d202bf2464e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarcTyde Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
