This is our first time using Unity or any kind of game engine, so we'll see how this goes.\n\n<p>Welcome!\r\n</p>\n<p>\tWelcome to Pointless Wars, the multiplayer versus game where you go to war against people for no absolute reason! Use your brain against your opponent in this puzzler of a party game! In this game, two people go to war against each other, buying units to attack their opponent, upgrading their castle to earn more money, and even summoning meteors from the sky! Not only that, up to eight people can play in tourney mode, where everyone competes in a tournament to reach the top of the board! You can play with your friends and family (yes, you need other people to play this. Go find a friend).\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls and Rules\r\n</p>\n<p>\tEach round consists of two players, one blue player, and one red player. The main goal of the game is to destroy the opposing player\u2019s castle, which has 100 health. You do this by buying units to attack the other player, but you also must defend yourself. The blue player uses the W/A/S/D keys to perform actions, while the red player uses the arrow keys. The two players share the same keyboard. Actions in this game cost money, which you earn passively over time, or by having soldiers out on the field. There are four actions you can perform:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Upgrading your castle (Blue: W key, Red: Up Arrow) This action cost doubles every time you buy it, and it starts at 50 gold. This upgrade increases the amount of gold you earn passively by 5, giving you an advantage financial-wise.\r\n</li><li>Footman Unit (Blue: S Key, Red: Down Arrow) This action purchases a small unit for 15 gold that can charge at your opponent\u2019s castle. If it manages to reach the castle, it will deal two damage to your opponent. However, if it hits a meteor, a battering ram, or another footman, they will die.\r\n</li><li>Battering Ram (Blue: A Key, Red: Left Arrow) This action purchases a battering ram for 100 gold that will move slowly toward your opponent\u2019s castle. If the ram manages to reach the castle, it will deal 15 damage to your opponent. However, if it hits another battering ram, a meteor, or a total of 10 footmen, it will break. If the battering ram has been hit by more than 5 enemy footmen, the ram will become weaker and deal less damage to the opponent. The ram will also break if it runs into a stronger ram.\r\n</li><li>Meteor (Blue: D Key, Red: Right Arrow) This action will summon a meteor for 500 gold that hits the center of the field, destroying all enemy units that are currently in the middle of the field.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>If you want to pause, you can use the escape key or the return/enter key. Need some more help understanding? Click the \u201cHelp\u201d button on the title screen menu to see a helpful video!\r\n</p>\n<p>Money Management\r\n</p>\n<p>How does money work? The castle itself produces a passive income of 5 gold every 1.5 seconds, and each upgrade will add another 5 onto that. However, when the battering rams and footmen are alive, they will produce money too. The battering ram will produce 4 gold every 2 seconds and the footmen will produce 1 gold every 2 seconds.\r\n</p>\n<p>Setup (1v1 Quick Game)\r\n</p>\n<p>\tWant to play a quick two-player round with your friend?
