Enjoy!!!<br/></p>\n<p>Word from dev: This game is about killing bugs and helping your \"features\" (aka happy little accidents) come to your PC which represents your project.\u00a0 Use your mighty fix tool to get rid of the bugs while avoiding glitches around the map.</p>\n<p>The game is full of small and probably unrecognizable features that change depending on your life points, and some other parameters not explained in the game. Recognizing these might be interesting to someone.</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam ever and probably the first game that i can actually call finished.\u00a0\u00a0I could always polish it more and add more content, but for the jam needs i guess this is enough.</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music by Dinix -\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/dinixbeats</p>\n<p>Sounds by\u00a0 SoundBible(http://soundbible.com)\u00a0\u00a0ZapSplat(https://www.zapsplat.com)</p>\n<p>Everything else by Me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e61a712cb25bb6fda15cbb19578de7ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Cho00"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
