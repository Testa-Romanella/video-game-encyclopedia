Theoretically. PixelPauer is on the way to Amy and everything could be perfect - but the Cheeky-Brothers twart his plan.\u00a0Sucked into the booty dimension, he is now on his way, always watched by the brown eye of evil.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game has everything: Traps, holograms and a final boss duo - the cheeky brothers! (Somehow they look like Ben Affleck). It gets harder from level to level, making the dibolical, vertical grin of the cheeky brothers even bigger. They\u00a0\u00a0want Pixelpauer to stay with them, so\u00a0they don\u00b4t even hesitate to break the game. (whoa - how meta!)</p>\n<p>Can he escape the brothers' diabolical cheeks or is the weekend screwed up? You decide.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>the most heroic hero of the northern hemisphere</li><li>finally, a female Sprite!</li><li>holograms</li><li>fake walls</li><li>Cheeks, only a mother can love.
