It is inspired by the classic arcade game Asteroids improved with new features, like a number of different enemies and bosses, powerful abilities, use items and power-ups. <br/><br/>See how long you can survive in an unending fight against hordes of hostile aliens and enemy bosses. Fight through different stages, collect power-ups to improve your ship, use mighty use items to clear the screen of any enemies, but whatever you do <strong>never</strong> let your shields deplete.Developer Comment<br/>Aliens &amp; Asteroids is a hobby project of mine. Everything except the music was created by me. I hope all of you will enjoy my game and have a good time playing it. If you find any bugs or encounter any problems feel free to contact me at any time and I hope I can help you. I plan to support and add to Aliens &amp; Asteroids for quite a while.
