{"id": 559192, "slug": "sherlock-pro", "name": "Sherlock PRO", "name_original": "Sherlock PRO", "description": "Sherlock is a computerized version of logic puzzles, where you're presented with a series of clues that help you to determine the exact locations of all the images in the puzzle.  The puzzles are 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6.  Each row of the puzzle contains images of the same type (faces, houses, numbers, fruit, street signs, letters, etc).  The game scrambles the locations of the items in each row (without showing you their locations) and then presents to you a set of graphical clues that describe the positional relationships of different images.  You use the clues to deduce where things can't be (and where they HAVE to be) until you know where all of the images are located.<br/><br/>There are 200 puzzles in each size for a total of 600 puzzles!  The puzzles in the FREE, PRO, ULTRA, and ZEN versions of the game are all unique, the four versions share NO common puzzles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T04:55:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dad/daddb3e80a0594dc7ee5de6c3a2ecd50_31bEx2u.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Everett Kaser Software"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Everett Kaser"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
