The lights are on, and the front door is opened. But, the windows are all boarded up and the grass is overgrown. It seems like a strange place to deliver a pizza, but at least, it looks like someone is home. <br/><br/>You run to the front door since it\u2019s storming pretty bad. <br/><br/>\u201cHello!? Your pizza's here!\" You announce. No one answers. There's an eerie silence. <br/><br/>You are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you. <br/><br/>You just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this stupid creepy house. <br/><br/>Freely roam the house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by. Stay away from them, but if you do end up in a room with one, figure out how to stay alive. <br/><br/><strong>This may be your last pizza delivery.</strong><br/><br/><br/>===========================<br/><br/>Main Objective:<br/>Stay alive through the night and get out of the house.<br/><br/>-no blood or gore<br/>-play the game how you want, sit still or run around like crazy<br/>-turn the lights off or on ;)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-16T00:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/976/9762bfd7f122cb9c964b73976fc4b85b.jpg", "website": "http://www.emilywantstoplay.com", "rating": 2.89, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 172, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 17, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 72, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "iOS", "macOS"], "developers": ["Shawn Hitchcock", "SKH Apps"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SKH Apps", "Shawn Hitchcock"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
