Of course, the GBA has some hardware limitations but, since the game isn't too complex, I could port it without too many problems. When the limitations were impossible to overcome, I had to hack a few things, change others, put limits and so on.\r\n </p>\n<p>To improve the experience, I also added a pause menu and a way to save and load the world.</p>\n<p>Git repository: https://github.com/Vulcalien/minicraft-gba<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T11:42:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecfb606f9c1e7a5982ac0978e6981193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vulcalien"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
