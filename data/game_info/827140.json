There's also a shotgun/spread (toggle button) weapon that can be activated every time you kill 50 enemies, be careful as it runs out of ammo, and we also have the force-push/bomb (hold button) which clears all the enemies and bullets around you.</p>\n<p>The game will introduce new enemies as you go on but you'll also get the chance to upgrade your weapons and recover HP.</p>\n<p>Points</p>\n<p>These are the main objective of the game, every time you kill an enemy you get 10 points and the multiplier is basically that, 10*multiplier. You can increment the multiplier by destroying enemies without getting hit, if you get hit it will reset to 1.</p>\n<p>Leaderboard</p>\n<p>Here you can see what the current top score is.</p>\n<p>Options</p>\n<p>General tab: section you can control the SFX and Music volume with some sliders. You can also disable glow and particles for performance improvements. If you prefer the joysticks to be static, you can disable the dynamic joystick option.</p>\n<p>Control tab: Here you can control button size, dead zone, and joystick size</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T08:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad424528fa3fbc5287f3eaaa83d98d06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maavelar"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
