{"id": 812248, "slug": "big-flying-asteroid", "name": "Big Flying Asteroid", "name_original": "Big Flying Asteroid", "description": "Big Flying Asteroid (BFA) is a fun little arcade game inspired by the 1979 classic Asteroids.  You are piloting a spaceship inside a cave on a small moon, with asteroids flying around.  Armed with laser turrets you need to destroy all the asteroids before your fuel runs out - and you also need to avoid getting hit by the asteroids and destroyed.  Big asteroids break apart into smaller asteroids and can sometimes drop extra fuel.  When a cave is cleared, you level up to a cave with more and bigger asteroids.   See what level you can get up to!  Try to beat your personal best, and even take on the world record.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T06:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66d/66dd36ee66778d2d5400617ce0edd916.jpg", "website": "https://fury.games/big-flying-asteroid", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fury Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Fury Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
