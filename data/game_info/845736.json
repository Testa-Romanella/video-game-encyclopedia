With the lead monster doctor on holiday due to \"circumstances\", and a snow-storm raging outside, he is stuck with a patient (a cat boy who won't stop flirting), a lazy nurse (a wolf boy who transformed his regular nurse dress into a punk rock costume), and an inspection officer (a vampire), who is all too eager about bringing down the clinic. Among these mad fellows of cuckoo-land, an unreliable power box, and a burdening snow, can love blossom?\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Specification</strong><strong>Minimum</strong><strong>Recommended</strong>Operating SystemWindows\u00ae 7 32-bitWindows\u00ae 10 64-bit or laterProcessorDual-core processor, 2.4 GHz\u00a0Quad-core processor, 2.5 GHz or fasterMemory4 GB RAM8 GB RAM or higherStorage69mb69mb\r\n\n\n<ul><li>Project Lead, Production, and Programming by Alex Itsios</li><li>GUI &amp; Sprites by Xiaomilu</li><li>Backgrounds by dmr</li><li>CGs by Yamielsun</li><li>Audio &amp; SFX by Rinkaku\r\n</li><li>Writing by Pseudo64</li><li>Proofreading by Ra-Chan\u00a0&amp; txeoli!</li><li>Social media management\u00a0by A.C.
