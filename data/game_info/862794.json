Well, like Barnabas, you just risk being at odds with the Lord of all vampires, Dracula himself. And now, you are even more cursed. You lose your health every ten seconds, and you\u2019re thrown into a cursed castle.</p>\n<p>And now, you have to kill to restore your health and prove your worth. Or try to sneak and get potions to that. And you have to deal with a friendly(?) goat that gives you some sort of\u2026 strange advices.\r\n</p>\n<p>Well, you\u2019re cursed. Even more cursed, I mean. Good luck with that !<br/><br/>Controls :\u00a0</p><p>Arrows/ZQSD/WASD : Move</p><p>Mouse left click : Attack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T16:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa53f2a7e89479907eff855f90b62c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Sticmac", "Adnihilis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
