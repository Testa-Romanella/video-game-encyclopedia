It plays a bit like Go, but you take away nodes instead of adding them. Your territory is tallied when you are no longer connected with the other player.</p>\n<p>I'm actively looking for playtesters and masters of strategy that are able to find dominating tactics in this game. Please let me know your thoughts via <strong>mail</strong> or <strong>twitter</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>I'm still actively developing this project.
