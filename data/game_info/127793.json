The systems are all up and\r\nrunning and everything is being put through its passes. The crew are getting\r\nready to take all systems online after stress testing when an alarm sounds. The\r\nship shakes and everything goes black. Communication across the ship is\r\nscattered and broken. Doors wont open and systems all around the ship are\r\nshutting down. The First Officer is able to radio the player.</p>\n<p>A solar flair has wiped all the safety systems in the ship and the artificial intelligence has become sentient. It has started attacking crew members using the holo deck to trap them in sections of the ship. The life signals of crew members are dropping off fast. The player is the chief program office and they are tasked to go through the rooms and solve each problem presented.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9c3581e1ce17390df4bffe606118f6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artimus_Crew"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
