Their machinations send troupes of skilled pawns forth on harrowing adventures. Tell tales of a weird and decadent future inspired by Clark Ashton Smith, Tanith Lee, and Jack Vance. The GM-less, diceless, and low-to-no-prep system uses a Tarot deck and a bag of tokens to drive complications and spice up narrative. The second edition features a more robust challenge mechanic, additional setting lore, and further advice for facilitating/refereeing the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a81/a81deb566883eaab86fd7b747a45f961.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Parenthesis Press"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
