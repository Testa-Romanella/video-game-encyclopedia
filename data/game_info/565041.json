This is my first game so its pretty bad.</p>\n<p>The game was supposed to be about a bomb defuser, who did something wrong and has no other choice to kill himself, but my art skills are pretty bad so its just cube. It was supposed to be like a rage game where you want to kill yourself but you cant, but i didn't have much time so its just a cube that was supposed to be bomb. I might make it to the original idea later because I really enjoyed making my first game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>TUTORIAL:</strong></p>\n<p><em>I couldn't be bothered to make proper tutorial so you have this</em><strong>. <br/></strong></p>\n<p>W - Jump</p>\n<p>A - Left</p>\n<p>D - Right</p>\n<p>Void, Spikes and Red Blocks kill the bomb, but only some of them and your goal is to kill it. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:20:07", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KendyDoesGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
