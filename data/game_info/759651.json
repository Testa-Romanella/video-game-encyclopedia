The big secret! Box owners had the answer printed in the manual. The deal: publish a video on FROGS or any other of my games and state this question \u2013 I will happily answer it the comments!\r\n<p><strong>Q: Can FROGS be played on original hardware?<br/></strong>A: Yes! Original ATARI hardware is the ideal way to experience FROGS. It will be playable on a 1MB ATARI ST. An STe is recommended for the full experience. FROGS supports the 4-player adapter, Jagpads and MIDI-Network gaming.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can FROGS be played in an ATARI ST emulator?<br/></strong>A: Yes, absolutely! You need to configure your game controllers and map them to the ATARI ST joysticks for the multiplayer experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why is there no Windows-Standalone like with the other ANARCHO Ride Laboratories games?<br/></strong>A: Due to the various 4-Player controller options, it is impossible to per-configure the Emulator for every possible scenario. You would need to enter the emulators setup menu to configure everything yourself \u2013 that kinda defeats the purpose of the Standalone. In the case of FROGS you need to have knowledge of ATARI ST emulators.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is the boxed version still available including the 4-player adapter?<br/></strong>A: No sorry, all boxes and adapters are long gone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T12:07:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73b/73bd75d297da9181737cf06a98f56929.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anarcholab"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
