In this game you have to run an entire boat all by your self for 10,001 meters! This is a short resource real time strategy game, where you get to play short mini-games to do actions like add coal into the boat or eat food.</p><p>Glitches and how to fix them:</p><p>-Sometimes when you start a level you will be in the dining hall. Just traverse through the dining hall normally and everything will be good.</p><p>-Sometimes when you start a level your rock warning will be at green instead of blue, and will not change. This just mean that the animation got stuck on green. Since the game auto-saves after you beat a level, the best option would be to restart the app.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c06f131642d00afe2951105ced3f5fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giise"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
