The twist is that you earn extra balls for each winning ball that is called.  That means, if a number comes up and it rewards you a payout, or a higher payout, then you get a free eXtra ball for it.  You can then use those extra balls at the end of a winning game, after the normal twenty balls have already come up.  You can choose to have 5, 10, or 20 more balls be called on that game. In addition to the free eXtra Balls you earn, you can also purchase eXtra balls via in-app purchase.<br/><br/>Every Keno player has likely uttered the same words at the end of the game \"Oh, I only needed one more... I wish I could get a few eXtra balls\"  Well, now you can with eXtra Keno.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>\u2022\u00a0Casino Quality<br/>\u2022\u00a0eXtra Balls<br/>\u2022\u00a0Win-O-Meter<br/>\u2022\u00a0Quick Pick (Random Numbers)<br/>\u2022\u00a0Saves Credits Between Sessions<br/>\u2022\u00a0Variable Speeds<br/>\u2022\u00a0Bet up to 10,000,000 Credits per Game<br/>\u2022\u00a0\u2026 OH, AND IT'S FREE!<br/><br/>We give you FREE credits to play with every time you run out and you also have the option to get even more through in-app purchase. <br/><br/>If you like other casino games like poker, texas hold 'em, slot machines, roulette, or black jack, then you'll want to add this exciting Keno game to your collection!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/344b2bd1426f0327c2d9918824a00075_7U1kgFA.jpg", "website": "http://www.bimzagames.com/extra-keno.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bimza", "Keno Tap"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Bimza", "Keno Tap"], "esrb_rating": null}
