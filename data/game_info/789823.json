The game is go at your own pace and beat with your own style: If you get stuck on a puzzle, you can simply leave and come back later, or continue to advance through other levels that suit your thinky style instead!<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Triga, each level has a few golden triangles. Your goal is to destroy or knock any number of them off the board (See if you can go for 100%)! You are given a set of triangular tools, each type has a unique effect when placed on the board such as causing a destructive explosion or pushing adjacent tiles away. Try to create chain reactions in order to pull off more complex maneuvers. It is not as easy as it sound though, as the triangular board spaces make for some interesting and unexpected motion, and obstacles abound in each increasingly difficult level!<br/><br/>Triga is part of the CosmOS 9 bundle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-21T00:27:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb9ac2587ef5cfeb1dd1e09ef09a4ea1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason Newman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
