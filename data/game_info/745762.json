Evil robots will try to get to your room from 2 side doors and a vent above you. Check the cameras to keep track of them, listen out for movement in the vents, keep an eye on your power, and turn off the generator to charge it up if need be. But be careful, you won't have access to any lights or doors. Use your flashlight to peer into the darkness around you. Although you may not like what you see.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame contains Flashing lights, and loud jumpscares. If either of these things can effect you, please take caution when playing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T02:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c3391806e97acb0b145ec2bbbce465f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gigsjaw"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gigsjaw"], "esrb_rating": null}
