Once a year, at the solstice, the guardian proceed to a big ceremony where he reactivates the Orb for a full year and where he gets the vital force needed to survive until the next solstice comes. <br/></p>\n<p>You play <strong><em>Pan</em></strong>,  the grandchild of the Guardian, and you'll have to solve the mystery of the Orb's disappearing in order to get the precious totem back on its socle in time for the Ceremony of the Solstice.
