It's a quick game meant to be played all the way through in one sitting, and can be played using your keyboard or an Xbox controller. </p><p>This is my first video game, and I made it in GameMaker: Studio. I learned how to use GameMaker and program a platform game from HeartBeast's Become a Game Maker with GameMaker Studio course on Udemy. If you would like to make games in GameMaker, I would highly recommend this course; it's worth every penny! He also has a Youtube channel with free content. </p><p>I'm offering this game for free; however, I did spend a long time on it. So if you end up enjoying this game a lot, please support me by spreading the word about the game or by sending a small donation. The game is an .exe file, so you'll need a Windows computer to play it. I'm open to developing it on other platforms if people like it enough. </p><p><strong>*Update* </strong>I uploaded a new version of Cave Escape that was recompiled to potentially make the game run faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6c58860a61e1390cab970a5c0bd1f3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Esdidubs"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
