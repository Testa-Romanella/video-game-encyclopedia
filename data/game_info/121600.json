On the left, the unit icons. When you click them, you convert the cost of energy on the icons into units that then get built. On the right, te upgrades icons. When you click on them, it will upgrade the stats of your units (at a cost also).</p>\n<p>At the center, you can see units that are \u201cin construction\u201d (as well as those getting upgraded), all waiting in the queue.</p>\n<p>BEWARE: the energy you spend on creating units is your life too!!! Don\u2019t let it get to 0 or you lose the game!</p>\n<p>The map icon at the top left of the screen will take you to the map screen (the ones with all the villages).</p>\n<p>Map screen :</p>\n<p>Your base is the tower at the bottom of the map. The other cities are there for you to destroy them!</p>\n<p>In order to do that, create some units using the flask screen first. Then, click on the tower, you army will be displayed in a pop-up message.</p>\n<p>If you want to move them in order to attack a village, click on the button \u201cselect\u201d on the pop-up message.</p>\n<p>Then, click on a village and click \u201cattack\u201d. BEWARE: if you\u2019re defeated, there is no feedback in the game\u2026 sorry</p>\n<p>If a village has a flag on it, it means that some of your units are in that village.</p>\n<p>You can then click on that flag, select your units and move them in order for them to attack the next village (or regroup with the rest of your army in a different village before attacking, for example).</p>\n<p>When you attack a village, you gain some energy!!! And that doesn\u2019t depend on the combat\u2019s outcome.</p>\n<p>That should get you started if you\u2019re a bit confused.
