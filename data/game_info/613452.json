{"id": 613452, "slug": "exit-condition-one", "name": "Exit Condition One", "name_original": "Exit Condition One", "description": "<p>This is a classic escape room game built exclusively for VR using roomscale. Walking is fully supported. There's no objects passing through each other, ghost hands, or guessing if you can manipulate an object. Everything is designed to make you feel like you are really there. The puzzles are all tightly interwoven into the room and feel more like problems that need to be solved rather than puzzles that need to be figured out. It works best with a 6'x8' room, but locomotion and teleport are both supported. There's enough puzzles for about an hour of playtime.</p>\n<p><strong>Early Access</strong></p>\n<p>The number of puzzles and the play mechanics are more or less final. Some of the game objects are placeholders for final art. I'm primarily looking for feedback on the playthrough time, where things are unnecessarily hard because expectations are set poorly, that sort of thing. You can provide feedback by leaving a comment or review or\u00a0joining the Discord here:\u00a0https://discord.gg/2NfBumhKQD\u00a0.\r\n</p>\n<p>I'll be making regular updates based on feeback. If you love escape room games, help me make this the best it can be and if it does well I'll make more!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T12:21:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8f/a8f683d86bd8862e820f2c540bd34d7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["damonbpoole"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
