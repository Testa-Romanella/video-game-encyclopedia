It is splitted into two separate scenarios. One of two main characters in the game Sam, a strange human-sized dog does not appear at the beginning of the game as players should wait for him a long time. Now Sam has to stop antagonists of both previous games and find those who took Max\u2019s brain while he was in the bathroom. There are also strange flashbacks into the past, where we can see different versions of well-known characters. <br />\nThe gameplay as all the other entries in the series is divided in to small episodes where the player has to solve various different puzzles while controlling interesting and fun characters but this episode features a slightly new gameplay style with Sam searching alone for thieves in noir fashion using only dialogue options. He searches till he finds two villains from previous games General Skun-ka&#39;pe and Monsieur Papierwaite in the museum. They are thieves Sam was searching for. Now, Sam has to defeat them and give back Max\u2019s\u2019 brain with the help of other new characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:38:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/6716b656707c65cdf21882ee51b4f2ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.93, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 123, "owned": 1855, "beaten": 34, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 15}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 71, "suggestions_count": 381, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 71, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
