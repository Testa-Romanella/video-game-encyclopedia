I wanted to see if it was possible to cast spells with your voice, and it totally is!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Video demonstration: link<br/></p>\n<p>[IMPORTANT] - Only works on Windows machines. If using your voice doesn't work, make sure to do the following: <br/></p>\n<p>1. Make sure your windows speech language set to English. Do this by going into settings, search for Speech and set the spoken language.</p>\n<p>2. Make sure only one microphone is connected to your computer at a time. If more than one mic is connected, sometimes the game picks the wrong microphone as input and then it won't work. <br/></p>\n<p>The above should be enough. Also remember to speak clearly, the voice recognition is a little spotty. <br/></p>\n\n<p>CREDIT: Voice activation is done through microsoft window's Unity voice API package - see https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Windows.Speech.KeywordRecognizer.html</p>\n<p>Some of the shader effects were made possible by the awesome tutorials from Gabriel Aguiar Prod. - see https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtb1s859RTxx-RIgFs5ZVQA</p>\n<p>SFX: From zapslat.com &amp; fesliyanstudios.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:34:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/596/596f13d47bc8945be33d32b964810dbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wesslo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
