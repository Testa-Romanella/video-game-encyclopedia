Put your controllers down in this Hand Tracking experience to navigate through space.\r\n</p>\n<p>Start off as a small terrestrial planet looking for other planets to absorb. If the planet you collide with is smaller than you, you absorb it, if the planet is larger than you, it absorbs you. Sounds simple, right? But when you are surrounded with hundreds of spinning planets and asteroids trying to take you out, that's when things get exciting!\r\n</p>\n<p>I am a solo developer that makes these games so everyone can play for free. If you enjoy this game please leave a review to show your support. Do check out the other games I\u2019ve made!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0I have not been able to test this one the Quest 1, so I am not sure how well it runs, but it works great on the Quest 2. If anyone out there plays it on the Quest 1 please let me know how it runs</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T04:22:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aacabc16de98ad018de97a5187eaeaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Noodlesthenoob"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
