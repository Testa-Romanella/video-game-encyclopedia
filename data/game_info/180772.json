First device a plan, then draw! Red balls can effect blue gravity inverters and thereby change the gravity of blue balls, making every level a challenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8e/f8e0d0ad7614cb210a7ca6edc14bf82c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Octacube Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
