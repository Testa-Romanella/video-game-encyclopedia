It is recommended to guess the time within 1 second for better accuracy.</p>\n<p>When in \"Dead\u00a0Eye\" mode, you will mark the locations that you want to hit.</p>\n<p>Shooting different body parts will cause different amount of damage.

I always wanted to make a cowboy duel game that is fair and challenging! I have modified the post processing value to reproduce a vintage movie feel.\u00a0\u00a0And I am very happy that I am able to recreate the \"Dead Eye\" shooting system from Red Dead Redemption.</p>\n<p>Asset used:\u00a0buildings, guns, music and UI</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T13:45:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/012451e20394e46656f031734d1c5595.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heiwa"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
