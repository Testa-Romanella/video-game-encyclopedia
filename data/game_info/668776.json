{"id": 668776, "slug": "asteroids-rx", "name": "Asteroids RX", "name_original": "Asteroids RX", "description": "<p>Asteroids RX is a 'from scratch' conversion of two classic Atari games, Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe. It was chosen in a poll by my supporters on Patron as a game for me to convert. Versions for the 48k,128k and a version with\u00a0Spectrum Next enhancements are included.<br/><br/>This game was coded by myself in 100% machine code, in my bedroom! The 14-year old kid I used to be has therefore told me to dedicate this game to Sir Clive Sinclair, the man who made it possible for all of us Spectrum fans, and who sadly passed away just a few days before\u00a0the release.<br/><br/>Note that whilst you can buy this game here as a one-off, you might want to consider supporting me on Patreon instead. This game is included as part of that subscription, as well as my full back catalogue. The cost of a month's subscription is less than the price of this game.<br/><br/>www.patreon.com/happycodingzx<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T07:50:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3c/b3cfb3740f14748486063ca0464f4b74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["highriser"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
