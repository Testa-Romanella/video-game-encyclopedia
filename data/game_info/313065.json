They are not listening to reason and due to the strict labour laws you cannot fire any of the workers. What to do?<br/></p>\n<p>Simple, incentivize  the workers to pull long hours with overtime bonuses and they'll surely burn out and leave with a fresh face taking the hot seat. Reach <strong>20000\u20ac</strong> to prove the profitability of the project and maybe you are given a proper budget next time.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Click</em> buttons to <strong>continue</strong> (or use the space bar)<br/><em>Click</em> workers to see their <strong>stats</strong><br/><em>Click</em> the sliders to change <strong>overtime bonuses</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Developer's comments</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Well gee</em>, I had big plans for the visuals and the tutorial, but here we are with a barely functional simulation.
