We appreciate any feedback in reviews to make it better.<br/><br/>Are you ready to take a break from the ordinary life in a new amazing world? Perhaps you could just help the ball to get out of the maze.<br/><br/>The universe of Qbertium is not like what you've seen before. It contains a bunch of unique worlds, each of them has its own maze. And... all you need is to find a way out.<br/><br/>It will not be easy thing to do though. The ball constantly gains speed, the maze is not plane and even more dangerous threats are waiting ahead.<br/><br/>UNIQUE GAMEPLAY<br/>The game is a mix of different genres: ball-rolling, runner, puzzle. In short, this is a ball - maze - runner.<br/><br/>AWESOME 3D GRAPHICS<br/>Landscapes of different worlds look great. Every maze has its own unique setting.<br/><br/>ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC<br/>Thanks to the rhythmic tracks, you can fully penetrate the tempo and enjoy the speed of the ball.<br/><br/>EASY CONTROLS<br/>Just swipe ... Quick swipe.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:13:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18f/18f436c72efb0b648d09a4ef58a3792d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alexander Bouland"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Alexander Bouland"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
