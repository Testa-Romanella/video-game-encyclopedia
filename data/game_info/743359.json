All art was made by me within GameMaker Studio 2 and Aseprite\u00a0\u00a0while all sounds were sourced for free from Freesound.org. The game definitely follows the idea of a time limit more loosely, as it is more timer based, but I feel as though it still fits the theme as you are limited by the time you have before gravity switches, hence adding in a time limit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T11:20:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/702/70226501de1f32d8224d59cc4c87c7cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["benhen_26"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
