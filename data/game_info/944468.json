You are stuck in a cave system and can't reach the surface. You must use the roots from the dirt at the top of the world to create tools and use the few resources around you to advance through the game and eventually fight the bosses. As you work your way through the tech tree, you will discover more advanced and efficient methods of cooking, butchering, curing, crafting, hunting and more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Boss fights:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Snail<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The Snail is going to be a boss fight in which u must kill a giant snail. This snail is going to leave a trail, which slows you down and deals damage, as it moves around. If the snail is too low on HP, it will curl up into its shell. During this period of time, the player cannot damage the snail normaly, instead having to weaken the rock above it to crack the snails shell, in tern killing it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Frog<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The frog will be in a found in a partially water-filled cave. If at any point during the boss fight the player touches the frog's back, the player will start<strong> </strong>hallucinating (the screen will begin to distort and have an RGB shift effect). The frog also has a high jump, and a really long tongue that it can snap at the player with. When the player gets hit by the tongue, the player will be stuck to the tongue and as the tongue retracts, the player will be dragged along with it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Grizzly Bear<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Nothing too special about this one.
