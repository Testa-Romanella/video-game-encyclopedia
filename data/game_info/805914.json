If you like it, let\u00a0 me know in the comments, and I'll continue development. The goal of the demo is to find out why the victim was killed (hint: they have a mobile device on them, and their email application may have a hint).</strong></p>\r\nMovement\r\n<p>Use the mouse to move across the map. Click where you would like the character to go and the pathfinding will make their way there.</p>\n<p>You can walk towards NPCs to automatically start a conversation and move towards a device to automatically connect to it over adb.</p>\r\nDialogue\r\n<p>Dialogue starts when you reach an NPC who has something to say. Once they've finished talking the dialogue will disappear.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Terminal and Commands\r\n<p>Press 'esc' to open your terminal.
