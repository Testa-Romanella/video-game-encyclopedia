Of course, to keep the population in check you have to balance between their happiness and belief in you. This means that you must perform sacrifices in order to increase their belief... you get rewards back from the Gods so it's all good<br/><strong><em>you are using their LIFE AS CURRENCY for resources, food and their belief in you</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - camera move<br/>QE - camera rotate<br/>ZX - camera zoom</p>\n<p>and the mouse (which is seriously goofy - especially the rotate!)</p>\n<p>All coding by moi!<br/>All artwork by moi!<br/>All crappy sounds by as3fxr!</p>\n<p>Major to-dos:<br/>Sometimes the game crashes.
