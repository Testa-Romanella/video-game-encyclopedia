A short, casual open world exploration game (maybe a metroidvania if you count all the backtracking) made in under 24 hours (non-continuous) for the GDS Fall-O-Ween 2020 jam.</p>\n<p>The challenge - in a similar vein to Miz jam - was to use the GDS Fall-O-Ween 2020 art kit by frecklebars in the most creative way possible. All art in the game is from that kit, most of it modified in some way.</p>\n<p>Music is by yours truly. My goal with this jam was to show myself I can make both a game and it's soundtrack quickly to a reasonable degree of quality. The open world aspect is just an idea that got out of hand, and honestly if there are any bugs now you know why \ud83d\ude05 I'm pretty happy with how the music turned out - considering that it was made in a panicked frenzy near the end - and you can download it below for free.
