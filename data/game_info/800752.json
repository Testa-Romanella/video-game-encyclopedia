Try to be as precise as possible on the target to earn more points. Also try to use the least cloud possible because each remaining cloud will give you 1 point. And finally try to get the coins because they will give you 2 points each.</p>\n<p>He is very weak so avoid the helicopter.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 3 Days for the ScoreSpace Jam #19.</p>\n<p>Everything was made by\u00a0me , except the music wich was made by a friend. (Even the sound effects were made by me) I only used LootLocker for the leaderboard.<br/></p>\n<p>If you want a smoother version you can still download the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T16:04:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bca/bca272d38c9121f0036524d553b9d435.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["xquentoux"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
