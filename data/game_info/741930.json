Never managed to track this down.<br/>- Healthbars stopped following camera.<br/>- Setting and back button broke in last build. Settings should be removed since volume is on main page now.<br/>- Caravan movement is weird.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>GIldar<br/>Messy project Architecture :)<br/>Programming<br/>Menu and cover art<br/>Scene generation<br/>Asset integration<br/><br/></p><p>Khamme<br/>Programming<br/>Animation setup and integration<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:59:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c93/c9333c46f6f5d20b64ef508b7c7b4552.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GildarGaming"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
