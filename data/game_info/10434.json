So before you buy an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, use VRMark to see whether your PC has what it takes to deliver a great VR experience. <br/><br/>VRMark includes two benchmark tests that run on your desktop monitor, no headset required. Or connect an HMD and see for yourself with the free-roaming Experience mode.<br/><br/><strong>Orange Room benchmark</strong><br/><br/>The VRMark Orange Room benchmark shows the impressive level of detail that can be achieved on a PC that meets the recommended minimum hardware requirements for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. If your PC passes this test, it's ready for the two most popular VR systems available today.<br/><br/><strong>Blue Room benchmark</strong><br/><br/>The Blue Room is a much more demanding test, ideal for benchmarking the latest graphics cards. With its massive 5K rendering resolution and spectacular volumetric lighting effects, the Blue Room sets the bar for future hardware generations.<br/><br/><strong>Results and reporting</strong><br/><br/>After running each test, you'll see clearly whether your PC has passed or not. You'll get an overall score for your PC, which you can use to compare systems, and detailed charts showing how your PC performed during the test.<br/><br/><strong>Experience mode</strong><br/><br/>VR headsets use clever techniques to compensate for missed frames. With Experience mode, you can judge the quality of the VR experience with your own eyes. Explore each scene in your own time in VR or on your monitor.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-19T01:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/176/1760e5d5e859714441ed1e9c5f1e0cac.jpg", "website": "http://www.futuremark.com/benchmarks/vrmark", "rating": 2.88, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 270, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuremark"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Futuremark"], "esrb_rating": null}
