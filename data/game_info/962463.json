And once misfortune struck, it struck hard. In an instant, the days of living large in the prestigious high-rises were gone. \n<br/>\nLooks like you need to go back to doing what you know best - bouncing the door at your old job in the Green Door club. Seems that, much like you, the club has nowhere to go but up, and so it\u2019s time to bring it back to its former glory. \n<br/>\nGET. TO. WORK.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n  THE BANTERAs the keeper of the gate, you must use your wits and quick thinking to turn away unwanted guests and maintain the club's reputation. Each guest comes with their own unique personality and backstory, and you must assess their worthiness based on a range of factors, including dress code, behavior, and attitude. Remember - no blue jeans!\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you decide someone doesn\u2019t make the cut comes your time to shine!\n<br/>\nDeliver your most clever quips and insults, exploit every weakness you find and deliver a lyrical smackdown that will send them crying for mommy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n  THE VENUETechno Banter\u2019s visuals and sounds capture the essence of the Berlin techno clubbing scene, with bright neons, heavy bass, and an otherworldly vibe. The inspirations drawn heavily from the real world are twisted into something more surreal and will stun you as you navigate the bustling Green Door club and the famed Rainbow Drive in which it resides. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe residents of the area are exactly what you would expect from such a district, and more. Meet the geeks and freaks of Rainbow Drive and learn their wicked backstories, until finally you realise you might be exactly the right person in the right place.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n  THE LINEUPWho would be better suited to fill the Green Door club with heavy, techno beats, than real-life DJs rooted in the Berlin techno scene? Each day and each party is accentuated by deep house tracks that burrow in your ear and instantly transport you to the raw, underground basements where the beat is law and the BPMs flow freely.\n<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T04:09:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1f729a29608866e1aec250cc8ac1af9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 332, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dexai Arts"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Crunching Koalas"], "esrb_rating": null}
