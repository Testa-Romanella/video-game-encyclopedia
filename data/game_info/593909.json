You can dig deeper down and may just find yourself some ore which in turn will help you along a path of linear progression</p>\n<p>Everything that is working and shown in this prototype\u00a0is still a work in progress and everything is subject to change, please leave me any bug reports / suggestions in either the comments below of this game or my discord provided. Or, if you're pretty savvy with Construct you can send me a direct message over discord (siegeholm#2804) and work out some things left on my to-do list. Overall I really\u00a0hope you enjoy my first prototype!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00b/00b69a70a25c427df9f1f001fede47c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["siegeholm"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
