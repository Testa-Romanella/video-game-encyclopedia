{"id": 634341, "slug": "the-ritual-spinfoam-games", "name": "The Ritual (Spinfoam Games)", "name_original": "The Ritual (Spinfoam Games)", "description": "<p>Although inspired by the Pompous Trash game jam I'm not entirely sure this project is going to wind up fitting in there.</p><p>The title screen contains the following block of text, which I think it is worth reproducing here as a description of the game itself and a sort of warning about the sort of project it is:</p>This game was motivated by the Pompous Trash game jam  which very much set the tone in my mind as I was developing it. It is  also lightly inspired by the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode  titled \"Darmok\",  although it more or less discards the conclusion of that episode and  instead stops at the idea of impossible communication and mutually  meaningless language.\r\n\r\nIt is unapologetically opaque and does not  concern itself with being a reasonable gaming experience. The contents  of the titular ritual do not coalesce into a story. The game makes no  particular effort to motivate you to complete it. It is not an  incremental game; its mechanics do not expand or unfold.\r\n\r\nThe goal  of the game is to perform the ritual completely and correctly. The  ritual itself more or less takes the form of a call and response  exercise; if you select the correct response for each prompt in the  ritual you will succeed.\r\n\r\nThe practice mode will allow you to  experiment with individual parts of the ritual and displays some  additional information which you may find valuable.\r\n\r\nIf you decide  to invest time in The Ritual, you may find it useful to work together  with others. You should also be aware that the game does not save your  progress in \"Perform the Ritual\" mode, so you must complete the entire  ritual in a single session.\r\n<p>There are some other things I would like to do with this idea, but it is so niche that I'm not sure it is going to be worthwhile to pile more time into it. (Maybe if it gets some traction?) If you happen across any bugs, please do let me know about them and I'll try to get them fixed up -- but beyond that I'm not sure if there will be further development or not.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T06:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5a/c5a61cc5c815398b5b0e03b66d3ff980.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spinfoam Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
