During the summer she is working long hours as a cleaner / 'maid' and this time she is working in the dormitories where all the wealthy kids are.<br/>Doesn't like the job she has for most of the year but doesn't mind cleaning, however she wouldn't be able to support herself if she had to work full time just to pay rent and study, etc.<br/>Has a blog that blew up on the internet but doesn't earn her any money. She just wants to survive summer, but these boys have different ideas!<br/><br/><strong>Matthew White</strong><br/>Is already a pretty famous football player and comes from a wealthy family, so he's used to getting what he wants.<br/>This, weirdly enough, made him a little naive, goofy but has a huge heart.
