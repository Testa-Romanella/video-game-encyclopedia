Demoscene also served as a source of inspiration for the developers.</p>\n<p>The main feature that the game revolves around is the procedural generation. Each planet you visit is generated from scratch. The information about the planets and their inhabitants is dynamically updated so every player can discover a new species or planet and give it a name.</p>\n<p>No Man&#39;s Sky gameplay implies the exploration of space and planets some of which are inhabited with extra-terrestrial life, gathering resources, space battles, maintaining and upgrading the player&#39;s ship and completing bounty hunting missions. The main objective is to reach the center of the galaxy. </p>\n<p>On release, it was stated that the game is in fact multiplayer, but the size of its world is so big that the probability of meeting another player is extremely small. It turned out that it is impossible to meet any other player due to the extremely limited multiplayer aspect. As of 2018, Hello Games released the fourth major update which included the full multiplayer experience.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2016-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T07:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/174/1743b3dd185bda4a7be349347d4064df.jpg", "website": "http://www.no-mans-sky.com", "rating": 3.7, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 299, "owned": 5383, "beaten": 294, "toplay": 321, "dropped": 984, "playing": 294}, "playtime": 14, "achievements_count": 166, "ratings_count": 1497, "suggestions_count": 751, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1509, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["Hello Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hello Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
