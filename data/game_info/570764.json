By a</p>\n<p>stroke of luck he has the opportunity to gather a decent amount of cash.</p>\n<p>Usually farm animals don't know the value of money. This is where you come</p>\n<p>in. Help Francis to bring home the bacon, and catch all the twenty-dollar</p>\n<p>bills, which for some reason are blowing in the wind.</p>\n<p>You do this by pressing:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- \"Q\" to stretch his arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- \"A\" to retract his arm.</p>\n<p>Every time you catch a banknote, Francis will move to the right, making it</p>\n<p>harder to catch the next one.</p>\n<p>If you fail to catch a note, you will lose the game.</p>\n<p>However, if you manage to catch twenty banknotes, you will win.</p>\n<p>Unlike games that are in an infinite loop, where you just score points</p>\n<p>until you die, this game actually has a victory condition.</p>\n<p>This means you can win and feel really proud of what you have accomplished!</p>\n<p>--- Code Explanation ---</p>\n<p>Line 0: Read the data for the partial pig string, the paper money string</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and the victory text string.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Make a string with quotation marks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Use this string to complete the pig string.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In a loop, create the background string, which also doubles as a</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 vertical orientation string.</p>\n<p>Line 1: In this same loop, create the partial arm string.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Complete the arm string with a hoof string.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the background colour to black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the arm length variable.</p>\n<p>Line 2: Clear the screen, display the dollar amount, the background and</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the pig.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Randomly set the variable of the paper money altitude.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the variable for the horizontal position of the paper money</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 to the far right.</p>\n<p>Line 3: Display the arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Read the keyboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the key pressed was \"Q\" and the arm is not fully stretched,</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 then stretch the arm.</p>\n<p>Line 4: If the key pressed was \"A\" and the arm is not fully retracted,</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 then retract the arm.</p>\n<p>Line 5: Display the paper money.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Move the paper money to the left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the money has reached the far left side of the screen, then</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 delete the victory text and jump to line 8.</p>\n<p>Line 6: If the character in the position just in front of the paper money</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is NOT a pig's hoof, then jump to line 3.</p>\n<p>Line 7: Display the \"OINK\" text balloon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Wait a short while.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Move the pig to the right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the pig has NOT yet reached the final position, then jump to</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 line 2.</p>\n<p>Line 8: Clear the screen, display the dollar amount, the \"GAME OVER\" text</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and the victory text (should this be the case).</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Wait for a key to be pressed.</p>\n<p>Line 9: Restart the game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This line also contains data for the partial pig string, the paper</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 money string and the victory text string.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T06:42:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a35/a352185926469207b6e8eadcab3596d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
