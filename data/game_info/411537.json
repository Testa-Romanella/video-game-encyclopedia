Gathering all their courage, they venture through the woods, into the village, and into uncharted territory to find what they need to treat their illness. </em><br/></p>\n<p>Made for <strong>My First Game Jam: Winter 2020</strong>, following the theme <strong>cold. </strong>Made in roughly 7-8 days, and my biggest game yet. I implemented several mechanics and skills (a lot of this happens in the coding end) that I hadn't tried before.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a sequel to Reverie and uses the same characters, though no knowledge of it is needed to play and enjoy this game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Left and right to move. Up to jump. Press up again while in the air to double jump. When wearing winter cloak, press down to crouch/sit.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN GLITCHES I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIX:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- Occasionally the character's sprite will get stuck on a sprite it's not supposed to be on, though you can still move and it will fix itself.<br/>- Some interactable button prompts don't disappear when you trigger the associated action.</p>\n<p><strong>NOT A GLITCH BUT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT'S ONE:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- There is no sound! I tried. It didn't go well.</p>\n<p>For fitting music, you might want to play this song.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Changelog:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Slightly tweaked visuals and collision for some rooms to make pathing a bit more obvious.</p><p><strong>To do:<br/></strong></p><p>Add an opening cutscene/more dialogue.<br/></p><p>Fix the timing/code on the ending cutscene.</p><p>Add guidance for controls.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL MENTIONS AND THANKS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Some of the backgrounds for these areas were kindly provided by Cardi, Bay and Ginger. A huge thanks - I might not have been able to complete the game on time without them!<br/></p>\n<p>Some of the NPC designs (and characters) were provided by Bay, Arrows, and Cayde. You can see some of these characters idling around in the village. Some didn't make it in since I had to trim some assets for time.</p>\n<p>A very special thank you to all my friends on various social media sites, who watched me slowly descend into madness over the course of making this game. You're all stellar for putting up with me and my increasingly manic commentary.</p>\n<p>And thank<em> you</em> for taking the time to play this game! I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p><strong>CHARACTER INFORMATION:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A pair of mute siblings who share a bond stronger than words. <br/>J\u00ec (\u8bb0) means 'to record/to note/to memorise'.<br/>Y\u00ec (\u5fc6) means 'to recollect/to remember'.</p>\n<p>Together, their names combine to form <strong>j\u00ecy\u00ec</strong> (\u8bb0\u5fc6), \"memory\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c87/c87c5e8a20df750c53cb5901d0ffcdb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ruka"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
