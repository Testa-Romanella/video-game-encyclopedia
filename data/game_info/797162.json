It's multiplayer <strong><em>ONLY</em></strong>, so you must have at least 2 players in order play (sorry!). It uses Unity's new Input system and so it should support most controllers (and one of you could use a Keyboard).</p>\n<p>Anyway, to the good stuff...</p>\r\n\"In this <strong>game</strong>, death is only the beginning...\u00a0You must <strong><em>die</em></strong>, then <em>hunt</em>!\"\r\n<p>The idea of this game is to collect an Ancient Relic, which causes you to die and become a vengeful spirit. You then, have a limited time to hunt down the rest of the players before turning back to normal. The player with the highest points at the end of the match - wins!</p>\n<p>If you can outrun the ghost however, you'll gain <strong>HUGE </strong>points. So the choice is yours...</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it. Please let me know your thoughts :) <strong><em>Feel free to check out the trailer for some gameplay footage!!</em></strong></p>\n<p>I kind of ran out of time towards the end, and so I had to slap together a pretty rushed stage, along with a lack of real polish. A lesson to be learnt for next time.</p>\n\r\nHere are a list of some of the Assets I used;\r\n<p>Synty Studios POLYGON Starter Pack.</p>\n<p>Lowpoly Ghost - Codewart Game Assets</p>\n<p>Fantasy Skybox - Render Knight</p>\n<p>Basic Emotions - Kevin Iglesias</p>\n<p>(There are a few other Assets in the source code, but I didn't end up using them).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T18:31:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c6/0c6ea5180b3dff765eb5248a1b04e71e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ByteSizePlay"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
