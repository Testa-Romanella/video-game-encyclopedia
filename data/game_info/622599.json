And every move you make makes your next move even harder...<br/>In this world you are going to fall. And then die. And then fall again. Faster.<h3>Gameplay</h3>This game is a reversed platformer. In the sense that your goal is not to jump on platforms, but to avoid them. <br/>You are going to fall down. How deep? Depends on your decisions. How fast? Depends on your actions.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Your every action increases falling speed. So, moving much makes further actions harder<br/></li><li> Platforms can move, change form, appear and disappear, fall from above, follow you, etc<br/></li><li> Character can charge before making a move. The more precise charging was, the less additional moves you have to make to avoid next obstacle</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T03:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c07/c07421ca890e9b422ff6ec53ff1ff64d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fiery Bytes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fiery Bytes"], "esrb_rating": null}
