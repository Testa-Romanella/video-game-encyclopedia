The player has 10 seconds before the new wave spawns. They can take advantage of this delay to find health packs, ammo etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to reach the 15th wave of enemies and defeat the last boss.Of course the game will allow unlimited game play after victory.<br/><br/>As other objectives that could help the player to accomplish the first, Special \"rooms\" are available that have inside 2 or more health packs and weapons for a quick restock.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the game natively supports VR headsets like the Oculus Rift, we're making sure the game is as immersive as possible, motion sickness free and comfortable.
