Originally an experimental game, it became 1 game in Japan. Locally cooperative, globally competitive. Play alone or with your friends -- as a team! -- to compete against scores from other single player and multiplayer teams.<br/><br/>The most fundamental and philosophically pure shoot 'em up ever. Truly tests how good you are at dodging and shooting enemies.<br/><br/>Empower the player philosophy. Increased challenge comes from increased game difficulty not player weakness. Allows domination. No gimmicks. No hidden points or bonuses. To get the highest score, dominate the game.<br/><br/>1-4 Players<br/>Team Play<br/>60FPS<br/>1-8 Fighters<br/>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br/>DUAL PLAY (control 2 fighters at once)<br/>BOSS RUSH<br/>Dragon Music OST<br/><br/>1-4 players<br/>10MB minimum save size<br/>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br/>720p HD Video Output<br/>Offline Play Enabled<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
