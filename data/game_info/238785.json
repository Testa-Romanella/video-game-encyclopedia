The only way how to cross the borders to the other side is to win in a TV reality show organised by the regime.<br />\nGameplay mechanics address the themes like groupthink, obedience to authority, fake news or immigration. They are based on the interactions between the elements and characters in the game and the main character is the driving force behind these interactions.<br />\nSarcasm, inappropriate jokes and absurdity of the system game is set in plays a strong role during the game story development. We are playing with some alternative reality through recognisable elements of todays political and social scene. We are becoming global by building walls in between ourselves.
