{"id": 708544, "slug": "one-shot-dungeon", "name": "One Shot Dungeon", "name_original": "One Shot Dungeon", "description": "<p>The forsaken tower has trapped you up on the highest floor for many days now, equipped with only a crossbow and one arrow you must solve trajectory-based puzzles and escape each room within 10 seconds. Are you fast enough? Willing enough, for the challenges ahead? You must escape at all cost, for your life depends on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made as part of\u00a0a week-long game jam at university with the prompt being \"only 10 seconds\" and having a\u00a0fixed camera. The game is buggy and lacking in levels but hopefully, we will add to it over time! Big congrats to all the other teams on making great games!</p>\n<ul><li>Coding - Simon, Alfie\u00a0</li><li>Animated 2D art - Joel, Josh</li><li>2D art - Joel, Alex, Josh</li><li>UI Design - L.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T13:49:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6db0d9001a4d275c2edb0d001f0e6517.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JoelT"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
