You wield a sword that is entirely controllable with the mouse and its buttons, allowing an infinite number of different attacks. Moreover, it is possible to defend yourself against enemy attacks coming from all sides. There are few keys, but the controls are quite complex and not necessarily very intuitive; that's why MUSASHI could offer an exciting e-sport with mechanics that have never been seen until now.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><em>ZQSD to move</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Right click</strong> to hold the sword's guard</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Right click and Left click</strong> to attack</em></p>\n\n\n<p>I hope you like it. <br/></p>\n<p>All feedbacks are welcome\ud83e\udd1e</p>\n<p>This prototype might be a little bit laggy and CPU hungry<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T14:34:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee0/ee0b21c061efc426eb578b4fd9fdc059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Waykzen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
