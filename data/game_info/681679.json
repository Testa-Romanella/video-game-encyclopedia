Anyway my first modification was changing the space ship to a pirate ship, you now have to sail through the water killing aliens until finally the final boss, the Kraken appears. My second modification was what I\u00a0did with the User Interface, I changed the font and colorway of the interface and overall I think it just made it a bit easier on the eyes. Lastly I edited the Straightshooter so that it evolved into a harder mob and I also edited it to look alot cooler. Hope you enjoy my project!</p>\n\n<p>Created by Nick Falcone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:12:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31e/31eb1fc6b81ca6c86c0b4c4cba59265c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["nfalcone"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
