The story is linear, unavoidable and (hopefully) thought-provoking. You experience his perceptions, fall under the consequences of his decisions, and meet everyone who didn't change him.</p>\n<p>Reviews: Kotaku, RPS, Indiestatik - more available via http://www.actualsunlight.com</p>\n<p>Due to explicit language, Actual Sunlight is not appropriate for players under the age of 18.</p>\n<p>It also deals with <strong>extremely mature themes</strong>, including <strong>depression</strong> and <strong>thoughts of suicide</strong>. Similar to other forms of art that tackle these issues, Actual Sunlight can be an extremely powerful emotional experience \u2013 before downloading it, please first consider what your reaction to a book, film or piece of music in a similar vein might be.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/431c793b17c82511ff9e3f25c795ea59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Will O'Neill"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
