With the help of power-ups, you can hamper the opponent or get the upper hand. If you are up for it you can also drown your opponent, make him return to his base.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Design by Tom\u00e1s Longo</p>\n<p>Art by Joana Marques</p>\n<p>Code by Lu\u00eds Chaves</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:27:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/057/0570904fa8b400424f69f19bb0268ea2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TomasLongo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
