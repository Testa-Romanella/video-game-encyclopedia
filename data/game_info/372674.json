Collect coins to gain jumps, and use them wisely to reach the end of each level. Every leap will require focus and precision to avoid a variety of enemies and fire.<br/><br/>This is a hardcore test of old-school platforming skill that doesn't hold back its punches. As you face each and every new challenge, you'll find yourself pushing your limits to get to the goal as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Prepare for diabolical challenges, blistered fingers, and for your mettle to be truly tested. Do you have what it takes to conquer every level?<br/><br/>Leap, fall, and perish \u2014 over and over again. Only the most seasoned platforming veterans will overcome the trials that <strong>leapoid</strong> has to offer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T03:27:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38cf5a46bb2f40356b090bf67748bacf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Topher Anselmo"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Topher Anselmo"], "esrb_rating": null}
