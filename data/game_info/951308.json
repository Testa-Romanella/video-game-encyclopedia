The objective of the game is to guess the mystery word by guessing food-related words. You have six attempts to guess the word correctly. The words must relate to food, so be sure to keep that in mind when making your guesses. To make a guess, simply type a word and press enter. If the letter is in the mystery word, it will be highlighted in yellow or green if it is in the correct position. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the mystery word or run out of attempts. Good luck and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T20:32:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/506/50640dd24daa87459d650466066be5b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Studio Latte"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
