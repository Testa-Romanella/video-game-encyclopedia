You have a limited time to destroy as many enemy planes as you can. Reaching certain scores gives you additional time.\u00a0Every time you fire, your plane is sent flying in the opposite direction. Use your bullets and your plane itself to defeat as many enemies as you can. Destroying multiple planes with one shot adds a point multiplier. Share your high score in the comments!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<ul><li>Menu: Mouse</li><li>Shoot:\u00a0Spacebar</li></ul>\n<p>This is my entry\u00a0\u00a0into the Kenney Jam 2021, theme:\u00a0ROTATION. This was my first game jam and although it was stressful at first coming up with an idea, it was a lot of fun and a great learning experience. There are a lot of features I have in mind for this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Sprites, sound effects: Kenney</li><li>Menu Theme:\u00a0FinalGateStudios</li><li>Main Background Music:\u00a0Tallbeard Studios</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T15:38:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51e/51e76aa1a4983312b5c40cbf3304b369.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Bronto Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
