It's tribute game in more ways than one.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst off, it's a tribute to Space Invaders Extreme that originally appeared on the Nintendo DS. It was Space Invaders kicked up a notch with a total sensory overload. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSecond, it's a tribute and thank you to all the great little carts coming out of the Pico-8 forum. In particular, Invader Overload uses several of the carts from the \r\n\t\t\t\t\tTweetJam thread as manic backgrounds. Designs from zep, NuSan, kometbomb and others are included and create one hell of a show.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere were so many cool little demos coming out of the TweetJam thread that I just needed to find a way to use them. I consider Invader Overload a sort of TweetJam jukebox and hopefully we can all expand on it because \r\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>you can totally add your own background!</strong> There's plenty of room left on the cart so give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis cart also features some great music from Brian Follick, aka, @gnarcade_vgm. He made a great music track specifically for this game along with a few sound effects, and without that collaboration, this game would have fallen completely flat. \r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tCredits\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Code &amp; art: Brian Vaughn</li>\n<li>Music: Brian Follick</li>\n<li>Animations: The Pico-8 Community</li>\n</ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tTry these other games\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Invader Overload</li>\n<li>BuzzKill</li>\n<li>Bustin'</li>\n<li>Bullet Cave</li>\n<li>Mass360</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29a/29ad9600b43cb8f41f384c3d26bcf5eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Morning Toast"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
