This game in the cyberpunk style will require composure and will really challenge your brain. <br/>\r\nTry closing all cells in this scheme. Alas, it's not a walk in the park. Steel doors open just once. One wrong step and there will be skulls instead of silver flowers on this field. Each turn requires a well thought-through decision. Don't rush - the passage can open in any direction. Breathe, think, and your energy will turn into a key to these locks. Only a cool mind will be able to beat the game!<br/>\r\nAttention! All levels can be completed, but if you are desperate, you can use some cheats: move an energy cell, drop a stone or use a hint.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 All levels can be completed!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Cool graphics!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Mesmerizing music!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Tips and hints!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOpen all doors on this field!
