This one features 3 different Dawww sound effects, 4 different rolling cutscenes, a new minigame called Find the Dice based on All 20s Episode 100, a credits page, and some general polishing to the whole experience. I hope you enjoy and remember to download the Windows Application for the superior sound experience(HTML hates audio for some reason).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:48:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3ee3df39baf57aa85a6e0928cea3569.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["plexagon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
