The theme was \"Web\" and the limitation was \"there is no ground\". That gave me the idea of making the no internet game, but IN SPACE!!! So you float around the centre of the screen and can change gravity to dodge asteroids.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I have a bunch of uni assignments due, I just saw this and thought it'd be a nice quick game I could make as a break. But that also meant I didn't have much time to work on it, so it's not the most polished or even complete game, but I like how colourful I managed to make it :D</p>\n<p>All of the sounds were either recorded in Audacity with my voice, or made in Bosca Ceoil and edited in Audacity.</p>\n<p>All of the art was made in Aseprite.</p>\n<p>Everything was made within the 72 hour period, including one of the fonts, because I thought that'd be a fun idea (it wasn't).</p>\n<p>Hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T19:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e01c2d731ecf7d57569ecbaf723a535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anogrm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
