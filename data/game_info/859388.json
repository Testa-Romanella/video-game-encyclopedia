Brew hot beverages for your clients by clicking and dragging the ingredients to the correct cookware. You can add the ingredients to the cup in any order. To cook an ingredient, drop it into the appropiate cookware and click and hold your mouse over it.\u00a0You can cook any number of ingredients in the same cookware simultaneously (if you need one hot milk and one hot chocolate, you can drop them both in the cooking pot and cook them at the same time). You can't do this in the mixing cup, however. It can only take one milk and one spice at a time.<br/><br/>I recommend you play on fullscreen, I couldn't get the viewport correctly set up lol.
