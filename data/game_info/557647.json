I didn't originally plan on participating this week, but was inspired after playing through this level early Sunday morning.<br/></p>\n<p>The original level is difficult, requiring players to jump their mine carts over a variety of fast-approaching obstacles including broken down mine carts, incoming carts containing kremlings, and holes in the track. Both Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong can ride in the carts, although Diddy Kong has been cut from this version as his red hat pushed the number of colours on-screen at any given time over the limit.</p>\n<p>For your gaming displeasure:</p>\n<ul><li>Levels are randomly generated</li><li>Enemies are erratic</li><li>Hit-boxes are broken</li><li>There is no sound</li></ul>\n<p>Some of these things are due to laziness on my part, and some of them are to emulate the feeling of consistently failing to clear levels in DKC at 4 in the morning.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T10:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de6/de6091762fa27b7156743002625732cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["_peanutButter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
