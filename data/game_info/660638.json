A solo RPG.</p>\n<p><em>Guillotine Earrings</em> is a magical journalling game on two pages. Your character is a jeweller living in a city on the brink of revolution, held in the grip of a cruel and despotic tyrant.\u00a0 Over the course of the game, you describe and draw the jewellery they make as they attempt to fan the flames of protest in the city with their art. You also describe the parties they attend, the allies they find, and the communities they enlist as they start a revolution behind the unlikely barricade of their storefront.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Guillotine Earrings</em> has players roll dice to make jewellery and network with people. They must record and describe both their successes and their failures. It's a flexible game which has two alternative timelines: one which is simple, structured and short; the other which is more experimental, and allows for a longer, more unpredictable game. It's up to you to decide which you prefer - or to play the game more than once, creating different people in different cities as they try to rise up against their oppressors.<br/></p>\n<p>You will need:</p>\n<ul><li>2 D12s</li><li>A Jenga Tower OR a Pool of Jewellery (Optional)</li></ul>\n<p>Layout and formatting by Max Briar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T18:57:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/113c304d96f1c1270b4a8138bcb939e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ella Watts"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
