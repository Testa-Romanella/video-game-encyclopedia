This is a free PC version all zipped up for you to download and play. This is a work in progress test game, (ads are not activated yet, so it's totally free to play.)</p>\n<p>Download the file: <strong>Remillard-PC.zip </strong>&gt;\u00a0<em>right click</em> and unzip it.</p>\n<p>Open 2 folders: Remillard-PC &gt; win32exe</p>\n<p>Scroll down and\u00a0double click the file: <strong>Remillard.exe</strong></p>\n<p>Screen opens a little too square.\u00a0Adjust screen so it is a long phone shaped rectangle and everything will look OK.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Your rocket buggy rolls forward on its own.\u00a0 You can JUMP (space bar) or you can SHOOT (tap the period button on your keyboard). Shoot alien monsters, and try to collect enough cards to unlock advanced levels with many more creatures to battle.</p>\n<p>Everything works except the ads, so the WATCH reward video button will not trigger. Other than that, the game is playable for testing. Feel free to give me any ideas you get and I'll see if I can work them into the final version for iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Art by: Michael Remillard, Music by: Mark Harvey, Game by: J.E.Moores</p>\n<p>Stay warm and be cool.</p>\n<p>Jay from: JEMoores.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T02:40:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba7/ba77861f178f26808bd64327398c7952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JEMoores"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
