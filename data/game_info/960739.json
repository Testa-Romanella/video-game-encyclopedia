Oh no, you must be lost, like the warriors who are forever trapped in the dark tower.<br/><br/><h3> Game background </h3></li><li> This is an ancient story in which you play the role of a warrior who breaks into a demon tower and is ordered by a king to try to reach the top of the dark tower to defeat the demon king and save the princess, but you will find that there is more to it than that; In the game, players will collect items, uncover mysteries, destroy monsters, dig for buried treasures in the magic tower, and explore a constantly changing dark tower trapped at the end of time in a cycle of killing and exploration</li></ul><h3> Game mechanics </h3><ul><li> Bomb-man mechanic: In the game, you play as a warrior who can plant bombs to destroy monsters and clear obstacles along the way; Different from the traditional Bomberman mechanic, players can use the gold collected in the Dark Tower to continuously strengthen and give bombs special properties (and even change the original explosion mechanism of the bomb), the game also retains the classic Bomberman basic attributes (blast distance and number of bombs can be placed at one time).<br/></li><li> Arena Shooting: Players will have a ghost pistol that can kill alien monsters. While players use bombs to fight real world monsters in the tower, alien monsters will come from all sides to try to kill the player, but killing these monsters will gradually restore lost health </li></ul>.<br/><h3> Game features </h3><ul><li> New 3D: Although the game is a top-down view, the game uses a completely new 3D, dark style, and the in-game camera will follow the player and make the appropriate 3D rotation based on the player's movement, allowing the player to focus on the in-game scene<br/></li><li> Maze Exploration &amp; Procedural generation: In the game, players can explore every corner of every layer of the Magic Tower, solve the puzzles in the tower and collect any items that can make the character stronger. Every area players explore will be generated by the program, without any possibility of repetition; There is no clear play requirements and linear flow in the game, players can explore the unknown corners and corners of the magic tower according to their preferences in the game, and constantly discover new surprises<br/></li><li> Castlevania: The in-game portion of the scene includes ability locks and loop exploration mechanics<br/></li><li> No death Penalty: Players will not lose any attributes or skills gained after they die. Players do not need to worry about the death penalty of losing progress and losing the desire to explore the maze. They just need to keep the original mentality of casual games and go to the deepest part of the Dark Tower. However, specific progress may be lost in specific, Rouguelike mechanic scenarios<br/></li><li> One-blood mechanic: Combat has no numerical mechanic, and all monsters in the game die immediately after taking damage (some special monsters may trigger special effects), which means that if you're nimble enough, you can get through the game without having to rely on item bonuses, which is consistent with the difficulty setting of Rouguelike</li></ul><h3> Developer's words </h3><ul><li> I am a student affiliated to the virtual reality training base. Out of my love for maze puzzle games and ability training of Unity3D engine, I made such a game. I'm not particularly good at game design myself, and I know it's a big challenge for me; During the process of production, I learned from many successful examples, such as Black Emperor, Dead Cell, Blue, and Super Bomber R, referring to these successful developers' unique understanding of game mechanics design. I am very happy that I can learn a lot from this process. There should still be some problems in my game. If these problems cause you trouble during the game, I am very sorry for this. I will constantly improve all the problems in the game and inject more new content </li></ul> in the follow-up learning process.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-15T02:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb1/fb13c48e28f995bb402463a2b29a04f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u667a\u79d11902\u73ed \u4e54\u5143\u6210"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u667a\u79d11902\u73ed \u4e54\u5143\u6210"], "esrb_rating": null}
