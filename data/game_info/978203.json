{"id": 978203, "slug": "gravity-pro", "name": "Gravity Pro", "name_original": "Gravity Pro", "description": "Drawing inspiration from the iconic arcade classics of the 1980s, this game puts a fresh spin on the beloved paddle-and-ball genre. Unlike traditional games where the ball moves on its own, here, the dynamics are intriguingly different. The ball's motion is entirely governed by gravity and the impact of your paddle strikes. As a player, your task is to skillfully manage the paddle at the screen's bottom, orchestrating the ball's trajectory with precision. The challenge lies in striking the ball in just the right way, navigating it towards your targets with a blend of strategy and reflexes. This game invites you to revisit a nostalgic era with a modern twist, where your actions directly influence the ball's path in a dance of gravity and momentum.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour skill won't go unnoticed by other players. Every match you complete, whether successful or not, is scored and recorded in the Leaderboard, which is displayed after each level. This feature not only tracks your progress but also showcases your achievements and gameplay style to the entire gaming community.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdditional Features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Multiplayer Mode: Invite one or two additional players to join the game for cooperative action.
