It's the first time I've ever done something like this so I apologies for any errors. This project was both a lot of fun to work on and the biggest pain in the ass. I had a lot of things I wanted to do and I had a lot of problems. Overall though, I'm happy I was able to complete my first game. And to all of you who play it, thank you, and I hope you like it! <br/></p>\n<p>-Heather Baer <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T02:27:39", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["baerheather"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
