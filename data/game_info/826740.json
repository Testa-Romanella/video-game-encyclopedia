Each level is hand-crafted and play-tested to challenging and delightful perfection.  Half Chicken, half-pinball, Poulet can beak-smash foes and bounce off of them, flying towards the next foe for a score-multiplying combo (or maybe to an untimely end!)  <br/><br/>Victory awaits at the end of 32 (or more?) 2D stages across 8 worlds just like the platformer classics of back in the day.  Set high scores, set speed-run records, and maybe discover a secret or two.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T03:31:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac0/ac04f5238f023ee066e92bdeb47a0f41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["R/T Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["R/T Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
