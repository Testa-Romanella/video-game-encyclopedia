Someone to save, something to fix; a <em>key</em> to place into a <em>lock</em>. Only, you aren't told where to go or what to do.  </p>\n<p>You must determine that path for yourself.<br/></p>\n<p>\n<strong>The World</strong> is alive and breathing.</p>\n<p>Every character has their own story to tell... and their own<strong> fate</strong>. You can choose to fight them, help them, or move on. The result for each is unique. <br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey all have something.  A misstep. A shortcoming. </p>\n<p>Something, somewhere, sometime; they all slip up.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNo one's perfect.  No one's innocent. </p>\n<p> And <em>not everything is as it seems.<br/></em></p>\n<p>It's up to you to repair the broken timeline and save them all.<strong> <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Or not. </strong></p>\n<p><em>For <strong>that</strong> is your choice.  And that it will remain.</em><br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe hope to see you soon, and thanks for the support!Please note that this is a demo, and in early-access, so there are bound to be bugs! The Demo contains the first Chapter of the game, 'Chapter 0', and is still subject to change.
