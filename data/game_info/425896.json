Bubbles combine to give a numbered tile with the highest power of two &lt;= the number of bubbles. The numbered tile replaces the bubble clicked. Numbered tiles combine similarly. The score is the total on the numbered tiles * the multiplier - the number of unpopped bubbles. The multiplier is determined by the value of the highest numbered tile. Positive scores are good!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Code: Huw Lloyd (C++ / SFML)</p>\n<p>Music: WIll Lloyd</p>\n<p>Assets: <em>Round Pop</em> font by Gamorice (fontspace.org), bubble pop sound by TheBuilder15 (freesound.org) Billiard ball textures by GameArtForge (opengameart.org)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/924ad6ea47bc4b233478670c86b6d962.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hml"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
