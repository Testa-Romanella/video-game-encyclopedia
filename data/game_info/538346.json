Explore the castle's puzzles and stories in order to find a way to ascend.</p>\n<p>This project is currently in early development and is still finding its way. Playing and giving feedback will help me achieve the best version of what I want to create.</p>\n<p>I envision a cozy, whimsical, morbid world where you'll navigate through puzzles and explore the strange corners of a castle.</p>\n<p>So far I've been focusing on finding an art style and getting some mechanics in place. The demo is rather linear and simplistic, but I hope you can envision what's to come.</p>\n<p>If you enjoy the experience I hope you may consider donating. Even a little helps a huge deal and would encourage me immensely!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>\n<strong>Controller:</strong><br/>\r\nA: movement boost<br/>\r\nR1: grab object<br/>\r\nLeft joy: movement\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keyboard:</strong><br/>\r\nArrow keys to move<br/>\r\nCtrl: grab<br/>\r\nShift: movement boost<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34fda75d4b758473e6e581f38a45a196.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toonspex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
