The next thing you know you have turned into a slime!</p>\n<p>After this you go further into the forest, but are met with more slimes! They start to steal the slime from your body! Shoot the slimes with your own slime, and then collect the slime particles that the enemies drop.</p>\r\nDon't stop collecting the particles, or you will end up as a pile of mush.\r\n<em>Controls</em>\n<p><strong>Move - WASD or Arrow Keys</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim - Move mouse around player</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Shoot - Left click</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28a/28a1e80d8c8617f841bc31dc5355af63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["LlamaDev Games", "llamaking"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
