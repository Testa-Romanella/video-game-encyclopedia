{"id": 972950, "slug": "lose-ctrl", "name": "Lose Ctrl", "name_original": "Lose Ctrl", "description": "<strong>Lose Ctrl is a collection of minigames with constantly changing controls. Have fun and challenge your friends in a chaotic and weird multiplayer. Or dive deep into a singleplayer mode where minigames string together nicely, telling a dark-humored story about work-life.</strong><br/><br/><h3>MOVE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER MOVED BEFORE</h3>Seriously... The controls will be scrambled while playing the game and you will need to adapt. While this feels frustrating at first, theres a great sense of achievement once you have mastered your new reality. The only question is: Will you be able to come back to your normal controls after playing the game?<br/><br/><br/><h3>SINGLEPLAYER</h3>Lose Ctrl changes the way your keyboard and mouse works. The singleplayer uses this mechanic to make the player feel the weird reality of our main character, whose life slowly spirals out of control. You will slip into the (untied) shoes of Billy, whose only friend is a cute and sentient pet roomba called <strong>Tweepy</strong>. Together, you try to navigate a world that has stopped making sense. In a lot of ways, Lose Ctrl is a fun to play parody on the absurdity of modern (work)life.<br/><br/><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3>While the Singleplayer slowly ramps up the weirdness of your new controls, the multiplayer jumps right in. It is absolutely chaotic but in a good way (hopefully). Have you ever been in a car race and no one knows how to steer the car? Or have you worked on a collaborative excel sheet but everyone has suddenly forgotten how to use the keyboard and fails at writing the word Banana multiple times?<br/><br/><br/><h3>MINIGAMES AND LEVELS</h3>Here is a list of things you can do in Lose Ctrl:<br/><br/><ul><li> Drive to work (fast)<br/></li><li> Do the Energizer Dance (sweaty)<br/></li><li> Talk to your pet roomba Tweepy (&lt;3)<br/></li><li> Learn how to drive a segway (with helmet!)<br/></li><li> Drive a segway in office (without helmet?)<br/></li><li> Be in a meeting (buzzwords!)<br/></li><li> Shop groceries (crowded)<br/></li><li> Wait for the simulation to load (???)<br/></li><li> Make an appointment with your boss (because of your bad performance)<br/></li><li> Find your car in the garage (dark)<br/></li><li> Flee evil agents trying to catch you (exciting)<br/></li><li> Listen to the wonderfully curated in-game radio (Dj MONSTER)<br/></li><li> Become evil (evil)<br/></li><li> Dance at the office party (cool...)<br/></li><li> Click a button many times (easy)<br/></li><li> Chase a button that does not want to be clicked (hard)<br/></li><li> Grow physically and mentally by eating your dear Co-Workers (gross)<br/></li><li> ... and many more!</li></ul><h3>FINAL MESSAGE</h3><strong>Lose Ctrl</strong> is many things, but one thing it is not: predictable. Its mixture of challenging minigames, weird puzzles and an overarching narrative evades any classifyability. But fear not! It will all make sense in the end as the games development is supervised by <strong>CEO Martin Apple</strong>. His vision ensures the quality of the product.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T09:20:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7a/a7a2003eb11be3c9acbc84bac22e2f78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Play From Your Heart Ug"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Play From Your Heart Ug"], "esrb_rating": null}
