Aaron is faced with\u00a0 constant dilemma of not being good enough, as he gets constantly denied\u00a0 of climbing rank. Aaron, Winona and Blue all learn these ranks they have to climb hold more power then told.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hello everyone! Aari here. I'm really glad to be able to share my first project, It would mean the world if you could leave a comment or join my friend's discord server\u00a0https://discord.gg/W9HXCx7\u00a0Where we will\u00a0discuss and detail our game development.\u00a0 I have been meaning to share this project for about a year now, but working alone can be hard, but I really hope this experimental demo can at least slightly hint at what I'm going for. And huge apology for all if the grammatical errors, still learning :' ) I have much more planned for the game, but i need honest critiques to be able to shape my project, as looking at it from the same lense can hide the flaws. I also apologize for any bugs or errors, some i'm aware of, and it will take me longer to fix them, but if you find any, please leave them in my discord or comments, thank you!</p>\n<p>Credit:\u00a0</p><p>Royalty Free Alexander Nakarada = Music</p><p>Thebuzzpaper = Picture of space\u00a0</p><p>Adobe font\u00a0= Font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T04:07:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd3/bd3f616cb7d533b687833e18b069592b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aari-Bot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
