{"id": 17090, "slug": "dlc-quest", "name": "DLC Quest", "name_original": "DLC Quest", "description": "<h3>Have we gone too far?</h3>\n<p>The game was born deep down at Steam Greenlight and is ironizing about the DLC theme. The slogan of the game \u201cWhat happens when the DLC practices go too far?\u201d describes the main concept: there are more than 30 different DLC in the game, which open access to such things as character animation, the ability to move and so on. Each mechanic and every function that is considered a basic in an ordinary game here is hidden by an independent developer under the lock of additional content, which must be bought for the coins collected in the game. Perhaps the industry has gone too far in pursuit of profit and has forgotten what games are in the first place? The developer is trying to answer this question through the monotonous grind for abilities and power-ups.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The player takes control of the nameless protagonist, who must save the princess. The stereotypical story serves as the glue for a set of levels classics to the genre. The genre was selected suitably for such plot: DLC Quest is a 2D platformer. The game has two full story campaign: the original story of DLC Quest and the addition of Live Freemium or Die. Also, more than twenty achievements are available and an online leaderboard for comparing results with friends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:33:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/239/2395df3a388d30d09f5552a203ed8a7d.jpg", "website": "http://www.dlcquest.com", "rating": 3.39, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 25, "owned": 1188, "beaten": 167, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 33}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 198, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 200, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "macOS"], "developers": ["Going Loud Studios"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Going Loud Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
