In short, the game is split up into separate cases, each of which begins with a crime being committed, and each of which requires Twilight Sparkle to investigate, to talk to and confront various characters from the MLP:FiM universe, and to ultimately solve the puzzle and unravel the case. Currently there is only 1 case available and it is open source on GitHub.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-09T05:58:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4e970108ed428968409b1415e1d8234.jpg", "website": "http://www.equestriandreamers.com/mli", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
