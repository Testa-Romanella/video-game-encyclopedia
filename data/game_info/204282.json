Jumping is pretty hard so it's best to run back and make a running start, you can try to jump onto your blasts but that might be more difficult. WASD to move, left and right arrow keys to shoot! Win is kind of just...standing there but relish in knowing you got all the sushi and killed the bricks! Better if you play in fullscreen!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7f9f0a0840d8fee1bc1713e212039a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rocketplum"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
