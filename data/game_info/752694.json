Marvin the Minotaur. Defeat it and claim it's War Hammer if you so wish.\u00a0\u00a0From then on your opponents will be exceptional.\u00a0\u00a0The last fight is against the reigning champion, The Dark Knight<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>You start in your personal Locker Room where you are safe and can familiarize yourself with the controls.\u00a0\u00a0Look around and you will see a wall with icons. They represent your abilities and you can choose one to upgrade.</p>\n<p>To pick the ability to upgrade walk up to it and grab it.</p>\n<ul><li>Agility increases your chance to hit and dodge</li><li>Might significantly increases your damage</li><li>Skill increases your chance to hit and damage</li><li>Health significantly increases your hitpoints</li></ul>\n\n<p>Look around and you will see a wall with items. After each round will be one weapon and two pieces of armor.\u00a0Grabbing the item will equip it. Once equipped it can't be removed, only replaced with a new item.\u00a0Armor includes light, medium, and heavy. each tier increases protection without any detriment. Be sure to always pick up your armor between fights.\u00a0Weapons include dagger, short sword, long sword, club, mace, war hammer, and battle axe.</p>\n<p>Use your intuition when choosing a weapon and attack type. For example War Hammers have devastating bashing attacks, but have no stab or slash damage.</p>\n<p>Use your intuition when choosing an attack on a creature. The Reaper is made of solid living wood, bashing won't be as effective as slashing and chopping. A Dark Knight in full plate will shrug off slashes.</p>\n<p>In the corner of the room is a training dummy. You can practice your attacks against the dummy. It has the \"skills\" to represent a mid level opponent in the arena.</p>\n<p><strong>VR Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Motion and actions in VR can be done with gestures.<br/></p>\n<p>Walking:<br/>Walking happens in the direction you are looking. Walk in place to advance forward to the next square. (a side to side rocking motion from shifting weight on your feet seems to work best) You can also use the left thumbstick to walk forward by pushing the thumbstick forward. Backward and Strafing Left and Right can also be controlled by the Left-Thumbstick.<br/></p>\n<p>Waiting:<br/>Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to add a wait gesture. Please use the controller button (B)</p>\n<p>Attacking:<br/>Attacking happens in the direction you are looking.<br/><em>Bash:</em> Raise you right hand up and bring it down quickly in a straight line in front of you to bash.<br/><em>Slash: </em>Place you right hand to the left or right of your torso and swing to the opposite side while staying parallel to the ground to slash.<br/><em>Stab:</em> Rush your right hand forward while staying parallel to you head to stab. (make a stabbing motion in the direction you are looking<br/><em>Grab:</em> Put right hand forward while looking at the item to grab and make a pulling motion.

The VR aspect is really interesting. Tweaking balance is an ongoing issue and I still don't think I have it down right.\u00a0 Gestures are very fiddly to deal with.\u00a0 They work 90% of the time if you know what the gestures are looking for, but that 10% false negative is very annoying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are also some accessibility things I wish I could get in, like a Light/Bright Mode, and Snap Turn in VR.<br/></p>\n<p>My 2D Text UI render is done with Canvas2D on the main thread.\u00a0 In VR a full rerender of a screen will cause frame stutter.\u00a0 In the future if I continue VR games I will need a more performant GPU rendered Text UI engine.</p>\n<p>Features did get cut as I have run out of time.\u00a0 Some notable missing features:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>VR Wait Gesture (was going to be chest thumping)</li><li>Arena themes (sewers, forest, cave)</li><li>Arena traps</li><li>Cozier Locker Room</li></ul><p><strong>Bugfix and Accessibility update:</strong></p><p>Keybind screen wasn't listing some keys properly, it now does.<br/>Mouse sensitivity option wasn't displaying properly, it now does.<br/>Added an option to enable mouse invert, mouse invert is now off by default.<br/>Added an option to switch to a Light-Mode color scheme for the text mode ui (this isn't saved between games).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T08:17:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/138/1383ddb3d2bccb62b254f7a2edfaa1eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ibGoge"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
