Go play the original game!<br/></p>\n<p>So, there's a rhythm game on Roblox called Sound Space. When the absolute dumpster fire known as the audio update happened, the game closed. Along with\u00a0these audio changes, custom songs would be much harder to deal with, both because of the increased copyright policing and the new audio usage restrictions.</p>\n<p>This exists to fill the gaps that this update created.<br/></p>\r\nCustom Maps\r\n<p>You can load custom maps and songs, without worrying about the nightmare that is Roblox moderation. No more worrying about terrible moderation (anything remotely fast getting you banned for \"distorted audio\"), copyright issues, or songs that you simply can't use because of Roblox rules.</p>\r\nWorks offline!\r\n<p>Now you'll be able to play this even when your internet goes out! Because, let's face it, no one playing rhythm games enough to be using this kind of thing has any sort of life.</p>\n\n<p>Find a bug or have an idea for the game?
