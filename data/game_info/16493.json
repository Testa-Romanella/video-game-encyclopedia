To keep the citizens from turning to grumpy old men, the mayor organized big tractor races. And to make the races more entertaining he spreaded some of his so called regional products all over the tracks. Farmers from neighbouring villages and farms came on their shining machines to participate in the event. And you are one of them. Keep wining the races and soon your fame will reach other countries and you'll be able to buy new tractors to keep up with growing competition. And in the end, you'll end up entering world's best farmer competition in USA.Features:<ul><li>40 races in 7 unique categories\t<br/></li><li>funny and unpredictable bonuses along the way\t<br/></li><li>tons of fun and humour\t<br/></li><li>climatic soundtrack\t<br/></li><li>5 classic tractors</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T16:55:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a3/6a3c378a43ea335792d5ab816766e8cb.jpg", "website": "http://www.libredia.com/component/k2/item/121-redneck-racers", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 53}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Play, Silden"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Libredia"], "esrb_rating": null}
