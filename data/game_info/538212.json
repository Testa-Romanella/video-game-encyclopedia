It was programmed in Turbo Assembler V5.3 on theC64 full size computer. Due to memory restrictions, some of the features (smooth scrolling and sound) could not be added.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play<br/></strong>This is a simple score attack game, written in Cassette 50 style.\u00a0 The object of this game is to launch your Para Trooper safely on to the landing pads. Every time you land on a pad, it will be removed from the screen. The pads are colour coded and will give you the following scores:</p>\n<p>Red: 100 points<br/>Cyan: 200 points<br/>Green: 500 points</p>\n<p>Your score will also boost while you are falling.<br/></p>\n<p>Watch out for the airships and the water. If you hit an airship or touch the water, you will lose the game. Try to land as many para troopers as you can before you are finished.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Programming and graphics by <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Exomizer SFX de-cruncher by <strong>Magnus Lind</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T03:47:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80df12cde5e812243ee5257d7c24b711.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
