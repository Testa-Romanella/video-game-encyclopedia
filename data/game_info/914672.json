It's class leading design aspects lead to it being simple to operate and repair making it cheaper to run and\u00a0\u00a0more cost effective to own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The actual mod is a convert of Justin Gilbertson's beet equipment from FS19. But to make it compatible with 22 standards I have added.</p>\n<p>New Vmask Textures</p>\n<p>New Fs22 Animations</p>\n<p>New Fs22 Effects</p>\n<p>And New Fs22 Scripts.</p>\n<p>It is full compatible with the Amity 2720 and to actually lift the beets you actually need the 2720 (I know crazy right you need a lifter to lift the beets). Anyways there really isn't much left to say, its pretty self explanatory. Thanks again to Gilbertson for the perms to convert the mod.\u00a0another important thing is that I have made the trailer tongue on this mod without collisions so although it falls through the ground it at least will drag you down less when the tongue hits the drawbar on your tractor. I recommend that you prop up your implement on the ground when you first buy it so you can connect it to a tractor so you can get hydraulic power to lower the landing\u00a0legs. Just like in real life the landing legs are collapsed as standard and require hydraulic force from the tractor to lower or lift em.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyways long description over so enjoy.\u00a0For more cool screenshots and project updates check out my FB Page.
