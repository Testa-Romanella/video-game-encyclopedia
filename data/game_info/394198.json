Player 1 is Max named after my cat and player 2 is Rocky named after my dog!</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Down to Earth\" so I used plants and mossy terrain in the levels from Quixel megascans and I used character art from Paragon, a game that Epic released assets from for Unreal devs to use for free on the Unreal Marketplace.</p>\n<p>Getting this game down to under a gig was tough. I had to cut the music, sound fx, and particles to get it down to size. If I ever released it for real I would add all those things back in :)</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking it out! Feel free to download and play!</p>\n<p>Please comment and let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:55:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b50/b50597f24b0ac05e0a771084e64ae682.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FMJGAMES"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
