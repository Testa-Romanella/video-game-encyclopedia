Draw lines on the surface of cuboid puzzle parts, and take advantage of each piece's intricate geometry. You may need to snap multiple different puzzle pieces together at a precise angle and location to forge a path between every corresponding pair of dots. There are 100 levels which can be completed at any pace and require outside-the-cube thinking to solve. Think multidimensionally from the comfort of your floating-in-deep-space home.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T03:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14f/14ff35f72bbce149952cf0f5b6a2111d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Matthew Ardizzone"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Matthew Ardizzone"], "esrb_rating": null}
