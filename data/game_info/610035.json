And you as the player solve three Quests in this Adventure game. So it\u00b4s basically a game inside a game (Gameception).</p>\n<p>The playtime is roughly 9 minutes, it\u00b4s SFW and probably fine for children.</p>\n<p>Feedback / Critique is always welcome! The Project files are uploaded for the curious RPG Maker MZ Fellows.</p>\n<p>I really hope you enjoy/enjoyed the game and have a good time.</p>\n<p>Cheers</p>\n<p>Wesley</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T10:44:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32bbbbede47a3b4c4ac276f7f4dd2c22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wes_Blanko"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
