A natural extension would be to have other mechanisms than cogs, such as linear two-sided conveyor belts, motionless matter, rotative spots (which are really zero-radius gears), but I was also thinking obstacles could be possible, such as giant (clock) hands. I could already manage to have arbitrary number of notches, both directions, sticky and non-sticky gears \u2014 including gravity.</li><li>I was wondering whether to allow the player to gauge how much propelling power he could put, and decided on letting less possibilities for the sake of simplicity. If the game or a variant takes a more action-oriented turn, it would make more sense; I did not want to let dexterity play a role when I settled for a puzzle orientation (which can stil change!).</li><li>As hinted by level 7, the game does handle multiple alarm clocks. :)</li><li>I had plans for some cunning levels, but had to rush it; stay tuned for recrafted levels.</li><li>Notice the colour progression inside the alarm clock; I was considering using it as an integrated UI indication of either a time limit, a limited amount of turns, or how much damage had been taken (from getting hit by those unnerved purple squires). ;)</li></ul>\r\nA technical note\r\n<ul><li>No navigator version for the moment, as I did not use Ct.js, and love.js has some problems that I must solve for games to work properly. Anyway, there are Linux, macOS, and Windows desktop versions; please tell me if any version does not work properly.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T14:06:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a00/a00cfddba90c6df120f8648939644dd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mossieur Patate"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
