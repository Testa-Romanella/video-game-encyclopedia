It's an old school like game, with build and fight strategies, with resources, armies and economy. \r\n</p>\n<p>There are monthly rounds. You harvest these little red creatures, vampirix, from various buildings. They're not really vampires, but are related to Dracula. You also get scientists that keep the creatures under control. With your armies you attack other players or public places where you may get artifacts and potions. Strategy is the most important.</p>\n<p>There's also an economy. Your buildings produce money and there is also a market for free trade of artifacts and potions. </p>\n<p>There are also some contests and a good Trivia non stop game with prizes.</p>\n<p>There is a global chat window, because this is a multiplayer game, where you may see things that happen in the world of vampirix and share impressions or just talk. </p>\n\n<em>The purpose</em>\n<p>Your purpose is to have the most vampirix at the end of the round to win it. You can obtain vampirix in two ways: production and battle. Almost all buildings you own will give you some vampirix, per hour, because they are drawn to places of stress, tension and work. You may also get vampirix from other players, by attacking them.</p>\n<em>Vampirix Sudoku</em>\n<p>Between attacks and raids, players may enjoy a Vampirix version of sudoku that is available in the Contests area. The sudoku is using Vampirix cards of different colours instead of numbers and has it own highscore tables. </p>\n<em>Wheel of Fortune</em>\n<p>When you feel like you are not in a fighting mood, you may consume your public action points by spinning the Wheel of Fortune. The wheel may give you artifacts, potions or coins.</p>\n<em>Vampirix originated in Transylvania</em>\n<p>Legends say some eons ago, Dracula caught some weird flu and started sneezing. He sneezed for an entire day and could hardly sleep at all. He sneezed all over the place. The next night, as he woke up tired, he noticed all around him some weird little red creatures with vampire teeth. Those were the first vampirix. Apparently, he sneezed on some things that became alive or just transformed some living things into these little creatures. The full origin of vampirix is still a mystery. Even for Dracula. But he likes them. And they like him.</p>\n<p>Now, you may find them all over the world. If you know where and how to look. There are many types of vampirix, but that is another story to tell.</p>\n<ul><li> Real time game</li><li>Play with other players from all over the world</li><li>Every round lasts a month</li><li>There are prizes at the end of each round</li><li>Read more about vampirix and their Transylvanian origin</li><li>Game was made in real Transylvania</li><li>Artifacts and potions based on legends you know</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Official Website:</strong><br/> https://vampirix.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T09:09:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d18/d181ddbe15a7c2257393421d4c732dfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["City Beetles - From Transylvania"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
