You have to pull and push flaps to change the environment and to solve puzzles. The goal is to get to the evil parasite in time, to chase it away.</p>\n<p>Since we do not have the time to continue working on the project, we could not implement an end where the character wins and puts the evil back to rest. </p>\n\n\n<strong>Story Synopsis </strong>\n<p>Every time the book is opened, the story is told again. A magical pop-up world full of long forgotten temples is awaiting its demise, as an evil paper parasite is spreading through the pages. Its long tentacles drain the shrines of their energy while it grows stronger. The small paper guardian Snipsel sets out on a journey to put the parasite back to sleep, but time is against him as every minute the evil could take over.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Will he accomplish his mission? </p>\n\n<strong>Credits </strong>\n<p><strong>Lara Meyer</strong><br/>Tech Artist | 2D Artist | Game Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Lea Wagner</strong><br/>Animator | Tech Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Maximilian Rupp</strong><br/>Tech Artist | Game Developer | Character Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Alexander Staller </strong><br/>Composer</p>\n<p><strong>Tobias Hoehn</strong><br/>Sound Designer</p>\n<p><em>This game was created as a Semester Project at the University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Faculty of Media.<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T05:28:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71a/71a5c60ec4361a9fbb0550370775c81c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CraftyCardboardCrafters"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
