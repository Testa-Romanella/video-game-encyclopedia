This version works with touchscreen and keyboard alike.<br/><br/>Your task is to kick incoming projectiles to get points and stay in good shape. Receive 5 hits and you are rewarded with game over screen with your score and highest combo :).</p><p>Controls:<br/>I wanted to make desktop controls as minimalistic as possible so you have 4 buttons [WSAD] for 6 directions.<br/>Middle kicks are A and D.<br/>Upper kicks are W followed by side at which you want to kick [i.e. upper left is W,A combo].<br/>Lower kicks works the same - S,A  for lower left kick and S,D for lower right kick.</p><p>Touchscreen controls:<br/>there is an in-game tutorial, follow it and you will be fine.</p><p>Fave fun :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c13944056fd29aeaa3d232c080ee7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Melc Mo"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
