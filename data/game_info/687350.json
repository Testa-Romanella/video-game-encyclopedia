(Hint: It's 1,000 souls)</p>\n<p>Short Tutorial because I\u00a0can't fit in an in-game tutorial:</p>\n<p>This is an idle game, so all you need to do is put down decorations and pets and just wait for the souls to be collected! Once you have 1,000 souls, you beat the game!</p>\n<p>Having more pets and decorations increase the rate at which you collect souls, so put down more as you collect more!</p>\n\n<p>Credits in case the in-game credits doesn't work:</p>\n<p>Game Design, Programming, Sound Effects - Damakuno</p>\n<p>Background Art, Pets Art - Yules</p>\n<p>Decor Art - Kae</p>\n<p>Music</p>\n<p>- TipToes by Myuu -</p>\n<p>- Music presented by Mew &amp; Mew Music - (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6e6JvGcfvmxqxH9NjES5fA)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my Twitch Viewers!!</p><p>P.S.
