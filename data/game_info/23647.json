Smith in 1983 while a student at the University of Washington. The game was not only an award-winning bestseller, but also a significant milestone that influenced many in the video game industry. <br/><br/>Alexey Pajitnov, creator of Tetris, said of the game, \u201cMy favorite for many, many years.
