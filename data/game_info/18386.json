If you share my opinion that most recent games in the genre have been too easy on the puzzles - then this game is for you. This game will make you stop and think. You will think about the puzzles when you are away from the computer. The puzzles don't have many moving parts, so it's easy to combine them in your head. But the solution is rarely obvious and usually isn't the first thing that comes to your mind. <br/><br/>The game engine allows you to experiment with the world and try different approaches until you find one that works. Some of the puzzles can be solved in multiple different ways. Checkpoints are abundant and it's always easy to go for one more try. In the first chapter there are subtle clues in the environment like billboards or signs on walls that should give you hints.Features<ul><li>single player adventure<br/></li><li>local co-op with additional puzzles designed for two players<br/></li><li>original soundtrack<br/></li><li>support for various controllers<br/></li><li>support for older graphics cards and computers<br/></li><li>over 100 unique puzzles including switches, sensors, doors, elevators, movable blocks, lasers, mirrors, driving vehicles, flying a spaceship, manipulating gravity and your enemies</li></ul><br/>Players who want extra challenge can try to collect all the hats, which requires solving some optional difficult puzzles or solving the existing puzzles in different ways.Controller support<br/>Controllers are fully supported.

Co-op requires at least one controller. Other multiplayer modes require 1-4 controllers, depending on number of players. Only one player can use the keyboard.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a344ebf9463b4f95f1027c374c6eb5a.jpg", "website": "http://bigosaur.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 95}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bigosaur"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Bigosaur"], "esrb_rating": null}
