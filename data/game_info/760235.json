They haven\u2019t stepped beyond the high castle\u2019s bejeweled gates since they first arrived as a dirt-poor orphan from the far-flung kingdom of Dilaw. Their hunger \u2014 whether for a warm meal or for a better life \u2014 is insatiable.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>QUEEN BAHAGHARI</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sovereign of the seven kingdoms. Born of a dalliance between Pula\u2019s king and Asul\u2019s queen, she was raised by Lila\u2019s royal family. The potency and proficiency of her malicious magic are unparalleled throughout history.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>SANA</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Former heir of Asul and current commander of the high castle\u2019s knights. Although not as skilled in swordsmanship as her predecessor Yugto, she prevailed over her contemporaries from Pula\u2019s military academy owing chiefly to her sturdy shield spells.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>YUGTO</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cook of the high castle\u2019s kitchen. The queen discovered him in the slums of Pula and decided to harness his potential by declaring him her first commander. Since his retirement from the battlefield, he has sweetened and softened, just like freshly-baked bread.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>THE SEVEN HEIRS</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Royal children from the seven kingdoms, one of whom will succeed the sovereign upon her retirement or death. When heirs come of age, they relinquish their right to the high castle\u2019s throne in favor of younger heirs but continue to serve as royal advisors to the queen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><em>Writing:\u00a0</em>ilyilaice\r\n</li><li><em>Coding &amp; Programming:</em>\u00a0Marionette\r\n</li><li><em>Sprites &amp; BGs:</em>\u00a0applecidrdonut\r\n</li><li><em>CGs:</em>\u00a0what_an_animal\r\n</li><li><em>GUI:</em>\u00a0Gido<br/>\n</li><li><em>Music:</em>\u00a0Beans</li></ul>\n<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>Who is your favorite character?\r\n</li><li>What is your favorite ending?\r\n</li><li>Any thoughts or questions?\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing!</p><p>See the Lemma Soft forum thread here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T03:41:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07a282c102d795743443143fc8210f99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 330, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Marionette", "ilyilaice", "appleciderdonut"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
