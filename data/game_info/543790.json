A character, a game, a specific level... anything can be easily identified just by looking at a single frame. This is the main idea behind this little game: level packs with up to 100 levels, with exactly one picture per level. How many answers can you get?</p>\n<p><strong>Use hints to your advantage! (they're free)</strong></p>\n<p>Are you struggling with a certain level? Don't worry! Every level, no matter its difficulty, provides a hint that should help you with your research. Using hints is free and won't penalize you in any way. Who knows, maybe you'll discover your new favourite videogame all of a sudden!</p>\n<p><strong>But... there's only one level pack right now...</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I know (I made this game), but new packs will be added in the future! Just be patient, putting 100 pictures together, arranging them and writing a hint for each of them is no short task for one person.</p>\n<p>Also this is my first Unity project please have mercy lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T07:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01f/01ff4e1ed9570d3582be6cf4385ed080.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kolog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
