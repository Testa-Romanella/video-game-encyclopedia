In this game, two players compete with each other using their decks of ten cards and 15 life points. Each card is numbered from 0 to 9, and the game is played according to 33 rules.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a card from their deck without revealing it to their opponent. Once the attack phase starts, the cards of both players will be revealed, and the game will follow the 33 rules that determine the outcome of each round.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to engage in a battle of wits and luck? Play \"HeartStrike\" today and find out if you have what it takes to emerge victorious!</p>\r\nTips:\u00a0If you start playing in a card battle, press the question mark (?) button to know how to play, tips, and card rules.\r\n<p>You can play at this link below:</p>\n<p>Scratch:</p>\n<p>https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/831726260/</p>\n<p>This is made in TurboWarp, if you want to play this 20x faster than Scratch, you can go with this link:\r\n</p>\n<p>https://turbowarp.org/831726260\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Date uploaded: 04/06/23.</p>\n<p>&gt; No. of card rules at that time was \"21\".</p>\r\nUpdate:\r\n<p><strong>04/07/23:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0I've seen that 5 is a special card number so I added 6 card rules (21+6=27 card rules). Similar rules with 0 but in reverse. So I recolor card # 5 into the green.</li><li>\u00a0Lots of bug fixes such as card battle, card effect, save and load, and more.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>04/08/23:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0I add more 6 card rules (27+6=33 card rules). When 3 number card attack with 7 number cards or 4 number card attack with 6 number cards will result in both losing a life.</li><li>\u00a0I added the card rule # after the card attack to know what rule it is.</li><li>\u00a0I added a skip button when you read the card rule.</li><li>\u00a0I recolor card # 3,4,6,8.</li><li>\u00a0I adjust the picture size of Mahiru's icon to make it clear.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>04/10/23:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0I change the save and load system.</li><li>\u00a0There's converting code from text to number and from number to text.</li><li>\u00a0Added a loading when inputting the code.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>WIP:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>~ There's something I should add more rules.</li><li>~ Trying to find, trace, and fix the bug.</li></ul>\n\r\n!!
