Knowing just enough about Unity to follow what he was doing, I watched transfixed as he did indeed, knock out a game in forty minutes.\u00a0 As I watched, I imagined how I might make a similar game in Godot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took <em>me</em> more than forty minutes I can tell you.\u00a0But I had a <strong>lot </strong>of fun, added a few features  and learnt a shedload along the way. So without further ado,   here it is, in all it's erm.... glory?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Click the bouncing balls to pop them. Listen to the funky tunes. Enjoy :c)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b917525a19956283cad6d21d1105113a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sandry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
