It's inspired by GORILLAS (1991 - IBM)</p>\n<p>My main goal was to create a simple machine learning algorithm for the negative monkey. It can adjust its own parameters until it hits the player with a negative banana :) Oh, I've made it so the map is a bit procedural, just to get things more exciting\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this little game I've made. It's quite straightforward, but had lot's of fun doing it. I'd appreciate some feedback and, of course, bug reports are always welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0b/f0bdfa570e32a64a5f7489b831077540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VictorSouzaCV"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
