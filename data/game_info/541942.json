If you guess correctly, you will go first, if not-second. The first 2 moves are dealt cards. There are 16 of them in total. At the beginning of each round, 2 cards are issued. After the cards are dealt, you put any of your cards on the table (arena). You finish the MOVE. The opponent puts a card and if his card is more damage than yours and health, he beats your card. If the damage of the enemy card is less than your health, he will not be able to beat the card and in the next turn they are both destroyed. If the damage of the enemy card is equal to your health-mutual destruction of cards. There are a few nuances here. For example, the player who goes last and has both his card and the opponent in the arena hits. In special cases of a draw, the element of the card is taken into account ( water extinguishes fire, fire burns the earth) and the rest is neutral. One card can defeat no more than 2 opponents. After which they are both destroyed. If you made the last move with the Krakorus card, then you will defeat the opponent, otherwise he will kill you. In cases of equality-a draw.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T05:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/015/015830a7858eba8a365f0c2607a4d6ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["robot8784"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
