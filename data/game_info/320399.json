How doesn\u2019t really matter, the important part is that you got all these ridiculous parts to put on your weapon. Instead of focusing on stuff like survival and whatever (like you\u2019d normally do after the apocalypse) it\u2019s all about forging the wildest creations and showing them off in the arena. <br/><br/>Experiment with tons of crazy builds and fight other players in physics based combat. Earn more parts as you play so you can forge even wilder weapons. Oh, and heads up, the arenas you\u2019ll be fighting in hasn\u2019t exactly passed any health and safety inspection.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Sharp, flaming, shocking, poisonous or otherwise really dangerous weapon parts<br/></li><li>Fight in online multiplayer<br/></li><li>Find more weird parts as you play</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T12:29:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f9/4f911a68ffdd25ac2f7826326312d25b.jpg", "website": "http://www.flamebaitgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 17}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Flamebait Games", "Flamebait"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flamebait Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
