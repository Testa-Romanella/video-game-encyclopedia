Word has it he's in the very next city, but crossing the bridge to get there might not be so easy...</p>\n<p>Features a comedic storyline, classic point'n'click adventuring, minigames, a ton of art and animation and an unlockable director's commentary. There is also an unlockable medal system which gives you awards for performing specific actions. See if you can find them all!<br/></p>\n<p>The Search for Oceanspirit Dennis is my fifth point and click adventure game and the first to be made without a time limit. Consequently it's also my biggest and most polished adventure game to date. It takes place in the Oceanspirit Dennis universe - a shared world and set of characters created on the Adventure Game Studio forums - but is also fully enjoyable as a standalone game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T09:02:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a6f856b704fff06dcf944ee01213408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OneDollarProductions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
