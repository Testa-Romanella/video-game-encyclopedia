It's an unfinished buggy mess, practically unplayable and there I say it, barely stable.\u00a0 It was intended to be a small project to learn 3D game development in Unity. I can't really call it a complete 'video game', if anything, it's more like an early game concept. It's just\u00a0a collection of ideas splattered all over Unity\u00a0in no coherent order, with me trying to make sense of it all.\u00a0 Give it a try, be gentle and tell me what you think, all constructive feedback is welcome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T07:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f46/f4666b88e73eb7264ba67f36c36eaad8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Apollo Black"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
