Sneka must eat apples in order to grow big and strong. At first glance, this may seem quite simple, but Sneka has a rather strong metebolism, and therefore she should eat 4 apples every 10 seconds. As it grows, Sneka also gains strength and begins to crawl faster and faster. Can Sneka overcome all 5 levels and not die of hunger?</p>\n<p><strong>Features\u00a0 </strong><br/>* Each eaten apple adds some time<br/>* Each eaten apple\u00a0 increases speed slightly<br/>* You can cross the level border a bit (Otherwise, you will die)<br/>* You should not touch the walls and your segments (Otherwise, you will die)<br/>* The game is very random. If your time runs out quickly, then after a few attempts it may be that there will be too much time :D<br/>* The game is written in 20 completely unreadable lines of code :D\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>* Left, right to turn Sneka<br/>* Alt + Enter to fullscreen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T07:51:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69d/69d997ee469c2b9d0f2ac214b9e8d0f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SKleer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
