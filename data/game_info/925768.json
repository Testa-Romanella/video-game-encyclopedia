The blob wizard librarian must retrieve their book of spells! This was my first time  participating in a game jam! Let me know if you think it's too easy (I did basically no balancing), or if you find any bugs. I may make an updated version of this with more rooms (there are currently only around 10 variants including start room and backwards versions of the same room, so you will get the same room twice in a row a lot) and enemy types, and also maybe temporary upgrades at some point. I had to scrap a lot of ideas to get this done in time, so I have ideas I could add.\u00a0Also the menu is super ugly because I didn't have time to make better-looking art for it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:52:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/755/75507c2e409eb9498ffc3fe9f0490b14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SuperbPangolin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
