It was under development by a team of nine volunteers who call themselves Mane6. Being of a fan-made nature, this game was neither licensed nor endorsed by Hasbro.</p>\n<p>Though the game will no longer be developed based on the My Little Pony characters, the Mane6 team (with some membership changes) has reused the core gameplay elements they devised, with new non-copyrighted characters provided by artist Lauren Faust, the original creative lead on the Friendship is Magic series. In August 2015, the game was relaunched under the title Them&#39;s Fightin&#39; Herds. Them&#39;s Fightin&#39; Herds was submitted for crowdfunding through Indiegogo and surpassed its funding goal before the set deadline of October 22, 2015.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-09T05:28:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c7/9c7d21e028403f05374dff2abd779aab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mane6"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Mane6"], "esrb_rating": null}
