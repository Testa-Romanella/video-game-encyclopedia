{"id": 606423, "slug": "questball-2-prototype", "name": "QuestBall 2 (Prototype)", "name_original": "QuestBall 2 (Prototype)", "description": "<p><strong>Note: Controller required!</strong><br/></p>\r\nOverview\r\n<p>QuestBall 2 is a prototype\u00a0sequel to QuestBall, a fantasy tennis game released on mobile in 2020 that was TouchArcade game of the week. \u00a0This time around its a 5-a-side\u00a0team sport, a bit like handball or the Speedball games by The Bitmap Bros. released in late 80s / early 90s. \u00a0Its a 1-player game\u00a0\u00a0where you compete as the The Iceni Fire\u00a0(Boudica) vs Sherwood Thieves (Robin Hood). \u00a0Each match is 4 mins long\u00a0and you need to score the most\u00a0goals to win.</p>\n<p>QuestBall 2 was started and finished within a month, 19th April - 18th May 2021 to be precise.\u00a0It was approx. a week's work in total, largely using artwork and assets from the first QuestBall game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>If the prototype was ever expanded into a bigger game there would be a tournament of teams from around the world (all from an ancient / medieval period).\u00a0 A match\u00a0would have more variety in players, movement and\u00a0throwing with pick-up items, power-ups and the ability to manage your squad and their abilities.</em></p>\r\nGame per month 1\r\n<p>After releasing my last game QuestBall on mobile in Summer 2020 I found working on the next project a challenge. Part creative block, part COVID-era issues, the next big idea just never progressed. So I\u2019ve opted to make a series of games, each of them started and completed in a month. That\u2019s a month of spare time, evenings and the occasional working day (approx. one week's actual work\u00a0per month). I see each of them like a game jam, an experiment, a chance to try out a genre, style or technique. Its inspired by Sokpop Collective and Rami Ismail's Game a Week post.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Everything apart from audio\u00a0is by me, Stuart Wallace.\u00a0I'm a Scottish 40-something dad and app creator living near Brighton in the UK. I\u00a0dabble in game-making in my spare time. 99% of the artwork comes from the original\u00a0QuestBall \u00a0and was created on an iPad using ProCreate.\u00a0The game was\u00a0built and coded in Unity.</p>\n<p>Main music: \"The Adventure Begins\" by Bart Kelsey licensed CC-BY 3.0: https://opengameart.org/content/adventure-begins.</p>\n<p>Sound effects obtained from https://www.zapsplat.com.</p>\r\nDonations\r\n<p>This game is 100% free and you're welcome to download as such.
