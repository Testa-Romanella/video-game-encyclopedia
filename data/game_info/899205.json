Also map has 4 paths to the base, so player needs to be quick.<br/><br/>Authors: Juraj Zalabai (Programmer, 2D art),<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Martin Kuku\u010dka(Programmer)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Adri\u00e1n Kab\u00e1\u010d(Programmer)</p>\n<p>You can play this game with multiple tactics.
