Normal Pong is the first step on the familiarity pathway. i followed a youtube tutorial and then want off in my own zany direction :- )<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T11:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73f/73f20042844734095f6db6455d18ecbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jakeyouh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
