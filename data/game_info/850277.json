Three adventurers are called forth by the nearest Knight Lord and sent to investigate. The knight, swordsman, and mage aren't surprised to find monsters inhabit the place, but nothing will sway them from their all-important goal...<br/>To find treasure, of course! Why else would anyone rummage through an old tower in the middle of nowhere? It's not like ancient structures have anything else interesting in them.<br/><br/>Our adventurers of average ability are perfectly suited to this task, with each having a unique role in combat. Their skill lists are brief, but their abilities will need to be used to the fullest to fight off their increasingly fearsome foes\u2014especially the bosses. Perhaps some of the magical weapons in the tower will make traversing it less troublesome?<br/><br/>Anyway, the party has ample means to climb the tower. You'll be fine. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>Miscellaneous Features:<br/>-About 1 hour and 15 minutes of gameplay if you do everything<br/>-On-map encounters that do not respawn instead of random encounters<br/>-Bestiary with lists of enemy parameters, skills, and weaknesses<br/>-Boss battles with patterns and gimmicks<br/>-A few funnies<br/>-Plenty of tasty flavor text<br/>-Smaller numbers, if you're into that kind of thing</p>\n<p>Made with RPG Maker VX Ace</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T10:33:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8be/8be46da74fce53b9818266e4e015bde6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BladeThePieEater"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
