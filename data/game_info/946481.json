Play as Earth's first line of defence against the robot uprising, sabotage their defences and take out their agents. You're equipped with a high-tech weapon fabricator that will transform fallen robots into weapons for you to use.</p>\n<p>Drive the robots back, explore the weird and wild weapons your fabricator creates, and save the world!</p>\n\r\nResearch\u00a0Overview\r\n<p>My Masters research project is exploring the integration of evolutionary preference estimation and procedural content generation (PCG) in order to produce unique and personalised experiences for players in digital games. I am investigating the expression of biological evolutionary processes as a genetic algorithm to inform the content generation system as to what items the player prefers. The core motivation behind this project is to promote enjoyment and adherence to the experience, as well as to naturally represent currently underrepresented game playing styles; allowing for a much higher likelihood of players finding their niche.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T17:07:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ec/2ec365c844de19a2a07fa55b9565e60d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pheaton"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
