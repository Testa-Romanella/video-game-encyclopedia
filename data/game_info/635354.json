The size of the radar dots are actually scaled. <br/>\r\nIf the large green dot is off the radar, you are getting close to the ion field, of which will cost you points. <br/>\r\nIf you travel too far through the ion field, you will be returned to the center.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen weapons get a little hot they refuse to fire. Turning off Target Assist will help in cooling. Moving forward will also cool weapons down.<br/>\r\nIf you have Target Assist off and are also moving forward, the weapons will rapidly cool.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen asteroids get small they will be attracted to the density of the ship, and follow you.<br/>\r\nThere is an alert of a flashing red cockpit which is a warning an asteroid is close.<br/>\r\nThe map on the left of the cockpit dashboard will show you where the asteroids are, of which are closing in on you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOverdrive requires 10 points to use. If you do not have any points it will not activate.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is a sit back relax arcade style; however, as you approach 40 000 points, asteroids will spawn faster creating a more intense feel for the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRetromode does just that gives a retro arcade feel to the game. It also shows some space junk that may be difficult to see.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nType of asteroids Plasma, Crystal, Iron, Rock.<br/>\r\nEvery plasma asteroid destroyed will automatically increase ship controlls, turning, pitch and barrel roll.<br/>\r\nEvery crystal asteroid destroyed will increase the cooling rate of the weapons.<br/>\r\nEvery iron asteroid destroyed will repair/ ship damage.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter 6 asteroids are destroyed Auto Fire will engage. At this point Every Phase will then increase the fire rate of rapid fire.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPoints are achieved by every bullet that hits an asteroid, and every asteroid destroyed, destroying space junk and the UFO are the highest point value.<br/>\r\nThe UFO will not show up until 6000 points have been achieved, of which afterwards should most likely appear once pe game phase.<br/>\r\nSpace junk will most likely appear once per game phase.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T04:11:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d23/d238031c183ed77e7858bf9c98e2ba7d.jpg", "website": "http://www.2realvr.ca/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2REALVR"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["2REALVR"], "esrb_rating": null}
