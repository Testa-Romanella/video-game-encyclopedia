This is what happens when you have an idea and you don't finish. 1, 2, and 3 go on a strange adventure to discover themselves in the hyper-capitalist world of Final Fantasy 7. They will leave completely changed...<br/><br/>So the short version is, I tried to learn Twine and make something in a week, and I absolutely did not finish. But I had a great--if stressful--time of it! <br/></p>\n<p>So I'm submitting my incomplete project mostly as a proof of concept and to thank the organisers for giving me motivation. Currently I'm positive there are bugs and loads of things that don't link up properly, so I think I will keep working on this monstrosity until it approaches something I consider finished, and then release it properly at a later date.<br/></p>\n<p>In the full game we'll learn:<br/><br/>-What happened to 2 and 3?<br/>-What's behind the swap door?<br/>-What else does that strange old man have to say?<br/></p>\n<p>And last but not least:</p>\n<p>-What the hell is going on?<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to all who subject themselves to it for testing and competition purposes, and I hope this is an acceptable entry for the judges despite everything.<br/><br/>A<br/><br/><strong>Image credits:</strong><br/><br/><em>Grungy texture (blue, green, grey, orange), Denim, High Resolution Pattern #13, #14, #24, #31, #35, and Colorful Pattern</em> by Enrique Flouret under a CC BY 2.0 License<br/><br/><em>'Background 2' and 'Background 3' </em>by Stars*Go*Blue under a CC BY-ND 2.0 License<em><br/><br/>'Background'</em> by Kevin Dooley under a CC BY 2.0 License<br/></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bcf8016b57a2626c880976bcff7b314.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alyoshak"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
