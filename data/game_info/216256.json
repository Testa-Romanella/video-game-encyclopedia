Go check it out, I guess.<br/></p>Description:\r\n<p>This is a satirical take on the FNaF series where instead of hanging around during the night like a nightguard or a hooligan, you're there at an even scarier time. <strong><em>DURING THE DAY</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>D(ay)S(hift) a(t) F(reddy's) (or <em>DSAF</em>) is a visual novel and you use dialogue options and a map to navigate the pizzeria, each room has many activities for you to complete. You spend 5 days at Freddy's. You <em>DO</em> have choices and those choices <em>do</em> have consequences. There's 11 endings, each with varying degrees of pain, suffering and death. <em>Also, Breadbear.</em></p>\n<p>\"What do I do during the day?\" I hear you ask. Well, you can:</p>\n<ul><li>Sort through drawings to put on the walls!</li><li>Talk to Phone Guy.</li><li>Murder children dressed as an infamous movie character!</li><li>Scrounge around for change.</li><li>Play terrible minigames!</li><li>Exist in 1987.</li><li>Serve pizza with several toppings. </li><li>Wear springlock suits!\r\n-(this game was a mistake)</li><li>Eat salad, and then be fired for eating the aforementioned salad!</li></ul>\n<p>And more, because I clearly hate myself enough to make this. The game is complete, m80. Please, tell me what you think.</p>\n<p>Scott for FNaF, respective owners for Stock images, ArmedChalko for Breadbear, Incompetech for music, Yanfly, MOG, Hime and Galv for misc coding, FufuTheGargoyle for sprite work, Everything_Animations for models, Rick Astley also. If I forget anyone, tell me calmly and without pitchforks...</p>\r\nFAQ:\r\n<p><strong>\"What program did you use to make this?\"</strong>\r\nRPG Maker MV. It ain't free though.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Android/Mac ports?\"</strong> Nah. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Can I make a DSaF fangame?\"</strong>\r\nSounds redundant. The answer is: Yes. IF:\r\n1)It's clearly distinguishable from the originals and it's clear that it's a fangame of DSaF. Basically, \"Dayshift at Freddy's: 3/4/SL\" and \"Dayshift at X\" are not acceptable names, but almost <em>everything else is.</em> Basically, just be <em>slightly</em> original with the titles, <em>please.</em></p>\n<p>Also, you can use the renders from DSaF, and the stock images. You <em>cannot</em> use <em>any</em> of the Pixel Art in DSaF 1/2/3.</p>\n<p>Also, credit me. Those are my only three conditions. Don't steal pixel art, don't use the \"DSaF:X\" title format and credit me.</p>\n<p><strong>\"HOW DO I DO DAVE'S VOICE?!\"</strong>\r\nGo to Voiceforge. Wiseguy. How you record it is your concern, I'm not going to do a tutorial for that. Google it, and don't ask here.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Can I make an X port?\"</strong>\r\nNo. I don't allow DSaF 1/2/3 to be distributed for any reason.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Can you add X?\" </strong>Nah. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Do you need a beta tester?\"</strong>\r\nNope.</p>\n<p><strong>\"But, I won't/can't download the game.</strong>\"\r\nTalk to Itch.io about that. I don't run the website.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Where can I find the OST?\"</strong>\r\nYou can't.</p>\n<p><strong>\"The game won't save!\"</strong>\r\nI've answered this question a million times. Firstly, make sure you actually extracted the game. Yes? Now, google RPG Maker games not saving. This issue is on your end, not mine. It's a PC permissions error 90% of the time.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"I have a question that's answered here, in the FAQ, but I feel the need to ask you the question, because I don't like the answer listed here.\"</strong></p>\n<p>I hate you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/add/add52e443be00985d18da68eb6482df1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DirectDoggo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
