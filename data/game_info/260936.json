This was my first attempt at a game jam, and I am still super proud of how Dead Weight turned out! We had 3 days to make a game to the theme: 'The more you have, the worse it is.' So, the more treasure, crew and cannon balls you have the worse your ship becomes!</p>\n<p>Collect treasure and go for the high score! And for an added bonus, try and find all three game over screens!
