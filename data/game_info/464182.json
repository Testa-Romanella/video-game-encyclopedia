(at the moment) More of a demo than a game, but i've got plans to turn it into an actual prototype once the gamejam is over.</em><p>Tea time! The recipe for the perfect tea is simple:<strong> A tea bag, Water, 2 sugar cubes and\u00a0 \u00a0Milk</strong>! Careful tho, the train ride is bumpy.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS: A + D to move, LMB - pick up, RMB - rotate.</strong><br/></p><p><em><strong>Special thanks</strong>\u00a0to: Vladimir Gorobets, Vlad Ponomarev, Callum Hughes for helping me with brainstorming ideas.</em></p>\n<p>First time jammin, did the entire game on my own without a team and\u00a0uploaded it literally 2 seconds before the deadline, so don't be too harsh. No way in hell I could finish this in 2 days,\u00a0but this is what i have so far.\u00a0 Please don't be too mean, I needed more time lol</p>\n<p><strong><em>if you want to be in touch:</em></strong></p>\n<p>INSTAGRAM: NickMarkozov</p>\n<p>YOUTUBE: NickNoobles<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Things that I had no time to fix but\u00a0that will be adressed in the next update:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n- Resolution issues, Gameplay loopholes and other visual problems / missing elements.
