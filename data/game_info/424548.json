I will update this game later and more levels, bosses, enemy's, items and add some other stuff I did not have to time for (started late in the jam, like 9 days in total).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play - Controls</strong><br/><em>Made to work with an Xbox controller<br/></em></p>\n<p>- Directional keys or WASD + space bar to jump (or A on Xbox controller).<br/>- Sword Attack (if you have one) = Ctrl (or X on Xbox controller).</p>\n<p><strong>How to play - Controls</strong><br/>- Find out how to kill enemies, but not all can be killed.<br/>- Some enemy's or level elements need protection Items.<br/>- 2 stages (for now) defeat the boss and go the the next one<br/>- Its all mostly self-explanatory <br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play - TIP<br/></strong>- Get the no instant dead item first!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Roguelike - Concept<br/></strong>- all level \"rooms\" and \"boss rooms\" are random also to the path between them. I did not manage to make many rooms, bosses and enemy types yet. So just picture them in your head that they are\u00a0 there ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T04:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/521ad52445202ebdea39193928b2f131.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GULDOR, Learning to Code"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
