Poor framerate?\u00a0Download the Standalone version below and you'll have a much better time!)</p>\n<p>No one returns from the Cave of Past\u00a0Sorrows, but maybe you can die at peace with this past.<br/></p>\n\n<strong>AD/QD - MOVE</strong>\n<strong>SPACE - JUMP</strong>\n<strong>SPACE (MID-AIR) - DOUBLE JUMP</strong>\n<strong>S - DROP FROM A PLATFORM</strong>\n<strong>LEFT CLICK - SHOOT</strong>\n\n<p>You start in a small arena with a gun, and an enemy spawning near you. Shooting or avoiding it might be a good idea.</p>\n<p>Every 10 seconds, a new loop starts, spawning new enemies, but also\u00a0creating ghosts of every living creature, and repeating their actions from the previous loops. That includes yourself!</p>\n<p>Your bullets are bouncy, which means they can kill you.</p>\n<p>You can also die to the bullets of your past ghosts, so you should probably try to limit your shooting as much as you can.</p>\n<p>Every two loops, the room will extend, giving you more space to run around and more platforms to jump on.</p>\n<p>You unlock a new colour palette for every new loop you reach. You can swap the palette in the main menu.</p>\n<p>Each enemy type\u00a0has different behaviour and works with the loops in different ways...</p>\n\n\n<strong>Monsters:\u00a0</strong>\n<p>Don't die at the end of the loop.</p>\n<p>Will move towards you trying to eat your soul.</p>\n\n<strong>Spikies:</strong>\n<p>Die at the end of the loop</p>\n<p>Will shoot bullets around them, and more bullets if they are still alive towards the end of the loop.</p>\n\r\nMemories:\r\n<p>You will hate them.</p>\n<p>Die at the end of the loop.</p>\n<p>Will teleport to one of your ghosts, targeting it with a laser and killing it after a short delay.</p>\n<p>Every time they kill a ghost, they will shoot bullets toward the player. The more ghosts they kill, the more bullets they shoot.</p>\n<p>Will also shoot bullets toward the player when killed.</p>\n<p>You really will hate them.</p>\n\n<p>Programming, Art and Audio by jijigri.</p>\n<p>Created for the Black and White Jam #8.</p>\n<p>Engine: Unity</p>\n<p>Pixel Art: Aseprite</p>\n<p>Music: FL Studio</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: BFXR</p>\n<p>This one rewind sound I might have used too much: Zapsplat</p>\n<p>Hundred of thanks to you\u00a0for playing the game! I really hope you're enjoying it.</p>\n<p>If you read that far, let me challenge you. Try and get to loop 15 and you will be crowned king/queen of Cave of Past Sorrows!
