Remember how Dead Rising has only 72 hours? Well remember how your life has only a limited time too but you waste it reading stupid things like this?<br/><br/><br/>Every faction has it's own values, principles and moral standards so that means that whichever faction you might choose, they might ask you to do different kind of quests for them. Stealing from your enemies or killing them or some kind of activities that were once deemed illegal would not be pursued by the religious faction. Instead they will be looking for ways to influence settlements to their cause. With permadeath and 8 factions and each with their own way of doing things the game offers ton of replayability.<br/><br/><br/>                                                       *IMAGINE A COOL LOOKING GIF HERE*<br/>Yes there are, but the world is pretty unlimited too, and you still spend most of it in your room playing stupid vidya(that is, of course, until now, buy the game if you want to change that!). You can play the adorable idiot who is actually great at deception, the strong warrior who loves drinking, the quick killer, the schemer, the blind prophet, the villain, the shy but silent killer, the attractive seducer, the greedy businessman, the persuasive backstabber, etc.<br/><br/><br/>You know how sometimes developers throw all kinds of ummm... things together and somehow an interesting story creates itself that you can tell your friends? <strong>I mean you do not have any friends,</strong> of course, and that interesting story is as much interesting as someone telling you for half an hour what he had for breakfast. Anyways fullybroKEN has emergent narrative. The settlement current situation as well as the latest events change settlers and with that they might change their feelings towards anything. They might become crazy, depressed and based on that they will drive their story forwards. But those aren't the ones you should be afraid though. Backstabbers, ambitious and scheming people are part of every settlement waiting for their chance to strike.<br/><br/><br/>                                                       *IMAGINE A COOL LOOKING GIF HERE*<br/><strong>I mean it's only a game so not really dum dums, what am I, a GOD?</strong> Think about it. We live in a simulation right now, how can I create a something that's breathing and living? Anyways settlement arise and disappear, changing their allegiance, factions rise or disappear, events change the lives of both you and every other settler. Plagues and its long-term effects, leader changes, diseases, backstabbing b**** and many more, are the events that can happen in the country of Mir. And in the center of it all, is the player who can do whatever he/she wants.<br/><br/><br/>What's post-apocalyptic without survival? I don't know. No one knows. It's one of the secrets of the universe. You have some meters and not taking care of them unlocks special events and encounters, injuries and traits. All in all it's survival but it's finally bearable and fun(unlike some games which count calories consumed... I mean seriously?)<br/><br/><br/>There are ton of abilities, each with their unique sub effects, generated procedurally, inspired by a procedural item generation used in games like...  <strong>I MEAN WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER? YOU DON'T READ BOOKS YOU WON\"T READ THIS EITHER. KIDS NOWADAYS, OH I LISTEN TO MY BOOKS, I AM SO KOOL, SHUT UP YOU WON'T FIND SOMEONE TO MARRY YOU WITH THAT ATTITUDE.</strong> It's pointless. \"I read a game description on Steam and immediately bought the game\" - said no one ever. <br/><strong>The first dum dum that post a review with the words 10/10 would play again, get's a special reward ( ;) ).</strong><br/><br/><br/>This package includes the base game, the exclusive \"I am not a dum dum anymore\" certificate(asking for me to send it to you, immediately revokes the certificate) which can be used anywhere really, even in real life ( ;) ), another dust collector in your Steam library which you would probably never play and bugs. Hey it's an ambitious game, what else can I say. <br/><strong>*Sorry for my french, I am not a native speaker</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T05:00:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/6568672c1e2c7ee0731a99e9607a06a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Not The Best Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Not The Best Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
