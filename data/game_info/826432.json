The reason for this comparison is because it contains 2D (pixel-art) top-down story segments, with 3D first-person gameplay.</p>\n<p>My main idea and reasoning behind this project was to make a  game, with a harrowing, crushing story about a father's desperate attempts to save his daughter from an unkown sickness.</p>\n<p>The average playtime of the full release game is still to be deduced.</p>\n\r\n- STORY -\r\n<p>You play as a father who lost his wife to an unkown disease a year ago. Devastated by the loss of his wife, he went through depression. He needed therapy since the incident.</p>\n<p>Now, a year later, the same disease has befallen his daughter that he holds incredibly dear. <br/><br/>This drives the father into insanity, and starts making up fake scenarios in his head as a coping mechanism, where he convinced himself that he can save his daughter by doing things that are all a fiction of his mind.</p>\n\r\n- DISCLAIMER -\r\n<p>All credit has been given to the proper individuals for all free-to-use, CC0 licensed assets, such as models, textures, shaders, and music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T12:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f72/f725f5e9f0b46e7d60437d7694fe7f3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["D.
