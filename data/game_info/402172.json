The music was well-selected [...] I super enjoyed this game, and the technical polish was of a professional quality (as was the prose). It\u2019s one I could see myself playing again in the future, making different decisions, for the hell of it.<br/><br/>\r\nAlso, I got to give a benediction to some maggots at the behest of a face-stealing bugman. What more could I ask for in a game, I tell you?\"\r\nIF Comprehensive\r\n[I]t\u2019s well-paced, consistently interesting, and takes place in an original setting. [...] It\u2019s difficult to anticipate exactly how the conversation branches will affect the development of the plot, but there are definitely branch points in the story and meaningful choices to make. There are also three different mentors from which the player can choose, encouraging replaying the game. <br/><br/>The custom interface for the game is both beautifully designed and easy to use. The polished and professional writing is consistently strong throughout, conveying the utter alienness of the world and its inhabitants.\r\nQuantum Survivor\r\n[I]t employs its weird fiction tropes in service of a story that felt fresh and unusual for the genre. [...]\u00a0 I found it a well-written story that felt emotionally real despite the fantastical aspects of the situation, and while I can generally take or leave graphics and sound/music in IF, both the visual and sound design were well-done and helped to enhance the foreboding atmosphere.\r\nComfort Castle\r\nThe visual styling is great [...] \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen anything else like Baccaris\u2019 games. This game also comes with profile pictures and scene-setting pictures to dress up the text. Music is used throughout, with appropriate music selected to raise tension or fill quieter moments. [...] <br/><br/>Honestly, what I read into this game wasn\u2019t about being a human, but about being made an alien. There\u2019s a strand of imposter syndrome \u2013 being forced to fake it and hope you make it, feeling like an outcast, feeling like everyone mistrusts you. \r\n\u2742", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2e2e47ec2f1b6000e1879af7797ab3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grim \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
