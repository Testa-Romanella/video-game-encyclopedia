Passengers are waiting everywhere in anticipation, eager to be taken along for the ride. Collect them with your giant arms and shoot them at the flying targets to earn points and trigger fruity explosions. Drive as wildly as you can to keep them entertained for as long as possible. Floor the gas pedal, knock sheep and chicken out of the way and blast your horn to clear the path. The faster you go, the more fun your passengers will have and you'll be able to score a lot more points in big combos. But be careful that you don\u2019t crash into every tree, because otherwise the mood will drop and your ride will be over quickly. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controller</strong></p>\n<p>Steer: Left </p>\n<p>Collect: Trigger<br/></p>\n<p>Speed: A</p>\n<p>Shoot: X</p>\n<p>Honk: B</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keyboard<br/></strong><br/>Steer: A D<br/></p>\n<p>Collect:\u00a0 &lt; \u00a0&gt;<br/></p>\n<p>Speed: Space</p>\n<p>Shoot: E<br/></p>\n<p>Honk: F</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T05:40:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/869/86964e9bb6743d3e9576c38320f6fc58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LULUJUGA", "salvluc", "Lubba", "vantevnt"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
