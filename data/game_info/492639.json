But all is not well. The veil between living and dead is growing ever thinner and in order to avoid the seething rage of lingering ghosts, you must enter the land of dead and\u00a0uncover events of the past.</p>\n<p>This short narrative game is made by me, Mark. Student and ... I suppose also game maker. I decided to use the awesome Bitsy game engine for this project which means the game fits nicely into a pixel-art adventure game genre. The game will only take a few minutes to complete, but I hope it still manages to be enjoyable.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b3/4b38776596a589d24fecfa43094bbbee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mmarksp"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
