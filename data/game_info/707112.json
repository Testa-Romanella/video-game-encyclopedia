To shoot more - tap on screen. To move character tap on darker slots. Enemies spawn in three possessions and they shoot back. You can upgrade your damage and idle fire rate (crit chance not working). To access upgrades press on arrow in lower right corner. I guess have fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0This is short idea I had. Basically, this should be a mix of rogue like\u00a0and idle clicker games. It misses a lot of elements I meant to implement but I had no time and then no motivation to finish it. More ideas for this: bosses, more enemies, round system, items when leveling up and similar stuff.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T18:59:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10a/10abca55a5f793ce7d61f7d285a0d076.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelKTU"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
