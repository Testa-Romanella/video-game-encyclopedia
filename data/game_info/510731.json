{"id": 510731, "slug": "shaftshifter", "name": "ShaftShifter", "name_original": "ShaftShifter", "description": "<p><strong>READ THIS FIRST:</strong></p>\n<p>There's a known bug in Godot currently where a KinematicBody2D gets stuck when the corner of its rectangular collision shape collides precisely with the corner of another bodies.\u00a0This sometimes make the first playable character to get stuck in around the corner of the platform. The only workaround is to change the collision to Capsule or Circle shape but doing that will make the sliding movement buggy and jumpy. The other workaround is to make two collisions with the normal movement using the Capsule or Circle shape while it change to Rectangle temporarily when sliding. Although it can reduce the chance for the bug to happen (it happens pretty rare on its own though), it still doesn't solve the problem and the bug can still happen when you're sliding. <br/></p>\n<p>In the end, i leave the bug as is and didn't make an effort to work around it because the bug is not on my scope to fix it and the workaround will ruin the gameplay of the game.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>A lone adventurer woke up in an unknown place without memories...</p>\n<p>\"Where....and who am I....?\"</p>\n<p>Unbeknownstly, he woke up in the Crack of Multiverse, a place where many Universes converges. In that place, he found the Shaft Shifter, a strange machine that can travel between Universes. On his adventure, he meets many friend and foes alike, sometimes joining him traveling the Universes. Will his party solve the mystery of the Shaft Shifter ? Can he regains his memories and save the Multiverse ?</p>\n\n<p>Concept:</p>\n<p>A fast-paced   2d platformer, with less platforming and more action.\u00a0The player will have to reach until a certain point to clear a stage while clearing enemies on the way and staying alive. For one stage, you can choose a maximum of 4 between many characters, which will have their own mechanics. You can switch between the characters you have choosen mid-stage anytime for your advantage, but for this game there's only 2 playable character.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is submitted in the CSUI Individual Game Jam of 2020 and includes three diversifier provided by the game jam:</p>\n<ul><li>Starlight Breaker (Make your enemies your friend by beating them)</li></ul>\n<p>On a certain point, you can beat a boss which you can recruit to your party.
