It was done for the \"My First Game Jam\", but I forgot to submitt the game.<br/><br/>I didn't want to make another twinstick-shooter/vampire survivors clone.</p>\n<p>The goal is to find the teleporter to the next stage, with each stage beeing more difficult than the previous one. Gameplay is similar to hyper light drifter, meaning you have a primary and a secondary weapon, with the secondary having a limited resource, which gets charged by successful primary attacks.</p>\n<p>The controls area:</p>\n<p>W/A/S/D - move</p>\n<p>Space - dash<br/></p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - attack, heavy attack (hold)</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button/Control - use/hold secondary weapon (LMB to fire)<br/></p>\n<p>R - parry/block (hold)<br/></p>\n<p>E - use teleporter/open map<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Some usefull tips:<br/>- the dash has no i-frames, its purpose is mainly for positioning<br/>- the primary weapon has a combo-system, meaning the 2nd and 3rd sword swing will be more effective<br/>- melee hits will knock you and your enemies back, in opposing directions<br/>- parring does not consume stamina, and will make you move towards the enemy<br/>- ranged weapons stabilize when standing still, increasing thier accuracy<br/>- heavy attacks and blocking/parring will destroy hostile projectiles<br/>- enemies can get stunned by multiple consecutive hits, but some take more hits to trigger the stun, stunned enemies appear red<br/>- defeating an enemy directly after taking damage will recover your health<br/>- you can teleport at any time\u00a0to any cleared room using the map and clicking on the room you want to go<br/>- some rooms spawn a chest when cleared<br/>- healing above maximum health will grant heart fragments, which will add up to anouther heartcontainer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Credits:<br/>I used some free sound effects from this website:\u00a0https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/<br/>I used a color-pallate called apollo-32 (I don't remeber where I got it)<br/>And I used the 04FONT by Yuji Oshimoto<br/>And this video for screenshake:\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the other stuff was done by me in Godot and Aseprite\u00a0during the jam.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Known issues:<br/>- the learge enemies can get stuck in the wall after performing a jump, workaround -&gt; use heavy/charged attacks to hit them<br/>- some rooms spawn multiple chests on top of each other<br/>- sometimes a chest spawns while there are still enemies in the room<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:25:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0c/b0c8f8b9aee00b8c0df4a1304ad35847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HIKARU574"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
