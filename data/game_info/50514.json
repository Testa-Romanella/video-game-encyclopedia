{"id": 50514, "slug": "souland", "name": "Souland", "name_original": "Souland", "description": "There are many nations in Souland that you need to choose one to occupy and destroy other nations.<br/><br/>Each nation has several regions, each region has an army, and each battle must crush each other's fortress, or destroy all soldiers in each other's region, do one of them, then victory.<br/><br/>The number of soldiers in the troops is limited. A nation can deploy troops after a battle.<br/><br/>After a battle, the region will be owned by the winner. If all the regions owned by a nation were occupied, that nation is eliminated.<br/><br/>The battle can only be started by yourself. The other nations will not take the initiative to attack your army. However, if you win in a battle, the region will be owned by you. If you fail, the region will instead be owned by each other. So you may ask for trouble by just starting a war.<br/><br/>Gold will be earned at the end of each battle. Generally, the fewer dead and injured your soldiers and the fewer soldiers have been summoned, the more gold will be gained.<br/>After each battle, only one chance to deployed soldiers to other regions, or not. You can also use gold to buy soldiers, or improve troop capabilities.<br/><br/>The enemy will not enhance the value of the abilities(such as ATK, DEF), they will only depend on AI to defeat you, so your ability points is always greater than or equal to the enemy. This ensures fairness.Key Features:<ul><li>There may be about 20 nations(not yet done, I'm thinking constantly, maybe more or less).</li></ul><ul><li>Each nation has 18 common weapon types(7 light, 7 heavy, 4 range) and 6 special weapon types to use, primarily to increase game tactics. ATK, attack speed, attack range, KB as well as debuff, etc. for each weapon are not the same.</li></ul><ul><li>Hidden nations in the \"SELECT NATION\" page can be visible through the special operation by your luck. In fact, it is not difficult to find :)</li></ul><ul><li>Better AI to let you to play more exciting.</li></ul><ul><li>In May of this year, I wrote an pathfinding algorithm, tentatively named Swerve, after experiments, this algorithm will automatically encircle the enemy, the effect looks good and the CPU occupancy rate is low. Of course, some bugs have been found (for example, when two soldiers are together, they will keep moving forward, until stopped before reaching the wall), but I can't finished the algorithm now because it's too hard, I checked a whole day for this bug but I can't found it. but it will be fixed later.</li></ul><ul><li>Xbox controller supported(other controllers will be supported later).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57f6925ec1e374686c02fd6a21cea7c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ultraint"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ultraint"], "esrb_rating": null}
