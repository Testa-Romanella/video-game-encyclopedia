Check out the Steam community topic for more information on the redux and it's history.<br/></p>\r\nOriginal Description\r\nFirst-person shooters and roguelikes have finally tied the knot! Their offspring, ROGUE SHOOTER, tasks you with navigating a space station run amok. Blast aliens and kick robots in the face as you traverse each level; collecting weapons and gaining experience along the way. How far will you go when death lurks around every corner? Will you reach the 100th level and destroy the source of the station\u2019s corruption? Probably not, but it\u2019s worth a try.\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>100 random floors to fight through on a space station in chaos.</li><li>26 classic and bizarre weapons to collect, including a shotgun trident!</li><li>21 strange and unique enemies to combat, including carnivorous plants.</li><li>18 different types of items and gadgets to help you along the way.</li><li>8 collectable resources you can use to craft new items and supplies.</li><li>An unfolding story told through logs and characters you will meet.</li></ul>\r\nImportant Note\r\n<p>I have been unable to contact the original developer to get permission to use the original game's assets in this redux,  so I have decided to release this  as a kind of shareware demo which allows you to play only the first 10 floors for free. To unlock the rest of the  game you need to own the original Rogue Shooter on Steam.
