We began by thinking about how much of nature is out of control, and fun mechanics in games that demonstrate that. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Navigate across the ice as you leave destruction in your wake. Use W,A,S,D to move on to the ice, and you will continue sliding in that direction. Can you solve the puzzles while keeping nature intact? Or will the arctics feel your wrath?\"</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Original plans for the game included trying to save as many penguins and blocks of ice as possible to add extra challenge to taming\u00a0your \"out of control\" path of destruction. Unfortunately we didn't get to add that mechanic due to time, but we still got a fun game with a complete design and plenty of core mechanics.<br/></p>\n<p>Doing game jams is all about learning and challenging yourself to do new things, and the level design for a puzzle game is something I have always wanted to do. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:31:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5bea9047545af512c1b1a594ebd79e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rumphcolby"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
