Your only chance is the escape shuttle... but you need fuel and oxygen. And find the codes for the self-destruct... just hope IT does not find you first.<br/><br/><strong>What is it about?</strong><br/>The basic idea was a 2D survival horror game, loosely base on the old ZX81 game \"Alien\". You are alone on a spaceship and have to surive long enough to get the lifeboat up and running and escape form the horror. There are some Rogue-like elements, since you objectives and the items you find in a level are randomized.<br/><br/>The initial release contains a three part tutorial to get you familiar with the game concepts and three different levels for the main game. Replay value is achieved by combining the rogue-like elements with several difficulty levels.<br/><br/><strong>Initial Features</strong><br/><ul><li> 2D stealthy survival horror gameplay<br/></li><li> 3 tutorial levels<br/></li><li> 3 different levels for the single player \"Last Survivor\" mode.<br/></li><li> Rogue-like randomized objectives and item placements<br/></li><li> 3 difficulty levels</li></ul><br/><strong>Early access?</strong><br/>Once the basic gameplay works (\"Last Survivor\" mode), there are several directions I could take the game:<br/><br/>\"Fire Team (single player)\": Survive with a team of four characters to add tactical depth to the game and allow more complex game play?<br/><br/>\"Fire Team (couch co-op)\": This would also make couch co-op possible - why control all heroes when you can survive together with some friends?<br/><br/>\"Escape from Hallas Prime\": Or maybe focus on single player and add a story campaign with NPCs, in-engine cutscenes and more complex gameplay?<br/><br/>This is where your opinion comes in - if you like the gameplay and would like to see the game grow, which direction should I take?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T16:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/744bfd5c0e3b5cf1239644bcbc1d1ff8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eiloware"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["eiloware"], "esrb_rating": null}
