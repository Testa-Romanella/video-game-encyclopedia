{"id": 878946, "slug": "mad-surgeon-alien-clinic", "name": "Mad Surgeon: Alien Clinic", "name_original": "Mad Surgeon: Alien Clinic", "description": "<p>Your client, a blue alien, is a hot mess. He looks like a slime and he is desperate for a mind-blowing transformation to become a gorgeous hot alien. He shows you the photo that he is going for, at this moment you realize that it will be nearly impossible for you to reach his goal. But this client seems to be very rich, and stupid. So why not just take his money and give it a try? As a surgeon who is known for your plastic surgery skills(actually you are a terrible surgeon but you paid a lot for fake promotion), now it is time to perform the lip filler, breast implant, and lashes surgery on this alien. However, your hands can barely finish these tasks after you put the client in general anesthesia and there are many unexpected accidents that interrupt your surgery. Can you finish the surgery successfully and survive the accident?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a split-screen goofy plastic surgery game featuring two-player cooperation. Though the players will try their best to fulfill their needs and conduct the surgery, something unexpected will occur along the way. During the limited time of the surgery, one player uses the keyboard while another player is controlling the mouse. Both of them have to perform certain steps following the instructions, if one of the players fails to finish the given action they won\u2019t be able to finish the step successfully. Other than the surgery itself, some random accidents will stop players from pursuing their goals. They have to work together in case the surgery will be messed up.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T11:54:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/488/4884f482f5a29cc671644ab4c01aed0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cty288"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
