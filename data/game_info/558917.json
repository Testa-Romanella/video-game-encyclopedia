{"id": 558917, "slug": "portal-detective", "name": "Portal Detective", "name_original": "Portal Detective", "description": "<p>You're alone, in the depths of space. The building you're in is made up of a series of square\u00a0rooms containing unusual ornaments and varied lighting. The rooms are otherwise identical.<br/></p>\n<p>Each doorway from one room to the next seems mundane at first, but then you encounter one that seems... off. Maybe when you go through you don't end up in the room you expected, or light doesn't seem to travel through the doorway correctly. That's because that doorway is actually a portal.</p>\n<p>As you successfully identify portals, the building's layout changes. Gets larger, more complex, and the portal is harder to find, the layout harder to reckon with.</p>\n<p><em>This game was created within 72 hours for Ludum Dare 47. The theme was \"In A Loop\".</em></p>\n<p><em>Follow me on Twitter\u00a0@GuitarKidGames</em><br/></p>\r\nControls/How to play:\r\n<p>WASD to move, hold Shift to sprint,\u00a0Mouse to look</p>\n<p>If you think a doorway is actually a portal, then face it (you have to be close-ish) and <strong><em>RIGHT</em></strong>-click to make a guess.\u00a0 It's on the <strong>RIGHT </strong>mouse\u00a0button instead of the left to ensure you don't do it accidentally.</p>\n<p>You get 2 guesses, which reset when you successfully identify a portal (and you level up), or when you use all of them up (and you'll level down, the world resets too)</p>\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n<p>@toficofi For being a friend, but for this project specifically,\u00a0making room and plinth models</p>\n<p>@SebastianLague For all his videos, but most importantly for this project, open-sourcing the code for his amazing portals</p>\n<p>@sassqueenamy For encouraging me while I was in the thick of the jam</p>\r\nAudio credits:\r\n<p>Tranquility by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4543-tranquility<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Aturax's Cinematic Impacts by Aturax Audio (aturaxaudio.com)<br/>Link:\u00a0https://www.aturaxaudio.com/file-share<br/>License:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T08:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/716/7168c61b2a19051d0e6ed06d5b886916.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["guitar-kid"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
