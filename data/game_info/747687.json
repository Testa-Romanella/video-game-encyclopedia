And please dont rate the game on how good /bad the art is. Im just a junior programmer and i am no where near a good enough Artist for this type of caliber. I do believe that this game has unique ideas that not a lot of games have or even any at all. I have created all assets you see but I did get lots of refences from the Internet so do not be suprised if they look similar. I have used medibang paint pro to create all assets.</p>\n<p>I do hope you all enjoy your time playing my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T13:01:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b8/5b85a00bd07d0bc5939c4cce35bc4ccc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Master Zikki"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
