{"id": 5445, "slug": "pixeljunk-eden", "name": "PixelJunk Eden", "name_original": "PixelJunk Eden", "description": "<p>PixelJunk Eden is a 2D casual platformer as well as the part of the vast series divided into the two periods: Eden takes place within the first period and occupies the third position in it. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls the protagonist, Grimp, on its journey through the meditative worlds. The core gameplay mechanic is traveling by sticking to the objects. Locations called gardens to unlock when a certain amount of Spectra is met. The only enemies in the game are guardians \u2014 they can cut the protagonist&#39;s web which forces him to fall from the above. </p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>The game does not feature any prolonged narrative whatsoever. The absence of a wholesome storyline is compensated by the sound design, which creates the associations needed for the right attitude towards the game. The in-game mechanics also allow the title to have non-zero replayability.</p>\n<h3>Interesting features</h3>\n<p>PixelJunk Eden is the first game to support the PS3 trophy system natively \u2014 the other titles needed the appropriate patch. It is also the very musical game which is to be experienced through the artwork and sound design, not actual gameplay \u2014 Baiyon, the artist from Japan created all of the in-game backgrounds. The soundtrack and design have been largely contributed in by Dylan Cuthbert who has also created the sounds to the other PixelJunk titles.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2008-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-20T04:47:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ce/8cea9e18b2ca4453ec5ed36b18466c97.jpg", "website": "http://pixeljunk.jp", "rating": 2.94, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 48, "owned": 989, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 33, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 61, "ratings_count": 68, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 68, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PC"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Q-Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
