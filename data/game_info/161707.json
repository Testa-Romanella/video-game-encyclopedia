By lowering obstacles, by NOT tripping bad items, by NOT<br/> directly running over the bean and Smooshing it, </p>\n<p> and ideally, by doing it in as little time as possible if you are<br/> competitive and want to brag a bit :-)</p>\n<p> The target audience is early teens and older, due to the bean<br/> character being \"smooshed\", </p>\n<p> and humour content (very bad puns), </p>\n<p> There is no elite skill barrier - anyone capable of using a PC or<br/> Android tablet can play - albeit some better than others :-)</p>\n<p>Play Hard &amp; Roll Ball!</p>\n<p> -Morte</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/043/04336f39b529894300e515f911799b06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Morte"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
