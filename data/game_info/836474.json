After each battle you get to replace two tiles, choosing from a wide array of options. You get two random traits to potentially build around and a unique tile selection system; each run will be unique.<br/><br/>It takes the cards out of your hand and puts them on the table. Your deck is now the board. This drastically changes the gameplay and sets it apart from other games of the genre. Classic mechanics of the genre are warped or replaced entirely, and what's left is a game in a genre lots of us love that manages to find its own special niche.<br/><br/>Start with a basic mosaic, fighting your way through wild beasts. Replace two tiles after each battle, choosing new ones from a web of tiles where your choices now determine your options later. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Optimize your mosaic or fall prey to the monsters that await you at the end of your journey.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T04:31:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e7/0e72cf938f9b905d885fda4062460cca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1classydude"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["1classydude"], "esrb_rating": null}
