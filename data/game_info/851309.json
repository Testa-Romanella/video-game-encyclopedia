I struggled making the dominoes push the ball so I had a wall constraining it. Also, due to physics, the balls would fall towards the side of the ramps so I added walls to it too. I'm used to\u00a0ROBLOX's physics which I feel is better than Unity's at times so I was weirded out by this editor's physics but got used to it. The first ball is on top of the platform and you can see the red ball in front of the dominoes. The goal is at the bottom. The ball will fall off at the end due to physics so keep your eye out to find it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T12:50:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f04/f04374854322a85f8c1f68a0d3dd886a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ma5158"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
