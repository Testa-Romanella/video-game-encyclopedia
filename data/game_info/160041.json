A one-button platformer game where you switch the direction of gravity in order to dodge past obstacles and eventually reach the end of the level. Has a bonus infinite runner mode as well!</p>\n<p>Controls: Press Spacebar to switch from sliding on the floor to sliding on the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Credits go to Lukas Haak and Hussein Hassain for working with me on this project. We all made one level each and Lukas programmed the infinite level.</p>\n<p>Soundtracks - All royalty free:</p>\n<p>LukHash - Round The World<br/>Lyvo - your love<br/>Thoribass - Sunrise (mastered)<br/>Eve Catani -\u00a0Fizzlenizzle<br/>BitBurner - But Mom<br/>BitBurner - We Get Mental<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed0/ed05525e41128dfa5364853be83ed6b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DamienJS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
