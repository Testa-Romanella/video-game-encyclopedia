You play as Zel during a New Years festival. She's somewhat of a loner to her village. Learn about her story by helping her through some tough times.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>I recommend you play in full screen. :)</li><li>WASD to move</li><li>SPACE to interact</li><li>P (press, tap, or hold) to jump/fly</li><li>CLICK to interact with buttons</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Info</strong></p>\n<p>Hey all!\u00a0This is a small game I made for the Emotion &amp; Feelings Jam with the theme \"friendship.\" I wanted to take this time to explore my weird feelings with trusting my friends and telling them\u00a0my problems with anxiety and depression. I'm not a writer\u00a0and I'm still trying to process my feelings, so this isn't the best narrative ever. I had fun regardless! I'd like to learn and make more of these games.\u00a0I hope you enjoy. &lt;3</p>\n<p>Feel free to notify me of any bugs and I'll fix them up when I can.</p>\n<p><strong>Fun Features (these are actually bugs haha)</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>NPCs like to jerk around after you talk to them. They'll still be in the same place, so don't worry.</li><li>You can get TWO songs playing at the same time if you've reached the end and restart. Just refresh, the game doesn't save any data anyway, no problemo :D</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Code: April Denise, RPGTalk (Seize Studios)</li><li>Art: April Denise, Kenney Game Assets</li><li>Sounds: Bossa Town by Karate Studios, Fly Away by Jake Dalby, Letter Sounds by RPGTalk\u00a0(Seize Studios)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T04:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/932/93223791ea3c57ba02e4d338ddba7f66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["april denise"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
