This version doesn't have holograms, or a Wookiee for an\u00a0opponent, but you can play it right from your browser! Now\u00a0you and exactly one friend can master this spacey\u00a0strategy game. That's right, it's a two player game. Not one.\u00a0<strong>Two whole players!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This version of Dejarik is based on the board game version sold at <em>Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge</em> in the Disney Parks.\u00a0There weren't enough pixels for a detailed rules breakdown in-game, so here's a handy-dandy tutorial. Have fun!</p>\n<p>To the right, you'll see the PICO-8 cartridge for this game; if you own PICO-8 and would like to take a look at how I made it, be my guest!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>\u00a0Star Wars and all of its affiliated properties are the intellectual property of Lucasfilm Ltd. under Disney.
