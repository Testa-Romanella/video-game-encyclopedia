To clear letters, you have to build a word from them.  Words must be 3 letters or more in length and can only be built from the letters in a single tower.  If you can't clear a tower with the letters left in that tower, you can tap on the base of the tower to add another letter.  How quickly can you clear the towers?<br/><br/>High Score Challenge (requires in-app purchase) - The aim of this game is to build a good score. Longer words score better points, so take your time and get your brain in gear!  Words cannot span towers, but you can choose which tower you want to add each new letter to and you can see the upcoming letters, so plan ahead and add them wisely. <br/><br/>CrossOver (requires in-app purchase) - The aim of this game is to stop the towers filling with letters. Letters fall automatically and the rate they fall speeds up over time. You can clear letters by making words of 3 or more letters. The words can be made of letters from different towers. <br/><br/>CrossOver Plus (requires in-app purchase) - This is a harder version of the CrossOver game, where each tower starts filled with letters and you have 10 seconds to clear some of those letters before more start to drop. You can clear letters by making words of 3 or more letters. The words can be made of letters from different towers.<br/><br/>All games match words against an English word list.  Both American English and British English spellings are included.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:20:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc2/fc2718d82f18d68dcc7b50df3a827469.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Daniel MILLWOOD"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Daniel MILLWOOD"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
