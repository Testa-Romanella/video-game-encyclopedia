I\u2019ve managed several museums along the East coast. During that time, I had the privilege of working with the finest artist I had ever known. One Arthur Ward. Five years ago, he left to visit a cousin back East.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0It\u2019s been those 5 years since I\u2019ve heard from him. Just a few days ago, A week before the winter solstice, an e-mail arrived. Arthur said he needed my immediate assistance. He had a new work of art. One that played upon the light of a full Moon. As the winter solstice was on the full Moon this year. I was to come at once.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0A train ticket had been purchased in my name.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I will report back when I return.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Sincerely,\r\n  Clyde Otto<br/> <br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T17:01:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12f/12f421c6a8dada76eb3d7412e3e30c20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CPlBuddha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
