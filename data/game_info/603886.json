That's not good for a shark!<br/></p>\n\n<p>You can download the English version or the original Spanish version of the game (with more puns).</p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>\u201431 levels including a boss battle at the end!<br/>\u2014Lots and lots of differently behaved enemies.<br/>\u2014Puzzles about raising and lowering the water levels with faucets, corks, propellers, cannons and other mechanisms.<br/>\u2014Invisible currents? Don't worry! You can actually see them with your \"information\" key.<br/>\u2014Save your progress when you're tired and continue later! :P<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T11:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/423/423bf51a2d79c1f3e6697b496f5fa44e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fadri"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
