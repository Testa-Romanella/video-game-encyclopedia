This means the old project is therefore discontinued and would not be favorable, since Unity 5 is continuously evolving. </li>\n<li>\r\n\tSince this prototype was designed for network multiplayer RTS at the start of the development, it was intentionally designed so that no two players are using the same computer. If you are playing alone, you can open two webpages together. Please don't worry about Player 2 for now, and continue in the Start section below. </li>\n<li>\r\n\tUnity Web Player does not support high DPI displays or dual monitors setup. But this may change for Unity 5.3 and up, now that it has support for dual monitors. At the moment, it is currently not supported.<br/>\n</li><li>As of March 6, 2016, Multiplier is now the official game title, because I'm not talented in coming up with creative names. If you happen to know what name to give, please contact me at any time.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Introduction:</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tMultiplier, a simplistic real time strategy game, is based on math equations. Given any math equations, your unit depends on the results of said equations, and you can play to see how well your units are.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn other words, the game is simplified into only cloning, merging, and killing. You create clones, you merge, and you kill the other players.\r\nFuture plans may include cloning based on other simple math equations, such as the Fibonacci Sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...), or y = log(x), where x &gt;= 1.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn this build, you are able to create your own math expressions. As of October 23, 2015, the following simple arithmetic equations are supported:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Addition  (e.g., 1+3)</li>\n<li>Subtraction (e.g., 10-6)</li>\n<li>Multiplication (e.g., 2*13)</li>\n<li>Division (e.g., 14/7)</li>\n<li>Power (e.g., 3^4)</li>\n<li>Random (e.g., 5+r)</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tFuture math expressions may be supported.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTrello Scrum board can be found here. This shows the current progression and future plans of the project.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Start:</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou may play against yourself, or have someone to join you on another computer. If you are playing with yourself, you must also do the Player 2 instructions.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPlayer 1 is the host of the game. Player 2 is the client of the game.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Player 1 instructions (Host):</strong><br/>\n</p><ol>\n<li>Press \"Enable Match Maker\".</li>\n<li>In the input field, give your game session a name. For example, \"default\".</li>\n<li>Press \"Create Internet Match\".</li>\n<li>Wait for anyone to join. Game should start immediately afterwards.</li>\n</ol><p>\n<strong>Player 2 instructions (Client):</strong><br/>\n</p><ol>\n<li>Press \"Enable Match Maker\".</li>\n<li>Press \"Find Internet Match\".</li>\n<li>Near the top, if the game has found an internet match, it will display, \"Join Match: [Game Session Name]\". Press any one of them to join the game.</li>\n<li>Do not press \"Client Ready\", until your game finishes initializing. The client will automatically take care of this for you.</li>\n<li>Both players' games are now ready, and you're all set.</li>\n</ol><p>\r\n\tOnce both players are in the game, both players will start off with 1 unit each. Please continue to read Controls section for how to play.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Changelog: </strong>\n</p><p><strong>Known Issue: </strong>Multiplayer Mode and Singleplayer Mode may have hidden bugs due to game engine rewrite.  <br/>\n<strong>Known Issue: </strong>TODO messages are scattered through the scenes.
