Being able to control Popolon and Aphrodite means the player can switch between two characters that have slightly different abilities. For example, Popolon can push stones and open heavy doors. On the other hand, Aphrodite survives longer under water and she can shoot more projectiles. Should either character die, the other can visit a shrine and pay for resurrection. Unlike typical platform games, both characters can survive some damage as they have hit point bars.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-26T06:48:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/862/862be332b896df5cae683afe61e2da82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Konami", "Konami Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
