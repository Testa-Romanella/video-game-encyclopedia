{"id": 462137, "slug": "lurkers-battle-royale", "name": "Lurker's Battle Royale", "name_original": "Lurker's Battle Royale", "description": "<p>Super basic battle royale game where twitch viewers can fight against each other.</p>\n<p>It's just an alpha version with only 1 map enabled (max 8 players), it does not have music/sounds and sadly\u00a0I didn't add localization (only in\u00a0Spanish, sorry for that).</p>\n<p>I'm not working in this project anymore, I\u00a0might come back in the future. I can't make it open source\u00a0since\u00a0I'm using paid assets and\u00a0I can't share them.</p>\n<p>It's necessary to be streaming in Twitch's platform in order to play this game, and the game <strong>needs </strong>some\u00a0configuration:</p>\n<ul><li>1. Create a new file with the name <strong>config.json</strong></li><li>2. Add the following text:</li></ul>\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"username\": \"&lt;user_name&gt;\",\r\n    \"userToken\": \"&lt;user_token&gt;\",\r\n    \"channelName\": \"&lt;channel_name&gt;\"\r\n}\r\n<p>You need to replace <strong>&lt;user_token&gt;\u00a0</strong>with a token that can be obtained here. \u00a0Also you need to replace <strong>&lt;user_name&gt;\u00a0</strong>with the twitch account you used before to get the token. Besides, replace <strong>&lt;channel_name&gt;</strong> with your twitch channel's name.</p>\n<ul><li>3. Move the file to the directory:\u00a0<strong>%userprofile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Rhomita\\lurkers-battle-royale</strong></li></ul>\n<p>If you can see the \"Play\" and\u00a0\"Shop\" buttons in the game, it means that the configuration is OK, otherwise you will get an error message. Just send me a message if something is not working for you.</p>\n<p>In case you want to make a game which connects to twitch's chat, I've published the code for that, you can get it here (just for Unity)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T03:22:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f00/f009f6cfe0adeda8dc5c0eb876164156.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rhomita"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
