Maybe we even consider it, but still feel that strong savage urge to just bash and type in that keyboard.</p><p>Well, why not take those words and type them to an empty screen. They will be awful, hurtful and cruel, each letter will hit like a bullet each time you press a key on your keyboard, but they will never materialize, they will never actually reach that person, they will just fade away, only you knowing about their existence. And just like screaming into a pillow, it may help you relax and reconsider your approach.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d59ce16bef923f13add99f88cbae6e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["steanbuck"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
