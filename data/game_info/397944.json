{"id": 397944, "slug": "project-bones", "name": "Project Bones", "name_original": "Project Bones", "description": "<p>Project Bones is a prototype made using Tempest, an engine that I\u00a0made from scratch in c++. The game is a rough take on space invaders and is more of a technical test of Tempest to prove that I can make a game on it that can be published.\u00a0 I made all the art, music and code for the game (excluding a few libraries like freetype). This is the first game that I\u00a0have made and released outside of a game jam, and I'm really excited to finally be able to say that its done! It took me about 2 weeks to make the initial prototype, and about 6 months on and off to finalize the art, add new items and polish it. It's definitely still a demo, but I am proud of what I\u00a0have been able to do so far.</p>\n<p>Please leave any feedback that you have! I enjoyed making this game and can't want to use Tempest to its fullest on my next project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T03:48:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74f1e002d96d4b3456bd0a039c21adf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["layer8games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
