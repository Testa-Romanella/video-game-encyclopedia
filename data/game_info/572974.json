You're a runemaster that craft his own spells using runes, combining them for results beyond your immagination.</p><p>There's a prophecy and victory is achieved by fulfilling it [NO SPOILER!].</p><p>The game can be played with the keyboard, but based on the feedback I may try to come up with a mobile interface ... we'll see how it goes. The most important key to remember is '?' which open a context aware screen listing all keys you can use based on the screen you're in.</p><p>The code, as I'm Italian and had way less time then needed during the 7drl 2021, is a VERY BIG PLATE OF CARBONARA! Don't even try to find logic behind some of the decision I made ... it's working and for a ~50 hours game is all I care about. I've so many more rune, so many monster and so many items to add that if people like the game I may rewrite it from scratch and have something more stable to work with and expand on.</p><p>As always, the 7drl 2021 was A\u00a0BLAST! I had so much fun! Thanks all the organizers,\u00a0Slashie,\u00a0jmlait,\u00a0Darren Grey\u00a0and thanks to all participants! HAVE FUN and remember: PERMADEATH IS WAITING JUST AROUND THE CORNER! 8ppp</p><p>For any problem, feature request, bug or just to say hello, use the comments section. I'll try to answer as fast as i can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:24:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c408cfa13c4efe8485701e0ccd2e65fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Luca Giacometti"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
