{"id": 418072, "slug": "wizard-chess-7drl", "name": "Wizard Chess 7DRL", "name_original": "Wizard Chess 7DRL", "description": "<p>This is a roguelike/strategy game based in fantasy world populated by mythical races and creatures. Your main objective is to assemble an army big enough to conquer a certain city, and defeat the monsters guarding paths and treasures in the process. The game proceeds in two modes: the resource management-focused roguelike adventure, and the turn-based tactical combat remotely resembling chess - hence the name Wizard Chess.</p>\n<p>For those who had the pleasure to play Heroes of Might and Magic 2\u00a0&amp; 3, this game should look rather familiar - it's essentially a single-faction single-hero version of HMM. There were a couple of aspects of HMM that I wished were different:\u00a0the lack of realism (magic and realism, lol) around army supply lines, and the lack of nuance in battlefield positioning. This game is my attempt to address both.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, this game literally wouldn't look the same without the tiles, so here comes the attribution: Nevanda Nethack and David Gervais.</p>\n<p>Bring up the help menu on adventure map, battlefield, and city screens by clicking \"?\" on either your keyboard or bottom right corner of the graphical interface - it explains *cough* everything.</p>\n<p>Happy playing!
