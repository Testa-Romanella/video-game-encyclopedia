As it turns out, the reputation is deserved - the place is full of monsters nobody else seems to be able to see.</p>\n<p>It doesn't take long for them to notice me, either. But... not in the way you'd expect monsters to notice a human in their midst. <br/><br/>What do I do? Let an alkonost take me to tea? Or preserve the stability of the barrier between worlds? Even if the monster world is drawing me in, I can't help but feel like something about it is wrong. Broken. <br/><br/>And maybe I can fix it...<br/><br/><em>\"Monstrata Fracture\" is currently in development. We'll be updating it every couple of months with new content and characters.
