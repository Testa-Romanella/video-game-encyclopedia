We were able to patch it up, but had to disable the AI, so imagine the guards searching and hunting you when they see you. We will continue to work on the issue and update the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hector is upset. the world just does not appreciate him the way he deserves! He will prove them wrong. Hector understands the world he is in, it's all zeros and ones. And he has a gadget to hack his world and change it. Help him finally showing all those dum dums who is the true Alpha! But be careful not to break anything....</p>\n\n<p>Both the gameplay and the story play with the theme \"Breaking the rules\". Hector is breaking the rules on many levels: he breaks the law, he tries to jailbreak and he breaks the rules of his world, which is also reflected in the game mechanics.</p>\n\n<strong>How to play</strong>\n<p>Hector uses a gadget call Hacking Everything Console, short for H.E.C. with which he can change the settings of the world. His world consists of zeros and ones, true and false. You just need to swap those two words\u00a0on his gadget by pull and drop function. Wrong means turning stuff off, true means turning stuff on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the levels you will find Upgrades you can install to grant you more ways to break the game's rules, like walking through walls. Those upgrades are needed in order to progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To directly\u00a0interact with objects (opening &amp; closing doors, picking up upgrades, breaking coffee mugs and plates to lure guards away) use the SPACE key.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Movement keys are just commen aswd controls.</p>\n\n<p>Controls summary:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Movement &gt;&gt; aswd</p>\n<p>Interaction &gt;&gt; SPACE\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gadget display interaction &gt;&gt; mouse cursor with pull and drop</p>\r\nTeam members and Contributions\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>Jamie Fuchs: Programming and Unity Implementation\r\n</p>\n<p>Matthias Niedertscheider:\u00a0Level Design, Unity Implementation, Sounds\r\n</p>\n<p>Beatrice Fuchs: Visual and 2D Art, Animations, Sounds, Story and Writing\r\n</p>\n\r\nReferences\r\nCode References\r\n<p>Unity Grid System: Youtube -
