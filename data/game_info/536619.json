And you ended up right in that fridge. So now, you need to somehow escape it. But you have pretty limited time, because temperature in the fridge is constantly reducing. Lower the temperature - slower you move. Try to escape the fridge until temperature gets to the absolute zero (to not bore you with all the science stuff, here is the quick explanation: it's -273\u00b0C).</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Move with A and D (QWERTY layout) or with Q and D (AZERTY layout). Jump with space. When you are near the switch, press LMB to activate it. And most importantly, <strong>DON'T RAGE</strong>.
