{"id": 355016, "slug": "microcells-free", "name": "MicroCells Free", "name_original": "MicroCells Free", "description": "MicroCells Free is a highly enjoyable game. Once you start, you won\u2019t want to stop. The goal of the game is to clear the field from cute microbes. Try it, and see how high you can score. You have to group six or more microbes of the same color together. Once the microbes are grouped, your score increases, and the grouped microbes disappear to make room for more maneuvers. After each turn, iPhone (or iPod) puts more microbes on the board and your task becomes more difficult. The game is over when the board completely fills up. MicroCells supports GameCenter and Retina graphics. Enjoy the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T02:12:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/752/7525a41ce4e59ce2c179e87be544f62f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bootant"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Bootant"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
