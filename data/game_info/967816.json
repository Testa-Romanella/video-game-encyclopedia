Love in the bargain. ~~~~~~~~</h3><br/><br/><strong>The plan was supposed to be simple, almost ridiculously so.</strong><br/><br/>When her father, driven mad by years of grief, suddenly decided to force her into marrying him, <strong>Princess Kionna</strong> enlisted the help of her <strong>childhood friend</strong>. Together, they managed to contact her <strong>long-lost fairy godmother</strong>. Surely, her powers would save her from this hellish fate. Kionna would be able to escape the castle, a prince charming would find her, and they would live <strong>happily ever after</strong>.<br/><br/>Alas, magic can only do so much. Things keep spinning out of control. Trapped in an <strong>endless nightmare</strong>, the princess ceaselessly rewinds time in a race with death itself. <strong>Is a happy ending truly waiting for her at the end of the tunnel?</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Kionna</strong> perfectly encapsulates what you would expect from a fairytale princess.

And that is all that matters as far as she is concerned.<br/><br/>Or is it? For someone who always appears so unfazed, she seems to care an awful lot...<br/><br/><br/>While life is not as convenient as Kionna had hoped, her dream might not be completely out of her reach.
