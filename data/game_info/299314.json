This is a calm and simple game about catching planets made for the blackthorn prod game jam2.</p>\n<p>Control the net using the arrow keys. Catch a planet and place it into the box. You can only hold one planet at a time. If you hit another planet while one is in the net, it will bounce out.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to javidx9 (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) for access to his graphics engine and continuing to answer my silly questions.<br/></p>\n<p>All sounds from freesounds.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc6f67b392faf6a961a06bf12a97d36c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["fhionn"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
