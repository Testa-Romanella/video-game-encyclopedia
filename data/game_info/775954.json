It builds on a concept of controlling multiple entities at once to solve puzzles. The game focuses primarily on using multiple robots at once, and timing their movements for a successful outcome. It is very short, but I am quite happy with it. There are definitely bugs, and jumping is based on your framerate, but it's more satisfying to just be able to finally release it! Please play it, and let me know what you think!</p><p>V1.0 - Game Release</p><p>V1.01 - Lighting Updates</p>\n\n<p>Thankyou Quaternius for creating the robot model:\u00a0https://quaternius.itch.io/lowpoly-robot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T13:16:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7f/d7f964225a4df5b8e33b2692b04560d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JacobDWoodman"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
