The tactics in the game are in resource management and the placement of factories. Factories poop out minions that will find their way to the enemy facilities and destroy them. Once you destroy the enemy base, you win. simple.<br/><br/>Rover Wars has a neat local multiplayer system. It allows up to 8 users to join the game. To avoid couch conflicts we implemented some brilliant AI to battle cooperatively. There are always 2 teams and each side has a maximum of 4 Rovers. During battle, players can even switch teams or add some AI.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T02:38:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aa276b999555fcd705007b8ec4df04d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
