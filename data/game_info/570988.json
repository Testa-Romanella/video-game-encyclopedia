The hermit crab has only hard shells on the upper body but remained soft on the other parts of the body, so it needs to find empty shells of other animals to live in. The way of finding an empty shell wouldn\u2019t be easy, cause a hermit crab could mistakenly get into a piece of trash left on the beach, which will eventually cause the death of the hermit crab.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plastic debris in the ocean can entangle sea creatures unknowingly. it can act as both a barrier and a trap to countless populations. Each year 570,000 hermit crabs die after climbing into plastic debris, confusing it for empty shells.</p>\n<p>We hope that player could sense the difficulties of surviving for a hermit crab, and realize what consequences will our unconscious behavior of littering bring to the other members of the nature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a player, you may be able to play again, but the hermit crabs can never resurrect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e8/5e8608c76e53ffabd3a60bb411a5cd6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yibofu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
