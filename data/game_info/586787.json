The player can use this to their advantage and must use their skill and timing to survive. The player can dash around to avoid projectiles or change colour to pass through them gaining points for doing so. Players are also given the ability to slow down time, however they only have a limited amount and must increase the Slow Motion bar by passing through the same coloured objects\u00a0.The game is\u00a0endless with the speed of the game gradually increasing over time with the players goal being to achieve a high score which is gained be obtaining near miss bonuses to increase the score multiplier, passing through matching coloured shapes and surviving.
