But how can you do that?</p>\n<p>You can place and remove blocks at certain points. Don't use them without thinking, you can only place so many at once.<br/>Oh and don't forget to wake up the Minis. They'll move on their own, so don't worry about controlling them. If you want them to walk a bit faster or jump down higher platforms, just poke them gently.</p>\n<p>Can you lead them to the portal and their freedom without harming them?</p>\n\n<p>You control everything with your cursor. On PC you can use W, A, S and D to move the camera.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to\u00a0 \u00a0get a star rating:<br/></strong>- Finish the level (that's the easy one)<br/>- Collect all coins<br/>- All Minis have to enter the portal within a short time after the first one entered</p>\n\n<p>This game was made during the Mini Jam 87. The limitation was: The player is a pacifist.<br/>In this game you don't want to harm the Minis or other robots that may or may not get added later.<br/>The theme was: break.<br/>This theme was implemented a bit more subtile. The Minis take their break until you wake them up. Now are you rude or do they love you because you help them? But in their break? You could have at least waited for after their break.</p>\n<p><em>(Disclaimer: I didn't create the art, music or sound)</em></p>\n\n<p>Feel free to join https://discord.me/byxtogo\u00a0 to send me your feedback and ideas for future features!</p>\n<p>I'll continue the development of this game based on your feedback and interest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:39:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc25e95b6f9b50ae1a03b665638d18f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["byXToGo"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
