It handles all the management of a bingo game with manual controls or an automated experience with announcer. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow to Play:<br/>\r\nDisplay the game on a computer, TV or Projector and decide what bingo pattern everyone is playing toward (line, corners, T shape, etc.) before starting. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave everyone participating either download a bingo card app on their phones or use real bingo cards with chips and/or dabbers. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nStart the game and hit \"ENTER\" or click \"NEXT BALL\" to call out the next random ball. OR! if you prefer, press \"ESC\" to open the Settings and toggle \"Auto Play\" to have the game automatically call the next balls for you. If a number called is on anyone's sheet, they should mark that number on their sheet. This continues until someone reveals the pattern declared at the start of the game. Once that happens that person must call out \"BINGO\", then someone needs to press \"SPACE\" or click \"BINGO\" on the game to stop and verify. The person that called \"BINGO\" then reads out loud the numbers they used to create the pattern as someone verifies on the game that those numbers were in fact called. If all numbers read out were called in the game, select \"BINGO\" again to end the game declaring that person the winner, otherwise press \"ENTER\" or click \"Cancel\" to continue the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T11:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afe0861d17a31cb4fb630daaa9089406.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Vieira"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["John Vieira"], "esrb_rating": null}
