After all we've been through...\"<br/><br/>What do you want to be when you grow up? Paul thought his life would be set after college, but at 22 he's toiling away in a job he doesn't like and coming home to an empty apartment every night. He doesn't know who he is, where he's going, or how he fits into his world.<br/><br/>But then on one dark and stormy night, a mysterious woman appears to him, and everything changes...<br/><br/>The Beard in the Mirror is a throwback to when adventure games came in giant cardboard boxes and if you didn't have the hintbook, that was it; you were stuck on that puzzle for the rest of your life. It's a labor of love from a husband-and-wife team from two different worlds (she\u2019s a Sierra fangirl, and he\u2019s a LucasArts diehard) who have been working on it together since before they even started dating. <br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong> <ul> <li>A classic point-and-click adventure for the modern age!<br/> </li><li>Sincere yet lighthearted story with magic, danger, romance, and adventure<br/> </li><li>Death lurking around every corner!
