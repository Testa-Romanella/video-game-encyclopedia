This short simple game is meant to be a relaxing experience as you guide your cute little friend to his home.</p>\n<p>All assets were created specifically for this jam.</p>\n<p>If you ever get stuck on an object there is a reset button when you hit Esc. Or if you get stuck inside your own lines, right clicking the line will erase. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Theme: Less is more. Score at the end of each level is based off how much paint you used and how many lines your needed to draw. Less of both is how to get the highest score.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Esc - Pause</li><li>Space - Launch</li><li>Left Click - Draw Line</li><li>Right Click - Erase Line</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:57:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/126/12634b90052e57e9af8f72b71c9f435b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheRedTen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
