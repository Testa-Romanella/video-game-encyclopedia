No one has seen him at home for weeks.</p>\n<p>Only you, <strong>Catch Huntermann</strong>, world's best detective, can find the clues to figure out what happened to him.</p>\n<p>Nobody's Home is a graphic adventure game similar to LucasFilm's 90's classics, Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken.<br/>You interact with objects, read funny dialogues, and solve a puzzle. What more could you want from a game?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Nobody's Home was made for Itch.Io's Community Game Jam, in a week! Yes, a full working graphic adventure game, from scratch, in a week! So it's a really short game, and it might have a few bugs. But we plan on cleaning everything up in the coming weeks, and if the community wants it, we will expand it to be a fully featured graphic adventure game, with more rooms, NPCs, more inventory items, and funny stuff to do. So if you love graphic adventure games and you want to see more of detective Catch Huntermann, let us know!</p>\n<p>Controls are \"Ctrl\" to interact and \"Tab\" to open the inventory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:03:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91c/91c0f9f8763d633eaab80e1b9d445de5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kindermann Corp", "LordDiego"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
