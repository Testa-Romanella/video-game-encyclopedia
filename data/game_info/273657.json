But what can go wrong?<br/><strong>TONS of CHERNOBYL insects appear from dirty dishes, that\u2019s what can happen!</strong></p>\n<p>Can you protect a birthday party and family\u2019s cake from insects and keep good relationships with your family members?</p>\n<p>Destroy all insects, protect your cake and relationships! Good luck.</p>\n\n<p>Ludum Dare submission:</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/cake-hunters</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Left Mouse Button - attack insects or activate/deactivate family members <br/><br/> <strong>Mechanic:</strong><br/>The main goal is to survive insects invasion by killing all of them and protect the cake. <br/>The cake has some health, but it cannot stand attacks for very long, so do your best and try to keep insects away from it! <br/>To attack insects - hover the mouse over them and press LMB (click). <br/>Every single hit - 1 click. </p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong><br/>Ant has 1 health, so one click will destroy it. <br/>Fly has 2 health, 2 clicks required. <br/>The cockroach has 3 health, logical to assume 3 clicks required to kill it. <br/>Centipede... Well, let's keep it in secret :wink: But prepare yourself to click a lot if you want him to die! <br/> <br/><strong>Family members:\u00a0</strong><br/>Each family member can help you with killing insects, you just need to activate a member by clicking on him/her. <br/>They have their own zones where they deal a damage. <br/>But be aware, with time your family members will lose their mood, so be ready to deactivate them in time (by clicking on them again). <br/>So, you need to balance their help and their mood if you want them to be happy at the end of the game. <br/>They have 3 stages: happy, okay and sad. Don't let them be sad :( <br/>Family members are good helpers, but don't expect them to do all the dirty job for yourself! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Serhii Todosan - game design\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Vlad Melnyk - music, sfx\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Vitalii Zavoloka - programming\u00a0 \u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b97403c0e5615cf2eaef621c7336540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vitalii Zavoloka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
