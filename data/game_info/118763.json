I decided to do this following Ekimekim's GameBoy port from last year's game jam as well as Clever Machine Studios DesertBus2600.\u00a0 I started looking through tutorials on assembly, the 6502, and the NES itself about a week before Desert Bus for Hope 2017, hoping for the best.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Directions:\u00a0<br/>A -\u00a0Accelerate, Hold to keep moving\u00a0<br/>B - Brake, Will crash if idling too long!<br/>Select - Open Doors, When not moving\u00a0<br/>Start - Honk<br/>Up/Down - Steer, Keep correcting for the drift\u00a0</p>\n<p>Missing Features:<br/>Start Screen with name input<br/>Game Over screen (Game will reset when you crash)<br/>Points</p>\n<p>This is my second Desert Bus For Hope game jam.
