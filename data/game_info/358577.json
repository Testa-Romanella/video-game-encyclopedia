Art For Three was designed to be exhibited at events, but now you can play it from the comfort of your own home!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p> Plug in three controllers (they should *just work*)<br/> -or-<br/> WSAD to move, Q/E for A/B<br/> IJKL to move, U/O for A/B<br/> ARROWS to move, ENTER/SHIFT for A/B</p>\n<p> ...</p>\n<p> Run 'octosew.exe' or 'octosew.app'<br/> This name comes from the original inspiration for the game:<br/> Tracing, cutting, and sewing together octopus plushies.<br/> (You can still find the last few at www.wowowgifty.com)</p>\n<p> ...</p>\n<p> Press '0' to start or to extend the timer, 1 minute at a time.<br/> Originally this game was coin-operated...<br/> and this was the debug button to test it out.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/> <br/> Design, development, bad sprites by droqen<br/> Desk sprites by (redacted) <br/> Artworks (featured prominently in third image on the right) made by lots of people</p><p>First exhibited at\u00a0<strong>Bit Bazaar</strong> a few years ago! I forget how many.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to find your art:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Open up the _Data folder or right click on the .app (once I've uploaded it) and click 'Show Package Contents' and wander around blindly until you find the\u00a0<strong>Streaming Assets</strong> folder. All uploaded art is in there!</p>\n<p>Note that you have to upload art first by bringing it to the bottom-left hand corner. This game is really meant to be exhibited and not downloaded but I'm sure you can figure it out</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4ff32e012161948c48771e3145b207af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Droqen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
