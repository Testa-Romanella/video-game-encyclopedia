Looks like you just died due to an car accident.\u00a0No need to fret over it, such things happen all the time.\u00a0It's still really sad and unfortunate. Mmmmmh, that's a problem.\u00a0I'm in such a good mood today and I don't want you to ruin it with any sad fatal accidents. \u00b4</p>\n<p>I've got an idea. How about you try to cheer me up again with a little game.\u00a0Don't look so suspicious, there is something in it for you.\u00a0You do something for me and I do something for you, how does that sound?\u00a0No, you can't refuse, I'm god after all! And my word stands above all.</p>\n<p>Now, here's the deal:\u00a0Your soul will naturally seek its way up to me in heaven. There will be some other\u00a0souls on the way, but they're taking too long. Try to gather as many of them as you can.\u00a0If you get them all, I will reward you with a second chance in life!</p>\n<p>But there is a catch:\u00a0Your soul is very fragile and if it runs into any objekts on the way, it will break so\u00a0be on your guard. This may not sound very difficult, but humans have littered so much in space,\u00a0it has impacted the amount of souls arriving safely in heaven.\u00a0To help you, I will grant you additional protection for every soul collected.</p>\n<p>Now, good luck and do your best to be reborn!</p>\n<p>Move UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT: W/A/S/D</p>\n<p>Volume Up/Down: +/-</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n<p>- Collect souls</p>\n<p>- Don't hit objects</p>\n<p>- One additional hitpoint for every soul collected</p>\n<p>- This game was created for the Black and White Jam #0.(9)</p>\n<p>Music: Oriol E.
