It is necessary to place the boxes in the designated places. An astronaut can move only one box at a time, pushing it through the cells. It is necessary to brainstorm and calculate the moves in advance in order to pass this or that level, because there are a lot of boxes, and there is not enough space for their movement.<br/> Good luck at the marshalling space station!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T03:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/1397c265e1c61a7131f31cc94361cdef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stas Paty9mkin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
