Bomb Flip takes inspiration games like Minesweeper, Picture Cross, and some retro handheld games.<br/><br/># How to Play<br/><br/>Bomb Flip is a game in which you flip over cards to find numbers hidden beneath them. Under every card can be a 1, 2, 3, or Bomb (0).<br/><br/>The first number you flip over will give you that many Coins. From then on, the next number you find will multiply the total amount of Coins you've collected by that number.<br/><br/>If it's a 2, your total will be multiplied 2x.<br/><br/>If it's a 3, your total will be multiplied by 3x.<br/><br/>But if it's a Bomb, your total will be multiplied by 0. It's game over!<br/><br/>When a Bomb is flipped, you'll lose all the Coins you've collected in the current game.<br/><br/>If you find all the cards with a multiplier of 2 or greater, you win the game!<br/><br/># Coins and Items<br/><br/>Coins can be spent on Items to make the game easier and more skillful.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-14T04:28:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26f/26f3639b67ea3184eb506446cb91b24b.jpg", "website": "https://au5ton.github.io/BombFlip/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Austin Jackson"], "genres": ["Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Austin Jackson"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
