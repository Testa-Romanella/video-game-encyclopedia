Here you:</p><ul><li>Can launch as many balls as you want but each will cost you 50 sugar - the game's currency</li><li>Unlike other games you\u00a0don't get anything when breaking the block. You earn sugar by collecting block remainder particles</li><li>You can play levels in any order. First few levels are free but you have to spend some sugar to buy the others</li></ul><p>Your progress is saved to your SUGAR account so don't worry:\u00a0you don't have to unlock levels several times.</p><p>Press \"Escape\" during playing to return to the level selection menu.
