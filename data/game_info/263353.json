So how do you stop that? You put more durable things<br/>underneath the barrels, so you dont have to worry THAT much about it. Fortunately, the local smith sell those along with other pickaxes,<br/>so that you can dig those barrels away faster, so that you wont be losing too much money, when they're on the surface. Oh, and the world<br/>will blow up, soforth the barrels hit the earths' core, but don't worry. The steel blocks SHOULD keep them out.</p>\n<p>Did we mention, you live in a beautiful, lush, green forest? What could possibly happen to that when you're hiding tons of<br/>radioactive waste in the ground..?</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY TIPS</strong><br/>- You can climb on walls by pressing W when facing a wall.<br/>- Stacking a barrel on top of a barrel causes it to \"bleed\" double damage to the block underneath and so on.<br/>- You can hold enter for automining, however pressing enter in quick succession is faster than this.</p>\n<p>Enjoy exploring the small world of Contaminator!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/520/520d2f71649a086da47b9c62a0a344d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mikkel Blaase"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
