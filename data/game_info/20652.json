This is obviously a cause to embark on an epic quest to punish the troll in question, who just happens to be The Space Prince. Guide Serena through 7 stages of shmup action, jumping, shooting, and yet decidedly more jumping and shooting to her ultimate goal of total testicular annihilation of her foe. Ultionus is a love-letter to the home computer arcade games of the late 80s and early 90s, particularly Halloween Harry, Astro Marine Corps, Duke Nukem 2 and especially Phantis/Game Over II. The game features tons of lovingly crafted pixel art, and a rockin' chiptune soundtrack by the legendary Jake 'Virt' Kaufman.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-05T02:07:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24c34cd2f8558a6f27bc27dc4345cf80.jpg", "website": "http://darkfalzx.blogspot.com/p/ultionus-tale-of-petty-revenge.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 230, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Last Dimension", "darkfalzx"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Last Dimension"], "esrb_rating": null}
