You might be out-maned, but luckily your ship comes with two special cannons that can scan foods and replicate them as bullets! But be careful, because the food in your guns will start spoil and will expire all together if you leave them hot for too long! Collect the food, fight the enemies, and make it passed the 4 waves!</p>\r\nControls\r\nMouse and KeyboardControllerMoveWASD<br/>Left Stick<br/>ThrottleScroll WheelRight StickOpen InventoryShiftRight BumperFire Right CannonRight Mouse ButtonEast ButtonFire Left CannonLeft Mouse ButtonWest ButtonCycle Right Cannon AmmoRight Mouse ButtonEast ButtonCycle Left Cannon AmmoLeft Mouse ButtonWest ButtonPauseEscStart\r\n<p>In the settings, you can change whether you want to hold the button to keep the inventory open, or toggle it on-and-off. You can also invert the y-axis.</p>\n<br/>How To Play\r\nFly your ship by turning with your movement controls. You can\u2019t stop, but you can slow down and speed up with your throttle. Fly through pick ups (Pointed towards with pink arrows with squares on the end) to add that food to your inventory. Open your inventory, and cycle the weapon into the cannon you desire. Remember! You can\u2019t share one item between both guns. Once the item is above your cannon, close your inventory to load the item. While an item is loaded, it will start to expire. Once it is fully expired (As indicated by the temperature gauge near the item) it will be removed from your inventory. However, since opening your inventory gets the item out of the cannon, it will slowly start to \"cool down.\" Shoot the enemy ships that spawn thought the four waves to win!\r\n\r\nGame Jam\r\n<p>This game was made for JamCraft 5 and its themes of \"Alien\" and \"Expire.\" This game incorporates both by having you play in a flying saucer shooting other alien craft in space by using food that expires to power your weapons. This game also adheres to JamCraft's larger theme of crafting as switching out the \"ammo\" of each individual cannon allows you to create your perfect combat vehicle.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Code, Art, and Animation By</strong>: Calvin Evans</p>\n<p><strong>Created In:</strong> Unity, Visual Studio, Toon Boom Harmony, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Audition</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects Provided By:</strong> YouTube Sound Effects Library</p>\n<p><strong>Music Sources:</strong></p>\n<p>Destiny Day by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4984-destiny-day</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n\n<p>Limit 70 by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5710-limit-70</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n\n<p>Shiny Tech II by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4348-shiny-tech-ii</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n\n<p>Disco con Tutti by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3654-disco-con-tutti</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n\n<p>Danger Storm by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4985-danger-storm</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<p>Given that this game was made on a tight timeline, some issues were discovered that sadly couldn't be fixed before release.</p>\n<p>While the game does save your settings, it oddly does not apply your saved settings until you open the settings menu for the first time that session.</p>\n<p>Controller support is built-in but the throttle control is a bit off.
