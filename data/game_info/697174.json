Please download again. I apologize for the slipup, I removed the manifest txt file, thinking it would cause any issues.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Good day,</p>\n<p>This DEMO is my work in progress of an Unreal Engine 4 game I have been working on.\r\n</p>\n<p>The idea was to recreate the suspense of the original \"8 Pages\"\u00a0game, but in Unreal, with as high a fidelity as I could manage to achieve.\r\n</p>\n<p>I have changed the locations from those found in the original. The core gameplay loop is the same though, collecting pages will decrease the range the enemy spawns from you and if you look at him, you will lose health (the amount of health is based on the distance to the player) and eventually be taken. Looking away will regenerate your health.\r\n</p>\n<p>I included a few story and exploration elements into the game, as well as some other collectables.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I am trying to make the map feel cohesive as far as I can, making locations that makes sense in the context of the area, with a\u00a0cemetery, groundskeeper house and morgue as shown in the screenshots. This section is bordered by a river, that will eventually be surrounded by\u00a0other locations one might find in a forest / river setting. Perhaps a camp site with some recreational elements. You will have to make your way into the forest though, where the vegetation will get thicker and the paths more confusing.\r\n</p>\n<p>This playable DEMO\u00a0serve as a progress report of a work in progress. There are still a few locations to build, and wrinkles to iron out.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for viewing this page.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>As this will be my first published game, any feedback is greatly appreciated.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Things to note:\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>There is a blocking volume around the playable area.</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Slendy doesn't follow the player in this DEMO, as the AI is not yet completed.</strong>\n</li><li><strong>This DEMO serves as a game look and feel test.
