Try and beat all 35 floors, defeat whoever's at the top and escape these deep dungeons safely!</p>\n<p>In Stay Safe, death is punishable by a complete restart - as roguelikes do. There's no persistent savegames, there's no checkpoints - no hand holding, no easy mode. You go in it to win it and either come out alive and ruling, or <em>dead and drooling</em>.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you reach the top - defeating some other actual player's champion - you could finally be safe. And, hopefully, <em>Stay Safe</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>ALSO AVAILABLE ON DISCORD:</strong>\u00a0https://discord.gg/dRcNhzv</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong><br/>The game is in development still, but you can check it out already. It's even moddable with new graphics. Currently working on adding missing features to get out of alpha. Below you'll find three lists; features missing, features needing (re)work and possible features (needs, shoulds and wants). I work on this game in my free-time, so please bear with me (but donating helps me work more, dayjobs take too much time away from\u00a0game dev!).</p>\n<p><em>Current development cycle: crafting system &amp;\u00a0investigating multiplatform\u00a0(23 May 2019)</em></p>\n<p>Features missing and in active development:</p>\n<ul><li>More involved crafting, more recipes in general.<ul><li>NPCs that sell you recipes.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Features implemented but require work to make it \"fun\":</p>\n<ul><li>More (varied) themes.</li><li>More clutter in the dungeons to navigate through.\u00a0<ul><li>Objects you could pick up</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Features missing but planned:</p>\n<ul><li>Puzzles and more interesting obstacles.</li><li>More about other people's champions!\u00a0Should add some more personalization (e.g messages to leave behind?
