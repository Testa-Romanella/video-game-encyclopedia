Drawing inspiration from Dan-Ball's Powder Game and other games like Falling Sand, World of Sand, &amp; Powder Toy, we've added to the genre with a familiar player named Vuhrne and a ground breaking story. Solve engaging puzzles and experiment with hundreds of elements as you explore your way through the world in campaign mode, or join a friend and create a universe together that is entirely your own. Share your designs with the world in our online mod community and download mod content for endless hours of entertainment.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59eb8b11351497b722bd07c41c609f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kongroth"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
