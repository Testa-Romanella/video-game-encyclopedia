The game is based around a person who is in a new relationship with someone online &amp; they are not all they appear to be. Please note I am purposely keeping this creature out of the screenshots to avoid ruining the big reveal!<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/><br/>Mouse - Look around<br/>Left click - Interact with phone<br/><br/>There are no movement controls for walking etc etc as this is more of an interactive experience. Soak up the atmosphere &amp; enjoy playing with your phone in bed as you await....
