(Prototype)", "description": "<p><strong>ALL THE MUSIC ARE ORIGINAL AND MADE FOR THIS GAME</strong>. These are not songs taken from sites like YouTube, Soundcloud or these copyright-free sites that offers these songs. <strong>THE MUSIC OF THIS GAME DOES NOT EXIST ANYWHERE EXCEPT ON THIS GAME</strong>. They were made by a friend of mine called \"\u00b2He\", or \"Helium\". I also prototyped songs, but he did all the work for me.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can, of course, use the songs in this game however you like. Whether it's to upload it on YouTube or something, or use it in some kind of funny meme, you're free to do so,<strong> AS LONG AS YOU GIVE CREDIT.</strong> If you use the music from this game without giving and sort of credit or source, especially if you use the music as if it were YOURS, CREATED BY YOU, consequences can happen.\r\n</p>\r\nNow I want to talk about the things I still plan to implement in the game:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>All stages should be locked except for the first one. And the next stage would only be unlocked after completing the previous one.\r\n</li><li>Each stage must have a different gameplay and theme, to make the game more diverse and not boring.\r\n</li><li>Add some kind of gun shop, and use cryptocoins as the fictional in-game currency to buy guns, being used as another way of obtaining new guns besides loot boxes. The way to obtain these cryptocoins is yet 100% defined. (THIS ARE NOT REAL CRYPTOCOINS. FOR THE GOD'S SAKE, THIS ISN'T AN NFT GAME. AND I DON'T INTEND TO PUT IN-GAME MICROTRANSACTIONS.)\r\n</li><li>Add \"themed\" guns. That means, guns that has an reference to an existing game/series/book. Example: Adding the \"Pico Gun from Newgrounds\" to the game. Probably the only way to get them would be from the gun shop, or from hidden easter eggs.\r\n</li><li>Add official modding support, i.e. being able to add new stages, enemies, guns, etc. No need to get and modify the game's source code.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Anyways... That's it! I hope you enjoy the game. I know, this game is still very incomplete, but please know that this is the best I could do. The game was made with a lot of dedication and creativity.\r\n</p>\n<p>And of course, your feedback is <strong>VERY IMPORTANT!</strong> I'll be waiting for all the feedback this game receives.\r\n</p>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Game Design: pvini07BR<br/>Programming: pvini07BR (most of it), Charalian<br/>Music: \u00b2He (all songs), pvini07BR (song prototypes only_<br/>Art &amp; Design: dentinho, TKO, \u00b2He and pvini07BR<br/></strong><strong>Engine: Godot Engine</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T16:38:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ee/4ee37c9964166e0eda7e35c79c05025a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["PVINI GAMES"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
