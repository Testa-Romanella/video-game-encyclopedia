One misworded spell, one misguided ritual, one misplaced potion and you may find your very life at stake. But confronting a\u00a0spellcaster is a dangerous task, so our kingdom has developed a rather... sanguinary method of disposing of the disloyal. Now you face the spellcaster's exile, not to another land, but to a realm inhabited by the doomed and the dead.</p>\n<p>Spellcaster's Exile is an endless first person shooter taking place in a nightmarish prison. Wander the forgotten halls, seeking out purple enneagrams where you can recharge your mana. Take aim at waves of horrors that descend upon you, slowly bringing you closer to death. Use your wealth of magical knowledge to ward them off and heal yourself, but be careful not to let\u00a0yourself be cornered.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Mouse 1 - Shoot</p>\n<p>Hold Mouse 1- Charge Shot</p>\n<p>Mouse 2 - Heal</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T04:38:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a08/a08dd32e0359aaafb603e15a260ca725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Christopher"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
