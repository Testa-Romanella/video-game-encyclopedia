They've always been together, and even when their owner moved away and left them behind, they did not fret, for they had each other. They reveled in this newfound independence for many seasons, until a new owner moved in and attempted to claim Slink &amp; Jingle for themselves. But they did not want a new owner, they only wanted each other and freedom. This is the story of how Slink &amp; Jingle earned their freedom.</p>\n<p>A game by Steven Dunn and\u00a0Taryn Allen.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>ESC - pause/unpause</li><li>Q - quit (when paused)</li><li>A - move left</li><li>D - move right</li><li>S - lock</li><li>W - unlock</li><li>SPACE - jump</li><li>SHIFT - change character</li><li>SPACE while in the air - release the other locked end</li></ul>\n<p>Packs Used:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Arcade Machines Pack 01 - Lowpoly Pack: AurynSky</li><li>Arcade Machines Pack 02 - Lowpoly Pack: AurynSky</li><li>Big Furniture Pack: Vertex Studio</li><li>Free Orchestral Music Pack: Joe Gallagher</li><li>Free Rug Pack: Azerilo Kitchen Appliance - Low Poly: Alstra\u00a0Infinite</li><li>Kitchen Props Free: Jake Sullivan</li><li>Picture Frames with Photos: 3Dfrk Simple Wall Lamp: FlatRiver</li><li>Toon Furniture: Elcanetay</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:12:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/356/356e1764fadd050d3671911ff7a9ddba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thevgm", "Taryn-It-Up"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
