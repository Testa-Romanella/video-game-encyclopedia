I either bought them or had made them previously. Everything else was done by me within the jam period. (design/animation/art/programming).</p>\n<p>The theme was really interesting! (It was about duel-purpose design and used Downwell as an) What came out in \"Warden\" is just a lot of different ways that the mouse uses the shield. You can use it to block things of course, but also to float and bounce. You can block things while you're sliding and floating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first inspiration for a mechanic I had in mind didn't actually make it into the game!\u00a0The idea was when you put your shield away, you would swipe and be able to knock things back. But as I was making it, there wasn't as much I could do with that as the movement mechanics that I ended up putting in, so I went with what felt good! It was a really good inspiration and I'm really happy with the game! (I mean, little bugs and minor design issues aside.)\u00a0I feel like this is the most work I've done in a jam... Though I didn't have time to put any story in whatsoever. :P</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Gamepad -\u00a0Dpad/joystick to move. A to jump.
