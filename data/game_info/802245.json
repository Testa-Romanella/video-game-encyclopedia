Through the thick, bulletproof windows you see only stars surrounding you in an ocean of endless boundaries.\u00a0 Who are you?\u00a0Where are you? These are all questions going through your head as suddenly a robot voice speaks to you from seemingly all areas around you.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\"Aaaah, good. You're finally awake. Well, let's get to work shall we?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Quickly you are tasked with summoning your personal assistant, Bob The Robot, and together you enter one simulation after the other, trying to solve environmental puzzle games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heavily inspired by Portal and the Standley Parable, this short demo will take you through a handful of different simulations, offering you a few brain gymnastics while also giving you a hearty chuckle or\u00a0two!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Designer's note:</p>\n<p>No Portals here is a cheeky demo game made at the conclusion of my second semester as an aspiring game designer. It mixes Synty Polygon assets with my own as I sought to try and better myself at making 3D-assets and materials.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please enjoy the demo,</p>\n<p>The Dane.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T12:02:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bd/7bde512bea90c2565d39e50cf8edab9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lasse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
