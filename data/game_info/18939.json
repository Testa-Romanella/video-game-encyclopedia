Each green element you touch gives you 5 points. <br/>COMBO MODE - This game mode combines the other modes for a harder, faster, and stronger experience.<br/><br/>\"Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. <br/>Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.\" <br/><strong>- Bruce Lee</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T06:17:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e29/e291002fb168763508f3b46785c0a062.jpg", "website": "http://www.backtobasicsgaming.com/", "rating": 1.44, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 433, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PRORTUS"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Back To Basics Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
