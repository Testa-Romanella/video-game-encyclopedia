Plant pairs with a space between them, and when you press \"PLAY\", the space will be filled by the pair's combination (eg a red flower and a yellow flower will form an orange flower). Using the flowers given to you, form the pattern in the goal board.<br/></p>\r\nFEATURES:\r\n<ul><li>A\u00a010 level \"campaign\", the first 5 teach the flower combinations and the last 5 focused on using them in specially-designed puzzles.\u00a0</li><li>A random level generator, which varies in difficulty from \"don't even need to plant anything\" to \"harder than most of the campaign levels\"</li><li>A freeplay mode, where you can plant infinite Red, White, Blue, or Yellow flowers and can try to design your own patterns. In this mode there is no winning or losing so you can get different flower colours by planting pairs, running the game, and undoing the placed flowers.</li><li>IN A FUTURE UPDATE: Will add a colourblind mode</li></ul>\r\nTUTORIAL:\r\n<ul><li>The entire game is controlled using a mouse or touchscreen.</li><li>Select a flower from the top-left bar, and then click a tile on the bottom-left grid to plant it.</li><li>The goal board is in the top-right. At every tile on the goal board must either match it's counterpart on the game board, or be empty.</li><li>When you have planted however many flowers you want to, press \"PLAY\". Any empty spaces between two compatible flowers will be filled by their combination (eg red + yellow = orange, or green + blue = cyan).</li><li>The \"UNDO\" button removes the last placed flower, while the \"RESET\" button removes them all at once. (in the freeplay mode, \"UNDO\" only removes flowers you have placed, while \"RESET\" will remove\u00a0all flowers)</li><li>Press \"QUIT\" when within a level to return to the selection menu.</li></ul>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<ul><li>Programming and design by D Lawson</li><li>Art and Music credited below</li></ul>\r\nASSETS USED:\r\n<ul><li>Kenney Font Package - Kenney\r\n</li><li>Roguelike / RPG Pack - Kenney</li><li>Blueberries -\u00a0Viktor Kraus</li><li>Win Sound #1 -\u00a0remaxim</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T06:13:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cd/1cd1a251b0d9a3ea5a4cbe1c3e5d2078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Donian"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
