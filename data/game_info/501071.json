You are to give a public speech, but you have lost your marbles, so you are struggling very badly. Fortunately they are flying about in the air, so you must drop them towards the floor and put them in your head!<br/></p>\n<p>Move Doris left and right on the stage, and catch any marbles by dropping them then moving over to them! Collect as many marbles as you can to achieve a higher score! Miss 3 marbles and it's over!</p>\n<p>Be careful! As you get further into the game, the marbles will become faster and appear more frequently. There are also protesters who will emerge from the bottom and\u00a0throw tomatoes at Doris, stunning him and costing the player a life. You can either dodge the tomato or bonk the protester away. Red protesters will also aim directly at Doris, so they must be bonked.</p>\n<p>This game makes use of the Keyboard and Mouse. The controls are as follows;</p>\n<ul><li>Use A and D or the left and right arrow keys to move Doris.</li><li>Click on marbles to drop them.</li><li>Click on Protesters to bonk them away.</li><li>Use the mouse to navigate menus.</li></ul>\n<p>This game was created for the SURGE game jam in my local area. The theme was \"put marbles in the heads of world leaders\", and it was created over the course of the entire weekend.</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:52:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e2/6e2ac7ba7ae44ed943eecf643fcf4ff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VideoGameKid265"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
