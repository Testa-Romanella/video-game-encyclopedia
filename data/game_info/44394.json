First Collect the broken crystal shards then follow the unraveling poems of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGENIE is a couple of hours of a relaxing experience. A rich story that's presented in a poetic form combined with immersive graphics, fantasy style, gorgeous natural environments that take place in varied eras, made with Unreal Engine 5, and a charming soundtrack to make it a journey you may not soon forget. Enjoy the environments!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the first half of the levels, the player collects crystal shards scattered around the map. When they collect all the shards, the poem-spots start to appear one by one. When the player stands on them, they have to find a light source around them and focus on it. When that happens, the camera view changes and the narration begins. After that is done, the next poem-spot reveals, and so on until the next level begins.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGENIE is the re-creation of Drizzlepath: Genie which was released in 2016. The environments are made from scratch, the story is altered and transformed into poem form. A highly talented voice actor has recorded the full narration of the game. The music is revisited (with a single exception) with a selection of more atmospheric tracks.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is divided into 15 parts which take about 5-10 minutes each; the progress is saved at their beginnings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It offers almost zero interaction and is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T04:11:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71d/71d636328f04394547ecb67a5bbf25e4.jpg", "website": "https://tongucbodur.com/genie-1", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 339, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur", "X3 Brothers"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur", "X3 Brothers"], "esrb_rating": null}
