Some people seem to have huge problems grasping what to do so I just wanted to fight against frustration :)</p>\n<p><strong>Blind are the ones\u2019 afraid to see. So do you dare to stare into the abyss?</strong></p>\n<p>Luvius is a small game made for Ludum Dare 39. It relies heavily on positional audio cues - \u00a0but most people should be fine with their audio systems.\u00a0\u00a0You NEED to crank you audio up to enjoy this - there are no jumpscares.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play (there is also an in development ingame tutorial)</strong></p>\n<p>You're hunted. In order to escape you must find the safe way - and you only hear your enemy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the start of each round the level will be illuminated for a very short time. Memorize the locations of the doors, then click on a door which you think is safe. \u00a0If your decision was correct you will find yourself in the next room otherwise it's back to the start of the level.</p>\n<p>If you forget where the door is click to activate your flashlight. But be careful: the flashlights batteries are only refilled every level!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you have any feedback - positive and negative - please consider adding it on the Ludum Dare page! -&gt;\u00a0LD Link</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Attributions</strong></p>\n<p>Fonts (SIL Open Font License 1.1):</p>\n<p>Reenie Beanie<br/>Zilla Slab Highlight</p>\n<p>All music and sound effects were obtained from OpenGameArt.</p>\n<p>Music (CC0):<br/>Waking the devil by Alexander Ehlers<br/>The Field of Dreams by Paulius Jurgelevi\u00e8ius (aka pauliuw)</p>\n<p>Music (CC-BY 3.0):<br/>Myst by Zhelanov<br/>Scary by Cafofo</p>\n<p>Sound Effects (CC-BY-SA 3.0):<br/>Churchbell: Copyrght 2008-2010 Ulrich Metzner</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905039e816dfe275e9f7c7922912f635.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Anudin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
