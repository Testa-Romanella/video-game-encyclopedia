Please expect <em>only a few minutes</em> of play time.</p>\n<p>If you try Freepath and have any feedback, I'd be very happy to hear it. Feel free to leave comments here or via twitter @SpinfoamGames.</p>\n<p>(Also please note that links to the EULA and credits for the game are available from the \"More info\" section, in case you'd like to review them.)<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Use the mouse to turn and look, and the WASD keys to move.</p>\n<p>Use the spacebar to jump.</p>\n<p>Escape will pause the game and bring up a menu, from which you can quit back to the title screen.<br/></p>\n<p>You are able to kick off walls, swim, scramble up ledges, and bounce off some objects in mid-air. Experiment to find ways to use and combine these different types of movement to reach various areas of the map.</p>\n<p>There are 10 small statues scattered throughout the prototype -- they are represented by the small diamonds along the top of the screen. While there isn't any notion of \"winning\" or \"completing\" the game at this point, you can try to find and collect all 10 statues.</p>\n<p>The timer displayed in the game does not affect gameplay in anyway, but is there in case you want to challenge yourself to collect all of the items more quickly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T03:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e73/e7349ee95449b5e2627a3db4d1a4619f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spinfoam Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
