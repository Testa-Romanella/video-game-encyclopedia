Charge your jump with space bar and release to jump.</p>\n<p>Hit the switch panels to in the correct order to open the portal. If you hit any other surface, all the switches will reset.</p>\n<p>Get your angles for your last bounce right, and carefully time your jump charges, because you'll lose control of the ball when the portal is open.</p>\n<p>Edit the difficulty to change the size of the portal.</p>\n<p>This was a bit of a rush, so more levels, sound and music etc will be coming soon. Hope you enjoy what's there!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T17:53:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0c/f0c661e262e3e7e7f93daa42a512eecd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ror-2D"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
