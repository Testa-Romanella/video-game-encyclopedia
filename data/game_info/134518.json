Due to the wars and pollution a few hundred years ago, earth is no longer survivable. Thousands of astronauts were sent up towards the galaxy to find a new \u2018home\u2019. Sam currently lives on his space shuttle slowly gathering resources. However, his major problem now is his limited supply of oxygen. Sam enjoys old reruns of television shows because he can get quite lonely in space. He has split up with his family and friends because he got lost during a daily mission. Sam is currently 24 years old and loves to explore the galaxy, but his only weakness is that he is horrible with directions.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/52150661b08269a317730c5e6814b6ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vaughnography"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
