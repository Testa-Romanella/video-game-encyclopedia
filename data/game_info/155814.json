Making it alot harder.</p><p>But don't worry. Fires can be extinguished by clicking on a drop symbol which also randomly appears on the grid.</p><p>However, having fires active increases the points gained from symbols.</p><p>This means you can't just focus on matching the right symbols. You'll also have to keep an eye to the fires &amp; plan your gameplay.</p><p>There are some features implemented to help you...</p><p>\u25cf supermode - activated if you manage to click 10 symbols in a row<br/>\u25cf multiplier symbol - stacks up to 4x.

This will change the location of all symbols &amp; new symbols will appear.<br/>\u25cf Flake symbol - Freezes the current given symbol. Giving you more time to react &amp; match as many of that symbol as possible. Lasts for 5 seconds.<br/>\u25cf Superswitch symbol - If you're lucky you might spot this symbol.
