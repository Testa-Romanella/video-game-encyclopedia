It should also play well on most emulators.\r\n<p>Venture forth on your quest as a lowly lobster imbued with magical powers, determined to inflict lethal damage to whatever stands in your way!<br/></p>\n<p>You start out with a handful of skills allowing you to avoid oncoming obstacles and deal damage, but will use the pearls you collect on your way to unlock more skills, upgrades, and items to push your high score higher and higher.</p>\n<p>This game is an entry for the\u00a0Game Boy Competition 2021.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\nKeyboard\r\nGame Boy\r\nENTER\r\nSTART\r\nTAB\r\nSELECT\r\nZ\r\nA\r\nX\r\nB\r\nARROW KEYS\r\nD-Pad\r\n\r\nGameplay Details:\r\n<p>Press SELECT (TAB) on the status screen to show detailed information about each skill, helping you decide how and when to best use the tools at your disposal for maximum output.</p>\n<p>The A and B (X and Z) buttons are used to activate skills in combat, with the D-Pad used to select which pair of buttons is active. By default the selected pair will stick to the top pair when the D-Pad is released, but this can be disabled on the status screen. Skills may consume your energy, which is constantly refilling, or generate charges, which are consumed by finishers which scale with the number of charges used.<br/></p>\n<p>Several of the skills apply damage-over-time effects to the enemy, time-limited buffs to yourself, or have cooldowns before they can be used again, which are represented by bars on the bottom-left of the game screen.<br/></p>\n<p>The game speed and loadout/items used will be summarized on the game over panel, allowing you to compete with your friends to get the highest score using a specific combination of skills and upgrades!<br/></p>\r\nSource Code:\r\n<p>The full source code is available on github!
