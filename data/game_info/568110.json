This is a platformer where you are a playtester and you need to play it. But, the problem is, the winning and losing thing is broken</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>jump: space or \"w\" or up arrow key\u00a0key\u00a0</p>\n<p>left: \"a\" or up left key</p>\n<p>right: \"d\"or right arrow key</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<p>If you find a level difficult, you can always skip to the next one from the menu.</p>\n<p>The game has 2 states, health and strength. Your strength determines your speed and jump speed, meaning you will get faster and you will jump higher. Your health determines how many hits you can take (As normal).\u00a0The winning and losing thing is broken. So, if you get hit, your health decreases, strength increases. If you kill a enemy, your strength decreases.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are some enemies too, a dark blue angry squares..... dangerous!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are also shooting....pentagons......that stick to the ceiling and shoot, dangerous!!</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0And there are also spikes that also kill you......even though they look smooth.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 There is also yellow water or you can imagine it as lava or something will also kill you.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0The red things are platforms and the one with the cut-out is a jump-thru platform.\u00a0and the grey ones are non-passable.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>As the game is broken, there are invisible platforms, \"jam\" (I will get into it in a sec), spikes, etc..There is also a collectable called \"jam\" which will increase the visibility of the invisible object (meaning you can see them better), increase your health, but the catch is , it will decrease your strength and you will start to see everything blurrier.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you die you will go back to the start but, the progress will be kept (meaning killed enemies will not spawn back in). Good luck!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:28:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/152/1520b1c6731a1a5c1e9d27c9548c36c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Leo Red"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
