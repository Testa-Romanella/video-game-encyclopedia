It's missing most of the features that would have made it interesting but it's a nice baseline RPG system that I can make good later on. The monster was supposed to have a home life in addition to the battle system but I never made it that far.<br/></p><p>There's no sound, no effects, no background art, no tutorial, no damage or status effect indicators, and it's about as balanced as I could make it in 30 minutes. Also you can't die.</p><p>How to play:</p><p>Click the trapezoid under a character to select them, then use the four buttons at the top to pick an action.</p><p>Issues:</p><p>-Resolution issues have been resolved!
