Yes.)<br/>Read on!</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Your mission is to get as many ships to the wooden piers in the top-right corner.</p>\n<p>As many as possible, before time runs out! Each ship scores one point. Simple, eh?</p>\n<p>Ships of course float with the currents .1., which are marked on your map as blue arrows.</p>\n<p>Of course you're not out at sea without a paddle .2., just change the map to suit your needs!</p>\n<p>Simply mouse your 2x2-tile orange-flavoured cursor anywhere on the map to either locally (click left and):<br/>\u00a0- swap sea and land tiles<br/>\u00a0- reverse the currents<br/>\u00a0- rotate the set of tiles clockwise .3.<br/>\u00a0- .. or counterclockwise .3.</p>\n<p>You can scroll through the possible actions with the mousewheel, right mouse-button or arrow keys.<br/>There is quick access with number-keys '1' through '4' as well, for those that don't like loops.<br/>Whatever you do, don't press '5'! (Well ok, fine, because it's you, go ahead.)</p>\n<p>If only it where so simple though ... There is another entity that enjoys as little CHAOS. And also the color purple. Don't we all .4.!<br/>In addition to the other actions, the Jellym... err, 'CHAOS', can also:<br/>\u00a0- completely randomize an area<br/>\u00a0- spawn new ships .5.</p>\n<p>Despite being an entity of chaos however, there are nonetheless certain predictable patterns...<br/>each time the violet bar at the bottom empties out, the action in the lower-left is performed on wherever the mauve cursor is located .6.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Besides the game itself, there are a scant few quality of live things that I managed to get into the game as well:<br/>\u00a0- Press 'T' to view the map from (mostly) the top, instead of in perspective.<br/>\u00a0- Press 'Z' to restart fresh anytime.<br/>\u00a0- Press 'P' to pause the game.<br/>\u00a0- Pesss 'M' to (un)mute the music (not the other sounds ... sorry).</p>\n<p>Finally, tourist mode! Press '5' to take the view .7. from a ship.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>footnotes:<br/>\u00a00) Possibly because the help screens where written in a hurry, before a deadline?<br/>\u00a01) What's this 'wind' thing people keep talking about?<br/>\u00a02) Well, you are, but you're not completely helpless in any case.<br/>\u00a03) Note that the tiles themselve_ are not rotated! Hey I can do serious footnotes as well :-)<br/>\u00a04)\u00a0 ... maybe I should have let the player have the purple color instead. Ah well, live and learn.<br/>\u00a05) Chaos isn't nescesarily evil ... you also depend on it for the highscore!<br/>\u00a06) Now that's purple prose! ... get it? Because I ... wait come back!<br/>\u00a07) Chances are the ships view is directed outside of the map though, so sometimes this is very boring ... especially since I forgot to enlarge the sea and bottom, so the horizon is very close.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:08:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a76/a7648188b42c6e3449201ecd510d587e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["remco"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
