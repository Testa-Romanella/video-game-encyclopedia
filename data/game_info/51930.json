Go ahead!<br/>\r\nHow about a marimba of pops and crackles? Be my guest!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd if you are just the exploring type, the data is beautiful enough to begin with! There is no need to make an instrument, or play it, because in from of you lies a tool for discovering and understanding a beautiful algorithm, and even more beautiful data: Sound<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis project would not be possible without the amazing community of FreeSound.org<br/>\r\nAs well as Kyle McDonald, who scraped audio from freesound.org &amp; made t-SNE embeddings of the data!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCreated during Unity Artist in Residency 2017", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e5c35a437d4bf1944a4d2e2034eb792.jpg", "website": "http://cabbibo.is", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 104}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cabbibo"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cabbibo"], "esrb_rating": null}
