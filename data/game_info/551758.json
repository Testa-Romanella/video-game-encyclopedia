I don't have enough experience using Unity as I use GameMaker Studio 2 as my main development software, so most things you'll see here might seem basic but I'm quite happy with the result, having three weeks to develop all the assets (except for music - I'm not a composer).</p>\n<p>The game doesn't have a win or lose condition, so you'll be trapped in forever (as long as you don't close the browser haha). I didn't have enough time to implement any of it as I'm currently writing this text the day before the deadline.</p>\n<p>I really hope you have fun and like this proof of concept.\u00a0Any feedback will be deeply appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f9/8f9c36434f874fa5c9d601fe4cb634f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Amir Bayareh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
