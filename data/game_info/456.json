It features the best gameplay I&amp;#39;ve found in any mobile turn based strategy game I&amp;#39;ve played to date.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>Yes, there are plenty of laughs to go with your war.

Still, the Great Little War Game is about the fight.<br/><br/>Varied missions are the order of the day here - capture the enemy HQ, escort the Generalissimo to safety, guide small squads behind enemy lines, defend your base...you get the picture. There are 20 missions included, so it&amp;#39;s going to be one crazy ride if you decide you\u2019re brave enough to give them a try.<br/><br/>But fear not, soldier. The Great (and definitely NOT cowardly) Generalissimo is here to save the day, along with his indefatigable aide Jenkins. If the Great Little War doesn&amp;#39;t get to you, their puns and hi-jinks certainly will.<br/><br/><br/>What are waiting for?
