As a member of one of these factions, it is your job to\r\nlead it to victory. Along the way, you must build up you city, raise\r\nand command an army, and take control of the lands. \r\n</p>\n<p>This\r\ngame is played somewhat like a real-time strategy, but from the first\r\nperson view. You are not only a leader, but a solider on the front\r\nlines. And to win, you must do well at both.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: WASD</p>\n<p>Rotate View: Mouse</p>\n<p>Command NPC to follow: Left Shift</p>\n<p>Open village control HUD: Tab</p>\n<p>Pause: Escape</p>\n\n<p>That\r\nall being said, this game is definitely still in development.  Many\r\nof the core mechanics, such as map generation and the GUI are fairly\r\nstable, many other items are not.

(Haha!)

Feel free to post that and whatever aspects you find the funniest...I may\r\nkeep them in an optional \u201cUnintended Feature Mode\u201d just for fun\r\nas I fix them later on!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73d/73d3c3aa49e298d9cb1e4f6b73ff4c8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jeffrey Sardina"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
