It's going to be an online multiplayer smash stuff up fest where you throw things at each other. The current test build should work on both oculus and vive kits (requires tracked controllers) and features single player only with no damage model. Just jump in and throw stuff around to the looping music playing on the office PA.\u00a0 I'm putting this up for preview because I can't test on a vive and I also have a 1080ti so I\u00a0want to test on a range of rigs, so if you play it can you please let me know your specs and how well it ran.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>grip: pick up objects</p>\n<p>Trigger: make controllers have physical weight/Use item in hand</p>\n<p>thumbstick/pad press: Activate teleport movement</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e3255504964d75545280222e45a2fbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UberWiggett"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
