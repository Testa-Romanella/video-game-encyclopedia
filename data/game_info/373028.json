The bots are built in a way to offer the user a great deal of control while also allowing them to be autonomous. Because of how many enemies are in each mission, you must \"rely\" on your bots to help you succeed. Improve your bots with different stats and modifications so that they can better assist you and make use of the many different commands that can be given.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T06:25:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/068/068628f226ce2c586ae508e151a1701d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["baconation"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
