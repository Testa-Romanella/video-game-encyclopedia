First, the player is shown a picture of the chemical structure. Subsequently, the player must replicate the chemical structure that was shown within a time limit displayed by a blue bar. The player must also place shapes within a time limit shown with a green bar on the side, or a random piece gets placed. Sometimes the random piece can be helpful or detrimental to the player. Players are awarded bonus points for completing chemical structures correctly, quickly, and by using shapes that are generally difficult to use, such as the triangle. Once the player completes all 13 chemical structures, they get a final score that they can share with their friends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T13:46:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fb/6fb3046db6b8efba2519afe4c07d049f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Flying_Raccon"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
