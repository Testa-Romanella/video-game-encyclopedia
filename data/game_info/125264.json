This was made for Nadia Nova's Trans Gal Jam 2! I wanted to make something a bit lighthearted for a change, and I hope y'all like it, even if I did rush it a little in the end. Please enjoy and do chip in if you can afford it. I'd love to make more of these.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b7/8b73fd6e53a5bd618dd7faf65bef17b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
