Duke it out with up to four critters, and call in powerful supporting strikes from your human companions!<br/>Play as the mighty warriors\u00a0<strong>ANT</strong>,\u00a0<strong>SPIDER</strong>,\u00a0<strong>MANTIS</strong>,\u00a0<strong>STAG</strong>... and more???</p>\n<p>This game was originally made for LOWREZJAM 2021 with the theme \"Minibeasts\", and the challenge being made to make a game with 64x64 pixels. I've blown it up a bit so that you can tell what's going on, I hope that's alright.<br/>It didn't win anything, by the way, because the jam was based on the premise that people who participated in it would play and vote on loads of other people's entries and it got played by about 3 people in the end.<br/>Not that\u00a0I'm bitter or anything, couldn't be me.<br/>Ah well, not like\u00a0I expected to get anything really. That jam was packed with some incredible games, I just had fun participating.\u00a0It's the most I ever felt like a true and honest game developer.<br/>How do\u00a0I get\u00a01/5 for \"adhering to the theme\" though,\u00a0everyone was blowing up their games to make them viewable, so what's up with that there was no restriction on colour palettes or anything come on</p>\n<p>Understandably Itsy Bitsy Cuffs had some limits to its screenspace and it got a bit frantic. I still think it's very quick, good fun, anyway.</p>\n<p>Directions on how to play are included below. Unfortunately re-binding controls was completely out of scope for this project, so I recommend playing with a gamepad.</p>\n<p>Supports up to 2 players on the same keyboard, and up to 4 players total.</p>\n<p>Music is AI-generated so don't judge it too harshly please, it's doing its best.</p>\n<p>Stag STRONG.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>///CONTROLS///</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>-MOVE<br/></strong><strong>Gamepad:<br/></strong>Left Stick / D-Pad<br/><strong>Keyboard 1:</strong><br/>WASD<br/><strong>Keyboard 2:<br/></strong>Arrow Keys</p>\n<p><strong>-PRIMARY ATTACK<br/></strong><strong>Gamepad: </strong>A / Y<br/><strong>Keyboard 1: </strong>Spacebar / J / Q<br/><strong>Keyboard 2: </strong>Numpad 0 / Z / Enter</p>\n<p><strong>-SECONDARY ATTACK<br/></strong><strong>Gamepad:</strong> B / X<br/><strong>Keyboard 1:</strong> E / K<br/><strong>Keyboard 2:</strong> Numpad Enter / X</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>-HUMAN ASSIST<br/></strong><strong>Gamepad:</strong> Select<br/><strong>Keyboard 1: </strong>R / U<br/><strong>Keyboard 2:</strong> Numpad + / C</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong><em>///BASE ROSTER///</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>-ANT<br/></strong><strong>Primary: </strong>Rock Toss.<br/>You can move while throwing rocks and keep throwing in the same direction.<br/><strong>Secondary:</strong> Rock Block.<br/>You can attack in melee with your rock, or hold it in to guard against attacks in front of you.
