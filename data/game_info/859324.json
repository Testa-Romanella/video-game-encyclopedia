Have fun!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>DogGameJam:\u00a0</strong>I\u00a0made this game\u00a0in about a week\u00a0for #DogGameJam. In this game jam, participants are given a model to use as the main character. The model is of a half-husky half-wolf dog named Rodney. I\u00a0modified it by anthropomorphizing it and stylizing it into a low-poly middle-aged dog, and wanted to explore this middle season of life that I am going through.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>: Unity, Blender, Gimp, Audacity</p>\n<p>List of 3rd Party Assets/Attributions</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T18:14:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/248/248e586d085b7a40e44f872d3424e936.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["andyman404"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
