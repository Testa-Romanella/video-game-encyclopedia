The food is hidden but the agents all see the same food item, leading to a mixture of random and coordinated movements across the screen. The agents were trained on a smaller 5x5 grid, which is what they continue to see, repeated across the canvas.</p><p>https://github.com/Henry-E/snake-visualisation<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/922/9222c16a7d3970ae3b4452c922edda15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["henry-e"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
