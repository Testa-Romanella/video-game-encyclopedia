Power Pushers is a racing game with no accelerator in sight. Cars will not budge without a literal push from the player, which must be aimed at with the left and right triggers to get the best angle for maximum distance. After you push the car, the player must chase after it to get another push closer to the finish. The player\u2019s goal is to push their car to the finish line while avoiding hazards like walls or grass in the fastest time possible. There is also a 1v1 race mode for multiplayer action. You\u2019re free to interrupt the other player\u2019s car if you want to be THAT guy.<br/><br/>***Controls***<br/>**Please Have Controllers Connected Before Opening the Program<br/>A controller is REQUIRED to play Power Pushers<br/>Left Stick: Move Character<br/>Action Button: Push Car<br/><br/>*Action Button is \"A\" on Xbox family of controllers, \"X\" on Playstation family of controllers*</p>\n<p>**To Select 1Player or 2Player modes**</p>\n<p>Push your car over the text of your desired mode</p>\n<p>In order to play 2 Player mode, both players must place their cars on the text</p>\n<p>***Download Instructions***<br/><br/>Download Installer - and follow the prompts<br/><br/><br/>Tools of Choice:<br/><br/>Game Maker Studio 1.4.6<br/><br/>Aseprite - https://www.aseprite.org/<br/><br/>Adobe Photoshop<br/><br/>Movie Studios Platinum<br/>Resources:<br/>General Font: DPComic - https://www.1001fonts.com/dpcomic-font.html<br/>Win Sound: https://freesound.org/people/Killersmurf96/sounds/423081/<br/><br/>Running Sound: https://freesound.org/people/Disagree/sounds/433725/<br/>Car Pushed Sound: https://freesound.org/people/Halleck/sounds/19326/<br/><br/>Music: [Sky Wanderer - playonloop]<br/><br/>*We possess a licence for this track. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d48/d48c90fc37fed496c0e61dee72b5692b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steven Burton"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
