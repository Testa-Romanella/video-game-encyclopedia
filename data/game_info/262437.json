{"id": 262437, "slug": "skatebird", "name": "SkateBIRD", "name_original": "SkateBIRD", "description": "<p>Drop in, and be a skateboarding bird. Grind on bendy straws, kickflip over staplers, and carve killer lines through cardboard and sticky tape parks. Skate an expansively tiny world with simple controls even a Hawk named Tony would dig.<br />\nHere&#39;s the deal: you&#39;re lonely, and your Big Friend has hung up their board for good. Their job sucks. You&#39;re gonna fix all that with the power of being a chill little skateboarding bird, though. You may be tiny, and alone, but the more you skate, the more following you get on Tweeter (the premier bird social network) - the more the cozy world of bird skating will open up. You&#39;ll make friends, birds will come check out your park, and maybe you&#39;ll even host events! Above all else, skate birds just try really hard.<br />\nDrive smooth flowing, physical-feeling skating with simple buttons, not stick gestures<br />\nFeel immediately at home with the controls, if you dig Pro Skaters of a Hawk variety<br />\nExplore a series of tiny worlds full of little objectives and secret tapes (scotch tapes mostly)<br />\nMake bird friends by completing challenges, or just trying really hard<br />\nOrganize skate events with your new friends! Become a skate bird legend!<br />\n(or just be really happy all your buds are having a good time with you)</p>", "metacritic": 59, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-15T12:42:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/687/687dba2775a86b54ec90b32005857135.jpg", "website": "http://www.skatebird.com", "rating": 2.04, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 457, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 68}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 65, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 67, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Glass Bottom Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Glass Bottom Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
