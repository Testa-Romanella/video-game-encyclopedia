Avoid collisions as much as possible and fight off the incoming police vehicles for as long as you can. Don't forget to grab all the power-ups you see in order to help you. Beat your previous high score in two different maps!</p>\n<p>For best experience, download on Android via the Play Store.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Use your two thumbs to press the left and right side halves of the screen to move</li><li>For PC, use A and D or Left and Right arrows to move</li><li>When rocket launcher is deployed, press Space button or the button on the screen to shoot</li><li>Press the Escape button or the Stop sign on the screen to pause the game</li></ul>\n\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>The game also has two kinds of maps. One with eight lanes and one with four. The eight-lane map is a normal city highway and is the easy version. One thing to be careful is the lights in the middle of the lanes. This could be used for the advantage of the player to avoid police cars.\u00a0The desert map is harder due a to more dense and narrow highway. Avoiding police cars will be more challenging, but there is a short leeway on the dirt for the player to make quick maneuvers if needed, without hitting the palm trees;</p>\n<p>Other key-takeaways is that the when the player collides with the trucks, lights and trees, game is over. Trucks are obstacles but could also be used to avoid police or other car accidents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overall, there are more things to learn, but those are up to you to find out. Enjoy gameplay on PC and Android!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:59:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e8/6e8993bc8542b60d77b89b85fd2331fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["George540"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
