This way the\u00a0tree can be saved. Once the fire has been lit for a certain amount of time, the tree will be destroyed and cannot be saved anymore (turns grey) .</li><li>You loose when more than 50% of the forest have been destroyed.</li></ul>\r\nControl\r\n<ul><li><strong>Left mouse button:</strong> click and hold on the passing clouds when they are above a fire to extinguish it\r\n</li><li><strong>Right mouse button:</strong>  when changing wind direction is available (blue/green loading bar at  top of window), hold, drag and release to change wind direction.<ul><li><strong>Alternative</strong>: you can also click on green \"change wind\" sign (when visible) in top info bar and then drag and drop for new direction. This might especially be helpful on <strong>mobile devices</strong> as there is no right mouse button there.</li></ul></li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Midjourney-Bot for the background and title image<br/></li></ul>\n<p>Note: I've changed the color of the fires from red to orange in order to make it more accessible for color blind people. Hope this helps :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T10:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/707/707d73d9178076482218fc3f78310dd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bacaar"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
