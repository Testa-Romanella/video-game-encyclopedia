Virtual Instrument is specifically designed for the Oculus Quest 2.\u00a0\u00a0Other devices and Steam VR may not be compatible with this program. Support for controllers is not included; hand tracking is enabled by default. You must have hand tracking enabled in your Quest's settings.</p>\n<p>2. You will need a way to sideload the application onto your Quest 2. I personally use SideQuest. You will need an Oculus Developer account for this. (Making an account is free. I also recommend browsing other games on SideQuest- there's a lot more variety there than on the Oculus Store.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Download the .apk file to your Quest 2 using your sideloader. If you're using SideQuest, it's the box with a down arrow at the top right. Once downloaded, the program should be playable, and it should be labeled \"OculusMusic\" on your device (I should change this...)</p>\n\n<p>Known Issues: There is a bug where there's no sound when you press a button; try restarting your Quest 2.</p>\n<p>Possible Future Updates: Ability to move the instrument around (the box may be placed too low for some people), Point-and-click locomotion, more sounds/buttons, and ways to distort sounds!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:54:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/436/4364871f40bc3c2288203fd3ac731ef2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mbg180"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
