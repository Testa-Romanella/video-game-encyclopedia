The currency and trade system consists on selling the collected scrap and exchange it for\u00a0<em>\"gears</em>\" (the currency within the game). The place where these mechanics will be carried out it's going to be a kind of hangar.<strong>\u00a0(To be Implemented)</strong></p>\n<p>The player will be able to gain speed, resistance against impacts, more load capacity inside the ship and more fuel thanks to these upgrades.</p>\n<p>Within the game there will be different types of space scrap, each type provides different amounts of\u00a0<em>\"gears</em>\" and varied materials.</p>\n<p>These types are:</p>\n<p>- Payloads: It is very hard to find. They have very rare materials and the highest value in \"<em>g</em>ears\".</p>\n<p>- Rockets: Fairly fast space scrap. They provide some rare materials, high value in\u00a0<em>\"gears</em>\".</p>\n<p>- Debris: Their movement speed is slow . These do not have materials, since the player can find them everywhere they're the easiest way to get\u00a0<em>\"gears</em>\".</p>\n<p>The materials that can be obtained are log nuts, screws, reinforced plates and high tech scrap.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Special scrap and interesting information:</strong></li></ul>\n<p>The special scrap it's a kind of scrap when collected within the game a GUI pop up will apear with real information and data of the object, such as: Where it came from? What it is? Its name and its speed, for example. All this information will be the same that NASA has on its official website:\u00a0https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/spacebirds\u00a0.<strong>\u00a0(To be Implemented)</strong></p>\n<p>There will be a limited amount of these special scrap, being placed at random points on the map, each of them containing different and specific information on a particular type of scrap.</p>\n<p>They are collectible, giving the player another reason to explore and be interested in the issue at hand.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Risks to the player:</strong></li></ul>\n<p>The player may get hit by asteroids or some particular clusters of debris that will damage his ship, losing some part of the cargo or even causing his death.</p>\n<p>If he gets hit and dies the player will lose all the scrap previously collected and will respawn inside the hangar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T03:01:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fc/8fc6a54179f75537609ea697747ae775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["brunomir"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
