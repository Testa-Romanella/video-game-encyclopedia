I\u2019ve added some features like settings, shops, skins and scores. The system saves the counting of the money so if you quit you don't lose your progresses.<br/></p>\n<p>If you will find a bug please leave a comment and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Please leave a review of the game and your experience.
