This is not a finished game, see it as a demo! We are aware that it is filled with bugs and the combat is in need of balancing, we simply didn't have time to playtest it. I actually hadn't even played through it once at the time of submitting o_o</p>\n<p><strong>How to combat:\u00a0Open the menu, select your weapon, move the red box onto an enemy, and confirm. Bows have longer range but less accuracy. I know the combat is quite wonky in this state but in the future it will be more strategy-based!</strong></p>\n<p>There are 9 sheep in total that you have to find. Return them all to the fence area (top left corner of the map) to beat the game!</p>\n<p><strong>Still missing one of the sheep?
