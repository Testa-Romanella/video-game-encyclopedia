As the title states, it's a simple board game. It's not a finished product by any means and rather it was more of a learning project revolving around path-finding and grid-based movement (somewhat like Chess).</p>\n<p>This is a multiplayer game meant to be played on one device. Play until an opponent has run out of characters to control.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:11:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9e30afe5bf2dd54aad5afd239e00d93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["and one"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
