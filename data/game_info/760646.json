It is almost complete and I just need to add the death screen and start screen with some game instructions on how to play it. It is a pretty small game for now but as I progress in learning more, I might try to upgrade on some more details. As of now, there is some basic functionality such as changing and using weapon and\u00a0magic spells, fighting two bosses, one working upgrade menu system. The map is quite small but eventually might grow to an infinite map with missions and some other bosses to play with. This is the game which I enjoyed making the most and I am fully dedicated to progress upon it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-23T18:57:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d2/1d27f40d98bcde4b50a024a6c8b10bb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TITAN GAMER"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
