You are given cards at the beginning of each shift and have to manage the reactor with them. This was heavily inspired by quill 18's game for Ludum dare 48(ldj.am/$241226).</p>\n<p>P.S did not have enough time to add a tutorial, therefore....</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>-Press escape to close</p>\n<p>-Click a card to use</p>\n<p>-Different cards provide different things(Battery uses fuel to make power, uranium adds fuel, coffee adds energy, snowflakes cool the reactor, draw gives extra cards(up to 7 in a hand), operator can be any)</p>\n<p>-Temperature of reactor cannot go above 100% or its immediate loss.</p>\n<p>-Power produced is dependent on heat(has to be above 10% heat), the higher the heat the more the power</p>\n<p>-Making power generates random amount of heat based on fuel grade(the higher the grade, the less random)</p>\n<p>-The x's tell how many days you can go without providing power</p>\n<p>-Energy is used when a card is clicked. The number at the top left dictates how much</p>\n<p>-The number at the top right of the card is the level. A level two uranium adds two fuel, power two battery uses two fuel, etc...</p>\n<p>-A daily quota must be filled or its considered no power for the day. The daily quota is generated randomly.</p>\n<p>-Top left dictates current score.</p>\n<p>-End shift gives a new hand and replenishes energy back to 3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T04:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b2/5b2cd43a270ab3f4c0cc7d75444ad0f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["skelyvelocirap"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
