The ball also reacts to the speed of each player.\u00a0It is set on a sci-fi theme but kept simple for its retro aspect. I hope you enjoy it!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>My technical goals were to learn the following about the game dev process from start to finish in Unity, a bit of everything:\u00a0UI, music, sound, animation, movement, code, and packaging. Let me know if you find any bugs or have issues running this on your computer. I\u00a0know there is more I\u00a0can learn from this project.</p>\n<p><strong>Control:</strong></p>\n<p>Player 1 (left) : W and S to move up and down</p>\n<p>Player 2 (right): UpArrow and DownArrow to move up and down</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T07:08:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2f/a2f15847527d714523c7bf2b9b36cf91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dragonar25"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
