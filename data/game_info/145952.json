The challenge of flying your way through the <strong>levels </strong>was made exciting and fun thanks to an physics &amp; level design.<br/><br/>The <strong>fuel </strong>that powers the ship is <strong>limited</strong>, and the <strong>energy </strong>of the ship will <strong>go down</strong> on each <strong>collision</strong>. Dealing with the fuel consumption and the ship's life condition, the player must fly through 24 levels, avoid walls &amp; traps, collect some special items and then <strong>land properly</strong>.\u00a0<br/><br/>Artistically speaking, the <strong>visuals </strong>are not meant to be ultra-realistic. A <strong>simple cartoonish color scheme</strong> was developed.<br/>The game itself happens in a <strong>2D play-field</strong>, and the visuals are all handled in 3D, offering a depth experience that make it more compelling but does not overwhelm the gameplay.</p>\n<p><em>This game was developed during the years 2011-2012, inspired by the feedbacks &amp; energy of the amazing <strong>TigSource</strong> community. The development is currently paused.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6dc9df018383d5b86bfeb40996c2bea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["astrofra"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
