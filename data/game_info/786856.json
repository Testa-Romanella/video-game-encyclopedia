The only caveat is when you reap souls too early, the remaining years of their life is taken from your SOUL FORCE.<br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when in a hurry to leave your house, you forgot your Soul Detector 3000 TM so you can't tell exactly how much life people have left in them. Use your otherworldly sight to reap people on the verge of death. The blacker their soul, the closer they are to death.</p>\n<p>If the world becomes too full of LINGERING SOULS, the big boss is going to be angry and it's game over.\u00a0\u00a0If you reap younger people, it takes more from your SOUL FORCE, if it depletes to 0, it's game over.<br/></p>\n<p>Rules:</p>\n<p>If the total age of LINGERING SOULS\u00a0(unreaped souls)\u00a0becomes more than 1,500 years, game over! (If the right meter fills to 100%, game over.)</p>\n<p>If your SOUL FORCE\u00a0 becomes 0 (reap people closer to death to receive less damage), game over! (If the left bar goes to 0%, game over.) The blacker the sillouette, the closer to death.</p>\n<p>Everyone is damned if you do and damned if you don't, but let's reap as efficiently as possible!\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD, Arrow Keys, DPad to move.<br/>SPACE, Right Click, Gamepad button is the ACTION and ATTACK button.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/>Coding, Game, Design, and some art:\u00a0Gray Hato<br/>Grim Reaper:\u00a0Segal2D<br/>Human Sprites: Megatiles (Itch.io profile, check him out!)<br/>Main Theme: cyberleafstudio.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:52:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/3620759af75ac4ae7b2898937b4d5357.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gray Hato"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
