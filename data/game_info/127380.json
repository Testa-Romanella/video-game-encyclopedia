Collect 10 gems to reach the rhythm based boss level. We want to add more to the boss level in the future to make it more challenging but for now the player just collects the meat to beat the boss.</p><p>In a later build after completing a boss level we would move you on to stage 2 but for now the game just loops you back into the original runner scene but with different levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d30/d3026b4162d1fdf38e5b9da4aab87d97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zacerhy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
