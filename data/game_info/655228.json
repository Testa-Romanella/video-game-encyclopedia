Get on the yellow cube/platform without dying. Other cubes along the way may decide your fate. Take the purple cube for example. There is a random chance they will either kill you or make a nice passage for you without any obstacles. Will you take the chance with them? Or will you take the long way roundabout? Then you have pink cubes, they hurt you, don't touch them... If you touch the pink cubes too many times, you will die. Next we have the red cubes, they are a real prankster, who needs colliders they say? That's right if you try to slide across them, you will fall into the void. Finally we have the semi-transparent orange cubes, they will give you a boost upwards. Which colored cubes will you use to ensure victory? Download the game and find out...</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Made For the Summer Harvest Jam 2</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e6e21f06a882393f09121d79a57cd4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DeepDownGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
