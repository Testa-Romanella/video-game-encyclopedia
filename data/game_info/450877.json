(While remaining safe indoors.)<br/><br/>Why not strap some elastic around your waist and avoid being pulled towards somebody seriously infected!<br/><br/>Avoid, infect, or seriously inconvenience your friends with this twin stick, topically relevant, local multiplayer (don't forget about Steam Remote Play!) party game. Each stick controls a poor soul who just wants to be left alone, to get away from the possibly infected, and to completely and utterly avoid those with obvious symptoms. At least they get to travel through different areas, play football, watch a logistical masterpiece of package delivery, and hoard an obscene amount of toilet paper.<br/><br/>If your friends are stuck in another building, and stuck without Steam, or worse - stuck without internet - not to fret, because you get, an isolation modette. Play vs. the AI, or see how long you can last against someone with a serious shopping habit.<br/><br/>*** HOW TO PLAY ***<br/>There are two teams - orange and blue. Each team has two willing participants, desperate for some alone time. Each participant is controlled by an analog stick (or WASD/arrows). Each participant is also  connected to an infected person in the middle of the field by an elastic rope which pulls each body to the middle. If you get too close, you may become infected, too.<br/><br/>Your job is to a) avoid the infected person in the middle, b) push your opponents into the middle using either your attacks or your big cough so that they become infected, and c) avoid the infected opponents. If your opponents are all infected and you can survive for ten seconds without also becoming infected, you win!<br/><br/>Each map has different attributes, and there are pickups that have different effects, ranging from invulnerability to extra strength and speed. There is also some toilet paper to wipe up your messes.<br/><br/>Best of luck, be safe, don't pick up the hearts.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T03:22:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b0/7b0c7938904da23099b30cb92c8d75fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thenewtropic", "Daniel Lewis"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TheNewTropic"], "esrb_rating": null}
