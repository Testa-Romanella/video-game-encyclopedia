Level 3 is easier and very fun (you'll see why)</p>\n<p>So hey play and please leave a feedback as this is my first solo game and I would love to hear some ~brain vomits~ about it! &lt;3\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T07:39:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d79/d7982cf9bdf781b8512b2e7e81a30adc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hazyapple"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
