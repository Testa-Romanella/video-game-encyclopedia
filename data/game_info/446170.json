Life was nice and happy in the village, until one day, awakened by some magical mistake, the Evil One started to spread his minions around town, performing hideous acts against the people. The worst of which was the kidnapping of Brunilde. She was torn from Rufus\u2019 hands and put in a prison at the Evil One\u2019s castle. Transformed into a blondie duck-faced doll girl, she now spends all her time staring at herself in a small handheld mirror.<br/><br/>Determined to win her back, Rufus made a helmet out of a bucket and picked a broom as a weapon.
