Reclaim the wasteland.<br/></p>\r\nA reverse city builder\r\n<p>Use advanced eco-technology to purify the soil, creating plains, wetlands, beaches, rainforests, wildflowers, and more\u2014then efficiently recycle everything you've built, leaving the environment pristine for its new animal inhabitants.<br/></p>\r\nDifferent maps every time\r\n<p>Procedurally generated landscapes mean no two playthroughs of Terra Nil will ever be the same.
