If you're here to play the game, the download links are down below for Windows and Mac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>RunSpeed is a 3D speedrunning game I tried to make in 3.14 (\u03c0) days.

So, the game you see below wasn't made over the course of 3 days. But it's still cool and I would rather\u00a0you guys to play the finished version with cool GUI effects and stuff.
