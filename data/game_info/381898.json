{"id": 381898, "slug": "ld45-re-world", "name": "LD45 - Re-World", "name_original": "LD45 - Re-World", "description": "<p>In ReWorld you play - once again - our young dragon Kurisou.</p>\n<p>This time, however, he is not trapped in a maze, but trying to find his way out of an escape room. You will find yourself in a world without color, sound or light.</p>\n<p>Your task is\u00a0 as simple as leaving the room. You will need to play with color an gravity to solve puzzles.<br/>Note: You might find cards which are not needed in the levels as well as cards which might lead you into confusion. We follow one basic rule: What is layed down, is sticky.</p>\n<p>Jump in and try it yourself. Tutorial included.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD/Arrows or left stick/DPAD for movement<br/>E/F/Right ctrl or A/Button 1 for Interaction (Card pickup etc)<br/>hold Esc or B/Button 2 for giving up</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<ul><li>HINTS:<br/>- \"Mixed\" lasers (e.g. green &amp; red) will look wrong, when the environment is tinted in single colors. REMEBER their color! THIS IS SUPPOSED BEHAVIOR!<br/>- You do not need to put ALL cards on the table! Sometimes there are more than you need, also sound as well as mob cards do not change anything relevant (except they can save your life)<br/>- USe cards in the right order. You could lokc yourself in or out else (a blue laser can'T be disabled after a red card has been placed)<br/>- This is a puzzle game - expect the unexpected.<br/>- *Use your brain.*</li></ul>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>If you happen to envounter any bugs please let us know!
