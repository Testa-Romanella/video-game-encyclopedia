The game became the second in the series Doom, received improved multiplayer, graphics and improved optimization.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise game is not so different from its predecessor. The developers decided to take advantage of the progress of the computer hardware to fine-tune their game engine. The player still took control of the nameless space marine, which traveled through 30 non-linear levels. A level is considered to be completed after the player finds the coded doors. A rich arsenal of weapons and a variety of models of enemies will not get bored.</p>\n<p>The plot continues the story of the first part: after defeating the invasion of demons on the moons of Mars and returning from Hell, the protagonist finds the Earth captured by the creatures that he just conquered. A solo company can be fashioned alone, and in multiplayer, to battle with friends today: for the game, there is a huge amount of third-party mods to play online without using of archaic dial-up connection.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "1994-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T21:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/38a/38af969459ad6e5de116ec8a4a84218c.jpg", "website": "https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en", "rating": 4.38, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 117, "owned": 2085, "beaten": 630, "toplay": 64, "dropped": 206, "playing": 36}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 690, "suggestions_count": 436, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 694, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "iOS", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "Game Boy Advance", "Classic Macintosh", "Android", "macOS", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Bethesda Softworks", "id Software", "Nerve Software", "Lion Entertainment", "Infinity", "Torus Games", "MachineWorks Northwest"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Valve", "Bethesda Softworks", "Activision Blizzard", "Activison", "id Software", "GT Interactive Software", "Virgin Interactive", "GT Interactive", "Imagineer", "CDV Software"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
