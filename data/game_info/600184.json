Attack the city. Destroy structures and fight humanity!\r\n</p>\r\nThe controls\r\n<p>The game is developed for the Oculus Rift S headset, both controllers are used for the game.</p>\n<p>Grab objects by using the side buttons!</p>\n<p>Punch buildings by holding the side buttons!</p>\n<p>Move around using the left thumbstick!</p>\n<p>Look around using both the headset and right thumbstick!</p>\n<p>Jump using the \"A\" button on the right controller!</p>\n<p>Look in the options menu for anti-sickness measures if needed!</p>\r\nYour goal\u00a0\r\n<p>Smash the cities by any means necessary!\r\n  </p>\n<p>The more creative the destruction the more points you get. Humanity is not going to let you destroy its cities without a fight so prepare to use a variety of techniques to destroy as much as possible!\r\n  </p>\n<p>While civilians may have escaped before trapping you within a force field, there are still vehicles sitting around just waiting to be used!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Then there are the pylons scattered around the cities. Use these like a bat or just throw them to cause more destruction!</p>\r\nThe team\r\n<p><strong>Ben Chittenden</strong> - He's the mastermind behind the code and initial vision of the game. Granted when he's not stuck coding he's always watching some sort of superhero movie!</p>\n<p>Links:\u00a0https://twitter.com/ABritishGameDev</p>\n<p><strong>Joshua Couchman</strong> - He's the man behind the level and sound design.\u00a0 If you can't find him working on video games, he's probably playing them!</p>\n<p>Links:\u00a0https://twitter.com/TheJoshhyyy</p>\n<p>https://joshhyyy.itch.io/</p>\n\n<p>The game was made for the final project of our last university assignment with help and advice from a few external people throughout the time of the assignment.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game is still in development but we will be taking a break for a while from the game after its release.
