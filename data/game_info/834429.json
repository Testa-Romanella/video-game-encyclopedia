I thought that posting it here and sharing links will inspire me to work further on the game. It is quite bare bones at the moment. I welcome all criticism. I've been staring at it for so long that its hard to see which parts aren't working.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There isn't really any \"end game\" as of yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things I want to add:</p>\n<p>- There are currently the beginnings of NPC questlines for 2/3 NPCs. I want to fully flesh these out and add more</p>\n<p>- I currently have 1 full scale \"quest\" that you can take. I want to make many many more.</p>\n<p>- Many many many many more random events</p>\n<p>- Combat system is hella basic, but I don't really want it to be a combat focused game. If you have any ideas, feel free to share.</p>\n<p>- I am working on a trades system. So becoming an innkeeper, herbalist, court wizard, blacksmith, etc.</p>\n<p>- Currently the companions don't do much. Eventually they will augment your combat stats, and let you do unique things.</p>\n\n<p>I have set up an e-mail for feedback: stone.app.systems@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Please feel free to send any and all feedback.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T12:37:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b1/0b172876bada6d359b30f1302905f15d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StoneApp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
