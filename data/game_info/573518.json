You don't get paid enough to put up with this! Go go go!\r\nControls:\u00a0 \r\nArrow keys to move.\r\nZ to start game.\r\nEscape key will open a small menu where you can click a restart option.\r\nAbout the author:\r\nHello! I'm Kouda, a first year, mature student at Manchester Metropolitan University, studying games technology.\u00a0 \r\nWe just started to learn LUA via the TIC-80 games engine a couple of weeks ago. I wanted practise and thought I'd use it for this games jam! I had a lot of fun making it. \r\nI hope whoever plays this enjoys :D \r\nTwitter: @Kouda_Ha\r\nWhat I learned/self reflection:\r\nI tried to make the office as varied as possible, which was very hard with the limited amount of pixels and colours, so it mainly forced me to have a bigger imagination that I thought I had lol.\r\nThe same with the characters, I tried to make a normal office worker/cleaner with a blue facemask (Player) and the Antimasker I wanted to be a bit like a smelly zombie because the main premise is they infect you if you're caught. I had to change the Antimasker a lot as I used too many pixels for the smelly lines look and when it ran around it just looked like a green blob, now they're more humanoid and with minimal (but still effectively gross looking) stink lines lol.<p>(Not really an Easter Egg but I love Daruma, and the AI \"Antimasker\" was making it get stuck in a 1x1 gap, so I made a 1x2 Daruma and put him there to stop the AI getting stuck, and who doesn't want an office Daruma?!? Nobody that's who!)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T05:34:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35d/35dc192c371127b12d1f6e1078ce1332.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kouda Ha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
