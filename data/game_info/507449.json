Who's stronger? Defend your Bread monument at all costs, and do your best to destroy your opponent's one.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Selection is done by mouse like in any RTS game. Other controls are purely hotkey-based.</p>\n<p>When some units are selected, issue a \"Move\" order to them by right-clicking anywhere. You can also issue \"Attack-Move\" by pressing \"A\" then left-clicking.</p>\n<p>Buildings are given orders by hotkeys seen on the tooltips.</p>\n<p>Use mouse-wheel to scroll the map. F1 or Home will bring the camera to your base, while F4 or End will move it to the enemy's base.</p>\n<p>Holding ALT will show all entities' health-bars</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>Breadforce is the main resource of your tribe.</p>\n<p>The Monument slowly produces some Breadforce.\u00a0Send your idle tribesmen to pray the God (by right-clicking on the monument), and they will significantly increase the income. You can eventually upgrade the Monument so it will produce even more Breadforce per cycle.</p>\n<p>The Cave is a house for your tribesmen. You can produce new units there and also upgrade it, which will give more space for new tribesmen and also increase the further unit-production speed.</p>\n<p>Firstly, only Clubmen are available. They are close-combat units. You can later research Stone Masters, which are ranged units.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS:</strong></p>\n<p>1) If you sent a unit to pray already, don't right-click the monument again, the unit will stuck. If this happened, move it slightly away (right-click) and then send to pray again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:40:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/633/633053ac5fad38870f26cd9984fe3cff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Amegatron"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
