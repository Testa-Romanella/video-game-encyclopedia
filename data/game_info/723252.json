Keys are limited and you need to find 3 types - Metal for metal doors, Wood for wooden doors &amp; Tech keys for the later tech doors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Doors open automatically if you have a correct key in your rucksack - simply run into the door.</p>\n<p>Your Rucksack is important too, as you only have 5 spaces, and so you may have to drop an item to make room for another - you decide ;)</p>\n<p>Screen sizes are not fully supported as it's so old, and so the game may appear slighty 'letter-boxed'. It won't affect the game in any way.</p>\n<p>Oh and the game is fully unlocked - you can choose any level to play, though it's obviously better if you follow the storyline as it will make more sense as you progress.<br/></p>\n<p>Well that's it - I hope some gamers out there enjoy Tommy Tronic and taking a nostaligic trip back to the old days.</p>\n<p><strong>All funds go towards convincing me to make a really kick ass remake :)</strong></p>\n<p>Let me know your thoughts!</p>\n\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls can be set to your tastes via the menu:<br/></p>\n<p>Standard keys are:</p>\n<p>Move/Jump: arrow keys</p>\n<p>To collect an item for your Rucksack\u00a0you must crouch while standing over it, automatically adding it to your inventory.<br/></p>\n<p>Use an item in your rucksack (max 5 items so choose/use wisely): space bar</p>\n<p>Cycle through rucksack '[' &amp;']' keys</p>\n<p>To drop an item from your Rucksack, make sure it is visible in your Rucksack Panel and then press \"d\"<br/></p>\n<p>Toggle weapons: '&lt;' &amp; '&gt;' keys</p>\n<p>You can see which control keys are set by pressing: 'h' (change them in the\u00a0menu)</p>\n<p><em>Joypad: If your Joypad is detected you can change the control settings in the controls screen.
