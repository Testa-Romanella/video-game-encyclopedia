Of 24 great contributions, this game ended up as number 7 in the competition.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>THE STORY SO FAR</strong></p>\n<p>Kalle Kloakk was visiting the mall when he felt the urgent need to go to the toilet. When he locked the door, something went wrong! The lock to the bathroom door jammed! Kalle Kloakk was stuck in a public bathroom...<br/><br/>Kalle Kloakk looked around, and discovered a window. Kalle Kloakk tought: -\"<em>If I only could reach that window</em>\". Kalle Kloakk checked the room to see if there was any objects he could stack under the window, so it would be possible to clumb up and escape...</p>\n<p>And there they where: <strong>The toilet paper rolls</strong>....</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Control Kalle Kloakk around in the bathroom, and pick up as many toilet rolls as possible. To get the paper, you must first place plattform-bars to walk on. Choose the perfect height for each bar to create the level.</p>\n<p>When all bars are set, walk and jump around the screen to pick up the toilet paper. When all rolls of paper is taken, exit the screen by the flashing line.<br/><br/>If you beat all 8 levels, you will have enough toilet paper to build a stack under the window and climb out and leave the bathroom.<br/><br/>If you get stuck, pull joystick down and press fire to retry.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>KALLE KLOAKK 4K\u00a0- THE CREDITS:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Developed by Megastyle\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Published by Reset Magazine and Megastyle<br/>Programming by Docster\u00a0<br/>Graphic and Music by Rotteroy\u00a0</p>\n<p>Docs written by Rotteroy\r\n<br/>Digital Doc file programmed by Scroll<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to DMX, Sparkler, Scroll, Rage and Microbit\u00a0for helpful suggestions and testing the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/2494635f68d53ebb18b2dcafbda2579b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Megastyle"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
