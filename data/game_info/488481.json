He spoke of it and the treasure as often as he could find someone who would listen.</p>\n<p>At staff parties, he would spin tales and cursed priests, destroyed villages, and secret cities to anyone unfortunate enough to be\u00a0 cornered by him. This went on for years until he took a leave of absence and finally went to investigate the legend himself. He has not been seen in 9 years...</p>\n<p>This was a text adventure game written in anticipation of\u00a0 the 5th Rainbow Adventure Contest, which of course never happened.
