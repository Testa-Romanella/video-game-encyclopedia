Visitors wear masks to become faceless strangers. It's home to the unscrupulous, the outcast, and the desperate.</em></p>\n<p><em>You're one of the desperate.</em></p>\n<p><em>Strangers with their own secrets and ambitions can show you ways through the market. They'll guide you to your goal, but don't\u00a0trust them to have your best interests at heart.\u00a0</em></p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>The first chapter of a multi-chapter series.</li><li>Choose the protagonist's name, pronouns, and mask.</li><li>Two mysterious love interests (for now).</li><li>Over 30k words.</li><li>A dark, mature\u00a0story with many ways to fail.</li><li>Timed choices!\u00a0Or turn them off for an easier game.</li><li>Original music by Casja.</li><li>Use the default, OpenDyslexic, or Atkinson Hyperlegible font for ease of reading.</li></ul>\n\r\nCharacters\r\n\r\n\r\nKeir<br/>The Thief\r\n<p><em>\"When I compliment you \u2014 if that ever happens \u2014 you\u2019ll know.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>Where there is a market, there are thieves. Keir steals to feed hungry mouths, but never forget that to survive at the fringes requires the most ruthless kind of pragmatism.</p>\n\n\r\nCirrus <br/>The Priest\r\n<p><em>\"Penance is of the utmost importance here, and I think you'd best keep that soul of yours unblemished.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>The church of the Lunar God offers sanctuary to all who come to its doors and\u00a0Cirrus will give aid to those who request it. But there is no such thing as a gift in the market, and whatever aid Cirrus grants, he will want something in return.</p>\n\n\r\nFancy Stranger\r\n<p><em>\"I hope we'll meet again, if you don't mind me saying... you are a very kind person.\"</em></p>\n<p>Sweet and sun-kissed, someone such as him does not typically come to the market.
