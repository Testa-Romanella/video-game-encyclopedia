Zoom around your own tiny solar system! Race through the hanger of an orbiting space station! Don't crash.</p><p><strong>Controls:<br/>W/S/A/D or arrow keys: pitch and roll<br/>Q/E: yaw<br/>J/K: increase/decrease throttle<br/>H: hold down to activate Fantastic Drive<br/>P: pause / show controls</strong></p><p>(make sure you click inside the game for focus or else the controls won't work.)<br/></p><p>contact: nick.musurca at gmail.com (@musurca on twitter)<br/></p><p>Technical info: Laika uses real-time raymarching inside a GLSL shader. All objects and planetary bodies are rendered using signed distance fields and fractal noise functions.</p><p>I threw it together for the jam but will continue to add features if people dig it.</p><p>Thanks to iq, nimitz, P_Malin, and others in the Shadertoy community.</p><p>REQUIREMENTS: Latest Chrome or Firefox and a modern graphics card that supports fragment shaders. If you're having trouble getting it to work, please let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5c2d72d2362b97bd264aff19575f675.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gl.itch"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
