To do so you must collect the dugeon key in order to unlock the dungeon door to progress further. <br/></p>\n<p>Movement is controlled on a grid-base &amp; turn-based movement system, using the arrow keys. Everytime you move, you'll move a single grid space. However, moving will drain the character's energy and if the character's energy reaches \"0\" it's game over.\u00a0 To restore the character's enegry just simply walk over a potion tile.<br/></p>\n<p>Although, the further one ventures into the dungeon the more likely one will encounter an undead creature.\u00a0 An undead enemy will approach you if walk within their line of sight however, they will only move for every two grid spaces that the character moves.\u00a0To take out an enemy simply walk onto their tile before it is their turn to move. <br/></p>\n<p>*If an enemy spawns one tile away from you, then walk into a wall behind or below you. This will put an enemy in position for you to take them out. This was a bug I was sadly not able to fix.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Developer's Note:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Hi everyone, this project was another passion project of mine. I wanted to better my skills and understanding of C# and Unity. I still consider myself a novice as I struggled a little to finish this project. However, I certainly enjoyed developing it and I hope you enjoy playing it. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:58:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b6/5b682805c2087f2d011a457d9cc21ebb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["UntitledDev_"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
