Blow yourself up!</li><li>Time slows intentionally when setting up an explosion</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Not sure if it's my code (most likely), a Phaser 2.6.2 issue or a problem with the builder (or some combination), but I've been having trouble resetting the game state. Seems to be something with garbage collection. The current workaround is to just reset the whole game. This may have side effects like a psychedelic colour show.</li><li>Physics gets stressed when going too fast and collisions may not work perfectly at high speeds.</li><li>There might be some edge case I haven't figured out with the ramming angle. Seems like some kill shots end up killing the player instead.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/2146f24ae62fb7acb0d2842e4f03920b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kevin Xue"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
