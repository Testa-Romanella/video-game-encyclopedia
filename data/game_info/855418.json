I thought leaf platforming would be fun, and quickly realized that the game could take place in the same\u00a0universe that I'm creating for another game I'm working on.</p><p>I didn't entirely follow the optional mechanic \"one room only,\" because the game\u00a0takes place in no room at all.</p><p>I didn't follow the optional color palette \"autumn glow\".</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This is my upload for the Cozy Autumn Game Jam.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This makes my first game jam, first game release, and first time experimenting with music.\r\n</p>\n<p>I didn't realize the jam was here until I had about 9 days left, and a\u00a0lot of the content became a bit rushed near the end\u00a0due to lack of time.\r\n</p>\n<p>In any case, I greatly enjoyed participating in this game jam, and I learned a whole lot while doing it.
