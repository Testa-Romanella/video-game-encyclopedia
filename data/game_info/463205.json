The game is a non-linear management sandbox with 3D-rendered narrative scenes.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to leading your girls, you can develop your relationships with them. It's a rough world and you get to decide whether to grow their trust to become their lover, or build their submission to become their master. <strong>My Fallen Angels</strong> features a user-controlled sex scene system. In addition, there are over 20 HD rendered sex scenes, with many more planned!<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to support\u00a0 the development of <strong>My Fallen Angels</strong>,\u00a0please visit my Patreon Page.
