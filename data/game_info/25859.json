Standing in their way are six stages full of goofy \n      enemies! Play as Twinbee in one-player mode, or team up with Winbee in \n      two-player-cooperative mode. With powerful attacks like Big Shot, or \n      Twin Attack and Burst Attack in two-player mode, there's plenty of sting \n      in their arsenal! Use your Shot to transform Bells that appear in stages \n      into items with various effects. Stock up on these bad boys to expand \n      your attack range and really have a blast!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
