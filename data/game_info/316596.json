{"id": 316596, "slug": "lady-of-the-deep", "name": "Lady of the Deep", "name_original": "Lady of the Deep", "description": "<p>This project is set in an\r\nunderwater environment that features a sunken ship that has been lodged in the\r\nrocks at the bed of the ocean, a coral reef, seaweed, and the Lady of the\r\nDeep\u2019s underwater cave. The lighting of the game is set more dark in order to\r\nconvey the depth at which the Lady resides, with the Sun\u2019s rays only providing\r\nenough light to make traversing the murky waters doable. The colors reflect a\r\ncold and somber setting with ambient audio to further help exemplify this.</p>\n<p>The murkier location under the\r\nLady\u2019s cave has audio that reflects it, a more awe inspiring track can be heard\r\nwhen approaching/adventuring around the sunken ship, and a more upbeat and\r\nwondrous sound around the brightly colored coral reef. The audio overall\r\naccurately represents the starker and isolated environment of the sea. </p>\n<p>The Lady herself is covered in\r\nspiraling tattoos that represent the flow of the water that makes up the\r\nenvironment she lives in. Her movement is understood by the water that can be\r\nseen carrying her throughout her world. As she powers up (by pressing \u201cr\u201d) her\r\ntattoos glow and her body becomes luminescent purple from her inner energy,\r\nsignifying the more royal status the Lady has among her fellow sea creatures,\r\ngiven her inherent abilities to control the eb and flow of water molecules. As\r\nher energy increases, the water surrounds her, allowing her to gain even more\r\nenergy, which is translated in the bright cyan glow of her hair and tattoos\r\nwhich become so bright their glow can be seen through the water surrounding her\r\nbody. </p>\n<p>Her idles show the pulsing of her\r\ntattoos and the inner power they represent as well as the Lady playing with an\r\norb of water representing her boredom due to her isolation from other\r\nintelligent life, at the bottom of the ocean.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The Lady does well to avoid the uncanny\r\nvalley, despite having gills, because her human body is accurately proportional\r\nand the art style strays from hyper realism but isn\u2019t dumbed down to farfetched\r\nsimplicity.</p>\n<p>This project took A LOT of time and\r\neffort and is something I am very proud of. I hope you enjoy experiencing my\r\ncreation!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T05:12:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75f/75f485964646d070bfc5d445739cfbff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["michaeldiperi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
