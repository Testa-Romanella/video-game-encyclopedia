This is my first game developed with Unity and in C#. while I'm not new to game development entirely, my only development platform was Flash with Actionscript 2, so you can imagine the jump I made :D</p><p>This game is marked as in development as I plan on tightening controls and adding features, perhaps even releasing it in the form of a \"Space Mines 2\"! The game itself is free but with the option of paying what you want. While you don't have to pay, every bit helps me to make newer and better games!</p><p><strong>Installation</strong></p><p>This is a standalone file, so you should be able to place the game with its folder in any directory and play it just fine. As a quick note the game doesn't play very well on the lowest Resolution setting and the keys are bound to the arrow keys and Z, so you can't change any of that. I'll be changing how the game handles input later, just as soon as I figure out how.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af6/af6553aa047bd4c5e27bc5a7268403c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Junksprite"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
