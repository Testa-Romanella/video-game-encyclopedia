I didnt do the fourth video tutorial at all.</p>\n<p>2. I recorded my own sound effects (which are pretty entertaining if I do say so myself)</p>\n<p>3. The AI is slightly different in small ways: it chases the ball different, and is a little bit more human.</p>\n<p>4. there is a fun launch animation every time the ball drops into play. \u00a0it launches when it reaches the center of the board and goes randomly in one of 4 directions.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Player:\u00a0arrow keys up and down to control the paddle on the right.\u00a0\u00a0Thats it.</p>\n<p>(secret: if you download the python source you can swap out a single line and switch from AI to 2players and if you do then WASD controls the left paddle.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T04:41:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b2/3b20a8ed760d0fc6796ebfc474892581.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Fab Dynamic"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
