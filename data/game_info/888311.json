Why deliver when somebody is at home, when we can make their lives that much harder and deliver their packages when nobody is at home to collect them? Well, thats <strong>exactly\u00a0</strong>what we do here!</p>\n<p>You're a driver, so your tasks are to pick up the packages at the warehouse and deliver them to their destinations. For every package delivered when nobody is at home, you'll get a handsome bonus\u00a0(on top of the normal delivery fee), and some extra time for your run!</p>\n<p>Your shift ends when the timer runs out, and your score the day will be the amount of money you earned. Be careful though - watch the warehouse package count. If it ever hits its limit, your shift ends IMMEDIATELY.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, what are you waiting for? The truck has gas - lets get going!</p><p><em>Known issue on MacOS (and maybe other platforms): sometimes the game crashes.
