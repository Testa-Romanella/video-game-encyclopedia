It will be your duty to defend the different areas of this colony. This game mixes several aspects :<br/><br/>- At first you have the management phase, which is turn based. You are going to have to see that area needs allied reinforcements to prevent it from being captured by the enemy. The game is based on a principle of turns and events. <br/>The player will perform a number of events before tackling the final boss. For this he will have a limited turn number. If he exhausts all his turns without having finished all his events, the player loses the game.<br/><br/>- In the second phase, you fight against other ships. They too are turn-based. During your fights the player will have to choose his actions. His ship generates a number of energy per turn, it's up to you to see what actions you can undertake. <br/><br/>It is very important to know that the game is oriented \"rogue-like\" and therefore you will often die and start again to get there.Important Features<br/><ul><li>The game is turn based<br/></li><li>You can choose and customize your spaceship<br/></li><li>Random event system for more replayability<br/></li><li>You keep your money and ore between each run, to make the next more easy ...<br/></li><li>You can unlock new spaceships by achieving success</li></ul>The characteristics expected<br/><ul><li>New playable maps with more diversity<br/></li><li>A conquering mode with a large map.
