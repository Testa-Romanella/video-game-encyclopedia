It was released only in Japan. However, as the GBA has no region lockout, any GBA unit can be used to play the Japanese version. The menus in the Japanese version are simple enough so that they are easily navigable by a player with little or no Japanese language skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-27T09:57:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/aeb/aeb24f4d940c25e194bf9b8eee45a2b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Eighting", "8ing"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
