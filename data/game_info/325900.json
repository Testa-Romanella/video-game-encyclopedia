(Requires SteamVR)<br/></p>\n<p>Your goal is to reach the end to establish a connection! Block and dodge obstacles to prevent your packet from becoming malformed, and choose the optimal path at each router so you don't timeout!</p>\n<p>Created for Extra Credits Game Jam #4. This is my first time creating a game in 3D, so it was a lot of fun messing around with both VR and 3D components! I tested using a Windows Mixed Reality headset, so I'm not sure how compatible it is with other headsets. The game uses SteamVR, so it should be compatible with the Vive and Oculus as well!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Source Code:<br/>https://github.com/NickAzn/EC-Game-Jam-4<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T18:48:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/445/445515b0caa61da98fca3e2b65dc07e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CorgiRam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
