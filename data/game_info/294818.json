You should be able to complete the full game in just under an hour unless you get stuck.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The basic gameplay of UpEnd is very straightforward:\u00a0Drag black dominoes around the board. When you press the Spacebar, the white domino on the board will knock over hopefully knocking over your black dominoes so that they knock over all of the green dominoes on the map.</p>\n<p>To prevent \"cheating\", any black dominoes that knock a green domino must have been knocked by a white domino or a black domino that was indirectly touched by a white domino. In other words, there must be a chain of events leading back to a white domino otherwise knocking over the green domino won't count (e.g. you can't just position a black domino right next to a green domino in the air and press play)</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Toggle Play\u00a0Mode\u00a0(knock over white domino)</strong>: Spacebar</p>\n<p><strong>Drag Domino</strong>:\u00a0Left click on domino<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Change Domino Orientation</strong>: Tab while dragging domino</p>\n<p><strong>Rotate Domino</strong>:\u00a0R key while dragging domino</p>\n<p><strong>Rotate Camera:</strong>\u00a0Hold middle mouse button and move mouse</p>\n<p><strong>Zoom Camera</strong>:\u00a0Mouse wheel</p>\n<p>If a black\u00a0domino is showing red dots it means that you can't place it where you want to</p>\n<p>Dominoes will automatically try to go to the highest spot available where you are trying to drag, so they will position themselves on top of obstacles and other dominoes automatically. If this doesn't happen, try dragging away and dragging back to where you want to go - this usually fixes it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T04:07:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/366/366be1ae404456f28987f60dec760d8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["morphinegames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
