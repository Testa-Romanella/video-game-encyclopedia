Theme separation: you have to separate your flaming form from armour to melt enemies, but you need armour to build a house and win.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT! TO GET OUT OF ARMOUR BY PRESSING \"F\" YOU HAVE TO HOLD NOTHING IN YOUR HANDS!</strong></p>\n\n<p>You are Fauer, a flame familiar of a witch. She sends you for a quest to build her a cosy cabin in the woods. She gives you armour made from an old oven, so you don't burn the trees. But ice monsters are coming down from the mountains to stop you. You have to get out of your armour to melt them and ice which built up on the trees. Be careful tho, because your armour can be destroyed even without you inside it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cut the trees with your axe and bring the wood to the building site to build a wooden cabin. You can grab items by pressing E and drop them by pressing Q. You can Water pinecones while holding a bucket and swing your axe by pressing SPACE. To get out of your armour press F, and press E while next to it to get inside again. Fauer can set ground on fire by pressing SPACE. Your armour can extinguish the flames. Good luck and have fun!</p>\n<p>Title art by my brother &lt;3</p><p>Liluo.io Game Link\u00a0https://liluo.io/crypto_tost/oven-knight<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T19:49:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2cebd3584350cea05c1ba5da840e5288.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Crypto Tost"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
