Dancers of indiscriminate race and gender move to the\r\nmusic in front of a lone figure journeying through ever-changing\r\nscenes. The dancers were created with Make Human software, an\r\napplication that customizes a base humanoid figure based on dozens of\r\nfinely adjustable parameters, including gender, race and body type.\r\nCreating persons free from the constraints of binary concepts was\r\nliberating. I mapped animations to the dancers in Blender and\r\noutputted the animated models to Unity. The application was\r\noriginally projected as visuals to accompany a show at Oil Club in\r\nShenzhen, China and has been shown at various music events in\r\nSavannah, Georgia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br/>You do not have control over the figure's movements in this version as it was meant to run endlessly as visuals accompanying a music set. It would be fun to play with movement and exploration in later versions. <br/></p>\n<p>The original version takes input from your computers microphone. The sound from the microphone will alter the yellow bars in front of the camera.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong></p>\n<p>Email me at marco.flagg@gmail.com.
