You as the player use directional controls to rotate the ship and apply thrust in the direction of rotation; In order to land precisely and accumulate as many points as possible. My recreation of said game in 3-dimensional space was a result of preference and my inexperience with 2D game development.</p>\n<p>Sourced Audio:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Effects: BootstrapMade, 2006.
