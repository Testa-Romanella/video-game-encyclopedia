{"id": 368620, "slug": "outbound-gbjam4-game", "name": "Outbound (GBjam4 Game)", "name_original": "Outbound (GBjam4 Game)", "description": "<p>Outbound is a game I made for GBjam4 in 2015. It was overall rank #40 of 169 games.\u00a0</p>\r\nThis version has been slightly modified to have a better title screen, and proper looping on the game music. There is however a bug where the game will probably crash after you win, and it's probably from compiling the game with a much newer version of GMS than the one I created it on. This upload is just a legacy piece, so I don't have any intention to work on fixing that bug however! If you want to play the game in its original glory, check out\u00a0Outbound on GameJolt.\r\n<p>Music was done by the super talented commandycan!</p>\n<p>From the original upload:<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>A = Jump/Start<br/>S = Attack<br/>Up/Down/Left/Right = Navigate</p>\n<p>From the long lost manual found in a time capsule left in the late 80s:</p>\n<p><em>In AD 2101, war<br/>was happening.<br/><br/>Shot down by a<br/>SPACE SHIP, our<br/>HERO is stranded<br/>on the mysterious<br/>ALIEN HOMEWORLD.<br/><br/>Protected only by<br/>TWO GENERATORS,<br/>our HERO's BEACON<br/>is calling for<br/>rescue.<br/><br/>The ALIENs are<br/>driven mad by the<br/>sound of the<br/>BEACON!<br/><br/>Protect the<br/>GENERATORS and<br/>the BEACON!<br/><br/>Survive long<br/>enough to be<br/>OUTBOUND.</em></p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>When you die you have access to the loadout shop! For 100 shmeckles, you can get the Double Jump ability, which gives you access to the Rechargers. Shooting a Recharger will refill that side's Generator life by up to 50 HP per wave. The Double Jump is the only purchasable item that doesn't go away after you die!</p>\n<p>When the first wave is starting, venture into a Hive room on either side, and destroy the first wave of eggs. You'll get a lot of shmeckles to spend in the shop without the risk of the other side becoming overwhelmed by unchecked enemies!</p>\n<p>Crabbens sometimes drop direct upgrades for your weapons or shield, so jungle them whenever possible!</p>\n<p>If 5 waves prove to be too easy because of your wicked skills, try increasing the number of waves from the title screen with left/right! There are a few more types of enemies that appear during higher waves!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06d5c813a425dd39a73bdbcb45b9eaba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Programancer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
