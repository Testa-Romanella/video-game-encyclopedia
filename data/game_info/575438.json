{"id": 575438, "slug": "suplex-and-the-city", "name": "Suplex and the City", "name_original": "Suplex and the City", "description": "<ul><li>This is a very early build of a high concept prototype.\u00a0 A beat 'em up with just the German suplex? Sounds silly, but then I designed it on paper, and started coding the next day. I was surprised with its unique feeling, depth, and player agency, even at an early stage.\u00a0 I have so many places I'd like to take this, so please rate, comment, review, and donate if you want to see more!</li><li>Please use a controller!<ul><li>If not, Arrow keys move you. X and Z are Suplex and Push. R and T are Reset and Taunt. Escape quits.</li></ul></li><li>Suplex button: Shoots and grabs the opponent. When you hold and when you release effects how you hold and release your suplex</li><li>Push button: If you're holding an opponent, pushes them. If not, and you have meter, pulls them toward you</li><li>Super: With full meter, Suplex + Push. A variety of crazy things happen as your meter drains, you are basically OP in this mode</li><li>Pinning: Pinning opponent nets you much more power ups</li><li>Release suplexes: But release suplexes deal more damage</li><li>Taunt: You can taunt, which will slowly regain stamina. Press and hold Select or T after a suplex to taunt</li><li>Kip Up: You can kip up after a suplex, giving you extra iframes. Press suplex as you are getting up to Kip Up (You can mash in current build)</li><li>Up and Down: Hold up and down to get Avalanche and Snap variant suplexes.\u00a0The Avalanche deals the most damage. The Snap can lead to a fast count pin.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T05:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/105/10544dd2bfaca01da7efb901d9ba07f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["snarge"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
