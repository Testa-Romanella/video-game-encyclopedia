Mines can appear on layers above and below the one you're looking at; use the arrows on the left and the number to navigate between them. So when you see the number of mines around a cell, this also includes the 3x3 grid on the layers below and above. Other than that, it works as you'd expect: right click to open a cell, left click to flag it. You win when all cells that do not contain mines are opened. You can also right click an opened cell, and if the number of flags around it matches it will open all unopened cells around it. Be careful, this will also open cells on adjacent layers, and can cause you to blow up if the flags are wrong!</p>\n<p>A simple game written in Python to practice programming. The size of the grid (in all directions) and the number of mines can be set.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T11:54:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aaba47d653bc0b52bd9cba45f154392.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedDragonMakesGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
