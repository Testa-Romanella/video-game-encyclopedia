Maquette makes it possible by twisting the world into itself recursively in an MC Escher-esque fashion.</p>\n<p>Head to the center of the world and you&#39;ll feel like a giant, towering over buildings and walls. But venture further out, and start to feel small as things get larger and larger - to the point where cracks in the ground become chasms.</p>\n<p>In Maquette you will explore the scales of everyday problems in a modern-day love story. Where sometimes the smallest of issues can become insurmountable obstacles.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T10:08:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/954/95415143e264cdf3d506f55f52ef9b7c.jpg", "website": "https://www.insidedecay.com/maquette", "rating": 3.2, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 52, "owned": 356, "beaten": 78, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 47, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 93, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 96, "platforms": ["PlayStation 5", "PC", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Graceful Decay"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Annapurna Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
