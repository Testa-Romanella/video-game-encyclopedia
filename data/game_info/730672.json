In this 2D platformer, Firecracker faces many dangers, the biggest one: his own weapon, and surging memories. Will you take that journey? A two-sided blade, where there's risk, and reward, where you explore the balance of nature, society, and gods, the good, and the bad. Where the opposites work together, making the world spin, and yet where Firecracker steps in believing he could halt that. Albeit the question stands; How can the cycle of life be brought to a standstill? Can it? <br/><br/></p>\r\nGameplay Instructions \r\n<ul><li>E- view items (then click out of the item with the mouse)</li><li>D - Move right</li><li>A- Move left</li><li>SPACE- jump</li><li>W- Jump higher</li><li>Z- Dash (jump in air direction and dash)</li><li>X- Teleport (hold x and then click in the circle where you'd like to teleport</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Originally created for Global Game Jam 2022, as a collaboration between Galway and Seattle.</p>\r\nGalway team\r\n<ul><li>Skritz1526 : Initial concept, Narrative Design, writing </li><li>anthonyGameJam16: Programming, Level Design</li><li>olaaki: 2D Art, Character Design, Narrative Prop Design</li><li>matty_: 2D Art, Animation</li></ul>\r\nSeattle team\r\n<ul><li>fluffy:\u00a0Composer, Sound\u00a0Design</li><li>CoreyKemper: 2D Art, Environmental Design</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T08:42:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/488/4885ce7a6c4e45bc8994bc0c0fe91850.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Firecrackers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
