We were tasked with recreating the classic game \"Pacman\" using our own visual style! As a final part of the assignment, we needed to add some new features of some kind, and that's exactly what I did!</p>\r\nWhat new features did you add exactly?\r\n<p>After playing a lot of Splitgate recently, I decided to give Pacman the ability to teleport! In my new version, the ghosts move faster than you, so if you want to escape them, you are going to have to learn to use the wonderful power of teleportation!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Within a day of when it had to be submitted, I also thought to myself: \"I wonder if I can make the world tile infinitely?\", and spoiler alert: apparently I could indeed make the world tile infinitely! I tweaked a few other things here and there to make gameplay feel better, and voil\u00e0! Here is my amazing version of Pacman!</p>\r\nHow in the heck do I move?\r\n<p>Use the\u00a0<strong>WASD keys</strong>\u00a0to move your creepy lil' eyeball fellow about the place, and if you are playing in the second level, press the <strong>Space key</strong> to set a teleport point, and Space again to switch back to where you were!<br/></p>\r\nHow do I play this intriguing creation?\r\n<p>Press the <strong>Download\u00a0</strong>button below, and once it has downloaded, unzip the file and open\u00a0<strong>Pacman.exe.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:02:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19d/19d472d269c46333066302e8be80d55e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RadiantInferno"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
