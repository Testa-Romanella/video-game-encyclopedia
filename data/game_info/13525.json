The first game in the series called Assassin\u2019s Creed was praised for its mechanics and interesting setting yet it was highly criticized for being too repetitive and boring. It took 2 long years for Ubisoft to repair their mistakes and that resulted in Assassin\u2019s Creed II. Now, the game looks a lot better not only graphical bus also gameplay-wise. It became much more interesting and epic. <br />\nAssassin\u2019s Creed II offers a fictional history setting which as in all the others games in franchise tells a story about the never-ending war between assassins and the Knights Templars who want to control the world. The story of the game is set in modern times and it fallows Desmond Miles who once again has to go into the machine called Animus to relive his genetic memories of his ancestor who now is Ezio Auditore da Firenze.  The main story takes place in Italy during the Renaissance period in the 15th and early 16th century. Cities of Florence, Venice, Tuscany and Forli are fully explorable. Ezio fights those who betrayed his family and the player is kindly welcomed to experience this epic story as the Ezio himself.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2010-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T11:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c14/c14d85f2ec10e82e3d5cd837c9c0a56d.jpg", "website": "http://www.assassinscreed.com", "rating": 4.33, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 94, "owned": 2282, "beaten": 612, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 65, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 13, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 517, "suggestions_count": 534, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 520, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Montreal"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
