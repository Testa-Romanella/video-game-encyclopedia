I was to make a game that I was inspired by at the Gallery of Modern Art. The piece that struck out for me was the large room with a table full of lego. The artist wanted to challenge the notion that art can only be made by one person.<br/></p><p>What I did to recreate that is the game saves the location of every block on quit and loads them all on start. It's doing that by loading/saving a .csv file. (blog coming soon).
