We applied the theme in a few ways, nature vs technology, elementals opposing each other\u2026and a song reference if you look hard enough. ;) This game was completed in just one week, so please keep in mind there may be a few issues (due to too much caffeine, too little sleep and having to wrangle a 8 month old puppy). Hope you enjoy it and let us know what you think! <strong>\u00a0\u2661\u00a0</strong>We\u2019d love to revisit the game later and change/add things and suggestions are always welcome.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T13:11:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac159e2e27808312b472ee0fa686e96a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 301, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ShyVisual", "Acrlixe"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
