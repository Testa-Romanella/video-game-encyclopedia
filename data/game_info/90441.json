After extensive\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\ttesting we found a calibration that worked for all browsers, except Chrome.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t(If you are hitting bang on beat it will still be within the 'perfect' margin on\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChrome, it will just be less forgiving to late timings and more forgiving to hitting\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t early)\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t \tIF YOU INSIST ON USING CHROME:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Chrome problem is not specific to this game, but affects\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tall games. It's just this game requires a degree of accuracy so high that the\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\ttiny lag caused by Chrome's inbuilt Flash Player is enough to  \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tthrow the timing off. YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK IN CHROME by going to chrome://plugins and disabling all plugins with \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t'PepperFlash' in the location. This will make it use the normal Flash player like the other browsers, if you have it \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tinstalled.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\t(apparently Chrome is shutting down Flash at the end of the year anyways, that's why we've remade the full game in Unity now, but for browser demos Unity is terrible, oh golly what will we do)\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tIF YOU ARE USING LINUX:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you get significant delays in hearing sounds, check \r\n\tthis thread for a solution. Thanks to @EspyoPT for the tip!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIF YOU STILL THINK THE TIMING IS OFF: You are\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tprobably used to hitting earlier in all rhythm games. In this game, you must\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tget over the automatic compensation that you usually do. One easy way\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tto do this is to hit the spacebar with force, as if you are hitting a drum,\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tand making sure that sound coincides exactly with the clap\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tfrom the game. Try hitting\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\ta surface near your spacebar for the first six beats,\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tlistening to the sound of your hits,\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tand then SLAMMING your hand onto your spacebar on the seventh! This\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tadvice seemed to work with almost everybody when\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\twe had a booth at GDC. Sorry about\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tyour spacebar:3\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd if after all that you still think it is off, tweet me!
