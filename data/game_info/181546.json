I am still on the learning boat of creating games, much less distributing them. My passion is to give myself the problems for me to fix such as figuring out certain elements and mechanics in order to not only improve my coding abilities, by improve myself as as person. The concept of this game so far is to read its simple story consisting of only a few sentences, as well as defeat the evil boss which is coded to be one of the most simple yet challenging bosses ever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de5/de57b578b9cc13e584aa451dac8e606c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sireoh"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
