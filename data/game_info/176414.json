But it's not just a simple shield, you can repel enemy attacks and perform pushes. <br/></p>\n<p>The idea is to use defense as the main weapon. When defending from an attack, the attack is repelled and special bar increases. The special attack is a powerful push that throws enemies away and together can come rewards as an extra life. <br/></p>\n<p>I made all the code in Unity3D. All models were created by the second team member, Alvaro Augusto. The sound effects are from the royalty free \u00a0\u00a0Audio Game GDC bundle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6ad6ba6ddaee2ccb77a535014548a892.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["romulosantos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
