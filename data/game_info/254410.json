You find the nearest sewer entrance and run in after it.<br />\nAlong the way you will meet others that are also stricken by abnormal or psychological fear. You may be able to help them, just as you may be able to free yourself, but just as likely, they and you may be beyond help.<br />\nThis game has controller support but you must first click past the graphic options. Do not rebind any of the keys if you plan on using the controller. The menus are hard programmed to the controller input&#39;s not the button labels, and currently there is no support to open the steam overlay with a controller.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-06T04:40:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cdb/cdb223d23d3e25120da5b6e10dabccb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.26, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 21, "owned": 112, "beaten": 40, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 5, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 41, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 42, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Akuma Kira"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["KIRA"], "esrb_rating": null}
