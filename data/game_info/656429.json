This was made in 1 week for the brackeys game jam. I made all the assets myself, except the font\u00a0(and the game engine\u00a0if you count that as an asset).</p>\n<p>I forgot to mention in the instructions, but you can use Q and E to zoom in and out. Sorry, I don't have enough time to add it into the \"How to play\" menu,\u00a0and re-build the game. HTML builds take a long time to build, and they take even longer on a low-tier laptop like mine.</p>\n<p>Also, I planned to have sound effects and post processing, but I ran out of time.</p>\n<p>I might make an improved version after the jam and voting period end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T22:37:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f11/f1174d597537e28dbf5aa2b85cab412a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jellogramming"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
