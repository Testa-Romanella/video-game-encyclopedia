You control two of yourself and navigate through complexities and get yourself out of the ground below. <br/> <br/>It currently has 4 levels that shows you the first two obstacles you will encounter more in the future. <br/> <br/>Pardon the feature of clunky controls. I've designed it that way. <br/> <br/>Supposed to have nicer graphics at this point but I've kept it simple to concentrate on other aspects. <br/> <br/>Simple enough. Or is it? <br/> <br/>QUESTIONS: <br/>If you have any questions, hit me up @furriKira on Twitter <br/>or PM me on my YouTube channel: http://youtube.com/furrikira <br/>or Note me on deviantART: http://furrikira.deviantart.com <br/> <br/>P.S.: I've also included the mini-soundtrack if you are interested. (2 songs) The soundtrack might include more songs in the future. <br/> <br/>NOTE: This is also my first time joining in the Ludum Dare and I thought this would be a good practice if I could handle game development on my own, be-it me being a Multimedia Artist in the first place.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9d/d9d8c25789dadefb42eeed2b8a50b898.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaiera"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
