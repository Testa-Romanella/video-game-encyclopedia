Here you can become one of the legendary heroes fighting against monsters, dragons, and other adventurers for the treasures of the Golden Lands. <br/><br/>There are no lines or creeps and nexus here. Wealth is your only goal. You are to slay monsters and seize their chests with gold, become invisible, steal treasures from other teams, defend your own gold and triumph in the dynamic fantasy PvP. Four teams make the situation on the map unpredictable: victory, seemingly so close, may slip away in one second. Golden Rush is no place to relax \u2013 it's a treasure hunt you have to carry through!<br/><br/>Here's what else you will experience in the game:<br/><br/><ul><li>Level up your hero after choosing one of six basic classes, be it a seductive witch or a furious barbarian.<br/></li><li>Look for a unique tactics of victory in the new MOBA that is different from all the other ones.<br/></li><li>Slay hundreds of monsters, defeat bosses and turn into a Bone Dragon that tosses enemy heroes around as if they were puppets.<br/></li><li>Collect artifacts looted from monsters and assemble unique armour sets.<br/></li><li>Take part in rating battles and monthly tournaments.<br/></li><li>Organize well-coordinated teams of friends and fight against experienced opponents.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-07T06:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e0483bf8b4a91142353e7a4e5e7e2d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 240, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 61, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 491, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Forbes Consult"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["ELYLAND  INVESTMENT COMPANY"], "esrb_rating": null}
