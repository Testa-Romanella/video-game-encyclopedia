As you walk down the sidewalk towards your humble home, which you have nailed at least one of your pieces of bread onto for the same reason you wear your chef's clothing everywhere you go, you suddenly trip and in a purple flash,\u00a0you are transported through unknown means to a different world. You find yourself in a pit, with a crudely thrown together bread stand, a humanoid made of bread who's head looks to be a piece of bread infested with weird cursed worms, its eyeballs, held on by strange tiny purple worms or tendrils, they are lifeless and dull, yet look into your soul. The creature's\u00a0neck is replaced by a few larger tendrils, holding it above its large vaguely-bread-shaped mass of a torso. Your gut feeling tells you this creature yearns for\u00a0<em><strong>b r e a d</strong></em>. There's also some weird business dude floating behind the bread man, his legs look severed with a purple glow at the point of severing, he has a smug face, his hands point towards a strange purple crystal. You ask the man what it is, he replies that it is what you need to get home and prices it at 30 euros. He mentions the bread man has unlimited money to spare. Burt knows his purpose, Burt knows what he must do, his life has been leading up to this moment:</p>\n<p><strong><em>he must make bread</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T18:06:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd2f0aac2b26edfaedfbf86ddcf1b19e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thor30056"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
