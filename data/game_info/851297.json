Set in a strangely structured house with a somber history, players control Dwayne Anderson as he explores the backstories of the inhabitants that once lived there. The game is presented in first-person perspective, and a large portion of the house is accessible, although some areas require keys. Obstacles include avoiding the dark to reduce loss of sanity, though several tools can aid players through the dark.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T12:44:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/115/115665f5266e711a89491b5c6ba8da30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WicherD"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
