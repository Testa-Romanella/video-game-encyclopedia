This island has creatures from unknown history and these new-discovered species are called \u201cThe Lerugs\u201d. These creatures follow the command of their master named \u201cLur\u2019feoraun\u201d and they are the only beings who walk around this island. They have no relation and friendship with any other being as they are the only living beings of this island. However, this island has a place for possible life, it has the sources needed to survive, such as fresh water, and oxygen, but the food in there is made of different plants and trees, and the food can be rather too harsh to taste at first.
