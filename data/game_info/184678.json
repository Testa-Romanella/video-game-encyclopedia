I'd like to re-start the development as there is a lot of potential for the project.</p>\n<p>As of the time of this writing, the project is barely playable. You can capture a pirate base and fend of an infinite hoard of pirates. You can also build a handful of buildings. The project\u00a0 is also missing configuration options and has a monitoring window that is used for development.</p>\n<p>Please leave feedback. The more feedback I get, the more I will work on this project!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c18/c18c3f84084e5e31b04735a3a131ac61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ppatenaude"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
