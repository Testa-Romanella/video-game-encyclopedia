It was all to get some practice on creating and integrating sound for games. So\u00a0sound up. I actually prefer it without the music, so you can hear all the effects, but wanted to try and integrate music/timing into it. All of the effects were recorded specifically for this in my studio using metal plates, ping pong balls, offcuts of wood with a combinatin of contact and condenser microphones, or synthesised with Max/MSP, Ableton. Integrated with Wwise.</p>\n<p>Controls should be self-explanatory. Made for mouse but you can use the arrow keys too.\u00a0Mouse scroll wheel changes sensitivity. Oh also, I added left shift as an alternative to firing beacuse on Macs control+left arrow does something weird, but I forgot to add it to the controls list.</p>\n<p>I spent WAY too long on this. Feedback welcome; praise more so.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T03:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b78b195542ad7ce82334a994161a4eb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["blubberbaleen"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
