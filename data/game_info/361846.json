Make 'em count.</p>\n<p>The longer you wait, the more likely you'll hit.\u00a0 You want to shoot first, but you also want to wait as long as possible.</p>\n<p>Recommended way to play: Have the 2 players stand or sit next to the computer, with hands behind their backs, as the game starts. This way reaching for the button is a big movement, giving the other player some time to act.</p>\n<p>There is also a single player option, but that lacks the bluffing, and feinting, and mind-games that make this fun, so I recommend you grab a friend for this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6c/e6c941b27048a32710bab6bf90921b6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zeedar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
