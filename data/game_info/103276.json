People come in, serve them coffee, get tips, how hard can it be?</p><p>Mud Slinger is a lightweight, single player game about daily work as a barista at a cafe, the endless parade of weird people asking stupid, stupid questions, tipping poorly, and of course, wild rabid badgers coming through the door. You know, daily life stuff.</p><p><strong>REAL STORY:</strong> The Bitter End is a small 24 hour coffee house on the west end of Grand Rapids, Michigan. It's Jack Kerouac, it's James Dean, it's GG Allin and it's unlike any other place I have ever been. The building is over 100 years old, a former bank, and is filled with character, charm, and strangeness. No, they did not pay me to make this. I just like it that much.</p><p>If ever you find yourself in Grand Rapids, be sure to make it to The Bitter End and order a BullShot. Yes, they do exist and yes, they are horrible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcf8d853af3cf926a56818eaea8c606f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amon Twentysix"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
