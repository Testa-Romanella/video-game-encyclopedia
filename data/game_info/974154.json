Spanning approximately 20 minutes, this story-driven platformer is not just a game, but a fragment of my life, transformed into an interactive narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn 'Crying Alone', you'll walk through the echoes of a relationship that profoundly changed me. Experience the raw emotions of waking up to a world turned upside down, the struggle to find footing amidst the chaos of loss, and the gradual path towards acceptance and self-discovery. Each level, each scene, each moment in this game is a reflection of my journey - from the depths of despair to the first glimmers of hope.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the developer and narrator of this story, I invite you to immerse yourself in a tale that's not often told, but deeply felt by many.
