To your amazement, the doodle comes to life before your very eyes! You watch as the pencil, possessed, begins to draw doodle after doodle, all of them coming to life. You look up. The teacher is coming! You grab your trusty eraser; it\u2019s time to go to work.<br/>In Pencil vs. Eraser, you face an onslaught of evil pencil doodles that have come to life. Choose from a variety of weapons from powerful missiles to the versatile flower gun and go to battle. Try to erase the doodles while they\u2019re being drawn or you risk being overrun by a variety of enemies from aliens to pizza; there\u2019s even a giant poop that spawns flies! When you fail, use the cash you\u2019ve earned to upgrade your eraser and try again. How many of the procedurally generated levels can you finish?<br/><br/><br/><br/>When I, Quinn Purdy, made Pencil vs. Eraser I wanted to recreate the joy I experienced as a kid playing imagination games. I remember spending countless hours doodling imaginary characters, having fights with my action figures and creating scenarios for them, and running around in the backyard with my friends using toy swords to fight villains that nobody else could see. Perhaps it was a bit odd, but it was a blast! I hope you enjoy playing as much as I enjoyed creating this love letter to my childhood, and perhaps playing will inspire you to reminisce on your childhood.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>\u2022\t99999 procedurally generated levels.
