{"id": 264032, "slug": "constantinople-board-game", "name": "Constantinople Board Game", "name_original": "Constantinople Board Game", "description": "Constantinople is a solitaire historical wargame covering the millennium-long history of the Byzantine empire, from the foundation of Constantinople in AD330 until its fall in AD1453. You will use military might as well as diplomacy and outright bribery to keep the many opposing forces at bay for as long as possible. Can you outlive the historic Byzantine empire, or will your efforts be relegated to an obscure footnote in the history books?<br/><br/>Constantinople is not a highly detailed, historically accurate simulation of the history of the Byzantine Empire, but is historically based and gives a sense of the real situation of the Byzantine Empire throughout its existence, and provides some insights into the history surrounding Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire. <br/><br/>App is optimized for iPhone but playable on iPad (just bigger).<br/><br/>Short gameplay video: https://youtu.be/lBMwh4gbDPw<br/><br/>Original board game design: Steve Ashing (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/89972/steve-ashing)<br/>Board game art: Ilya Kudriashov (https://www.flickr.com/photos/ilya_kudriashov/)<br/>Music: \"The Descent\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/>Other sounds: \"Medieval Fanfare\" tobyk (https://www.freesound.org/people/tobyk/sounds/26198/)<br/><br/>App is created with permission from original game designer and graphic artist.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T08:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4b/f4bb3f6a4db4bf6bea9a0f01c1201ecb.jpg", "website": "http://boardnaut.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Marian Gablovsky"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Marian Gablovsky"], "esrb_rating": null}
