Should you see anything else in need of mentioning, do let me know!</p>\n\n<p>This was practice to attempt to learn how to use Ren'py more fluently, I hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>If it's enjoyed enough could potentially be expanded on with more scenes? That's to be seen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T15:07:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a61/a610c2262bf8dd565f7635f963147dbc.jpg", "website": "https://www.daybeforegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["B(ee)"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
