As you explore around the biggest city of Teros, you can develop the team by having heroes strike against the biggest monsters of the land, earn yourself some fames and money from doing good deeds to the land, or just fill up your wallet from some casual works. The more you build up, the more heroes will lend their strength to you, increasing the strength of your team to help your heroes for the upcoming epic battles. <br/>Players have the chance to fight against the most dreadful, fiercest, and gigantic bosses from the moment they enter the game, surrounded by  a destructible 3D environment.
