The theme was sacrifice, which we tried to represent with the spider sacrificing himself to make more babies at the end of each level, and our limitation was \"tiny character\" which we covered by basing the game around a little spider. The main inspiration for this game was an old flashgame called Hanger on NotDoppler. It was made in 42 hours by Chris Stehlar (Programming) and Yazz Miller (Art).</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>LMB (Left click) hold to shoot a web</p>\n<p>ESC to exit to the menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T04:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec3/ec32101b60318a2c4aa4c0d91385f529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["khrindour"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
