Pay him back by destroying other ships and stealing their money. You have 3 minutes to pay off your current payment, if you haven\u2019t collected enough money by then, you need to SACRIFICE your ship components to get the money you need. Those can also be lost in combat and also gained when left intact after you destroy an enemy. If you lose a component you can buy a bad emergency component to keep going. I had no time for Audio sorry about that.</strong></p>\n<p>Bug Reports are appreciated I had literally no time to test the finished version.</p>\n\n<p>The game is lacking a lot of content, especially because there aren\u2019t enough different components, but I had a lot of fun so I might continue the project.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>W to accelerate</li><li>A/D to turn</li><li>SPACE to shoot</li><li>R to turn brakes on/off (If brakes are off you keep flying forever)</li><li>ESC to Pause</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da7/da7bf41bdbec1a2ab473f48e623d120c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DasNanda"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
