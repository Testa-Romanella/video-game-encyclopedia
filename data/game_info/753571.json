Only one exit if located in each dungeon, so keep your eyes open for any pits that will advance you to the next dungeon. There also a few golden rooms located throughout the dungeon, these require a golden key to unlock, which are located somewhere in the dungeon, but be careful, they are most likely surrounded by some enemies.\u00a0</p><p>Can you make it through this labyrinth with nothing but your trusty crossbow and your quick instincts?\u00a0</p><p>There's only one way to find out...\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T12:00:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b0/3b0634882f7e2ccb9dde7a12b53b8823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mantis"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
