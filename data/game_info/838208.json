Multiple endings and multiple paths to take.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inspired by games such as 'there is no game' and 'The Stanley parable' and made in 3 and a half days for the WOWIE game jam 4.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you enjoy my game and I really appreciate you taking the time to play it.</p>\n<p>If the game is frozen due to quit being pressed, reload the page. The downloaded folder isn't up to date and has some major bugs\u00a0but the web build is fixed. Forget that, I forgot to change an enum and now the web gl build is updated but starts at a different point and can't be reloaded,\u00a0so use the download even though it is missing and ending and a path to one. I can't remove this issues as I can't edit the game now. if you wan't to play the full version, not to review for the jam but to play for fun, go to the updated page:https://gaming-tardigrade.itch.io/harolds-gallery-fixed</p>\n<p>The AI is just an AI in the story\u00a0all the lines and replies were hand crafted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:55:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/dee443c59e3b04389cac55a1e1433ee3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Gaming Tardigrade"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
