But one-time MilaX suggested: \"What if we turned one of our Roleplays into a complete RPG?\"\u00a0I thought that it was a pretty good idea, but once I sat down and try to learn how to use RPG Maker, I quickly learned it wasn't that easy. Then I remembered that we could just use Ren'Py to make a visual novel game about it. MilaX was fine with that. What's funny though is that the game used to just, be a small test for something different we planned.\u00a0It was called: \"hospital story test\" or something. But we both put a lot of effort into it and it seemed really fun already, that i just decided to turn that \"test\" into an actual game. And that's when we actually started to consistently work on it.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Coding by Lenny (itch io: https://rofle44.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Artwork, Background images, and Sprites by Mila X (itch io:\u00a0https://xmilax.itch.io/)</p>\r\nAdditional Credits:\r\n<ul><li>All BGM from Kevin\u00a0Macleod</li><li>Aerosol\u00a0Of\u00a0My\u00a0Love\u00a0by\u00a0Kevin\u00a0MacLeod<br/>Link:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/7013-aerosol-of-my-love\r\nLicense:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\r\nScp\u00a0X3x\u00a0(I\u00a0Am\u00a0Not\u00a0OK)\u00a0by\u00a0Kevin\u00a0MacLeod\r\nLink:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/6733-scp-x3x-i-am-not-ok-\r\nLicense:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0Bleeping\u00a0Demo\u00a0by\u00a0Kevin\u00a0MacLeod\r\nLink:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/song/7012-bleeping-demo\r\nLicense:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\r\nWholesome\u00a0by\u00a0Kevin\u00a0MacLeod\r\nLink:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5050-wholesome\r\nLicense:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0Ether\u00a0Vox\u00a0by\u00a0Kevin\u00a0MacLeod\r\nLink:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/song/7014-ether-vox\r\nLicense:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\r\nDigital\u00a0Lemonade\u00a0by\u00a0Kevin\u00a0MacLeod\r\nLink:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/song/3648-digital-lemonade\r\nLicense:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\r\nNowhere\u00a0Land\u00a0by\u00a0Kevin\u00a0MacLeod\r\nLink:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/song/4148-nowhere-land\r\nLicense:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T07:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae9/ae93b918f69ff884528fa3ba4c885aba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LENNY"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
