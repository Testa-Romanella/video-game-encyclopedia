It's up to you, one of the last psychopomps, to find a way to reopen the gates and restore peace for those that nearly wiped your race from existence. <br/></p>\n<p>The art was made throughout June and the code was slapped together during July. It's far from perfect but it might still be kinda cool, maybe?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Puzzle based level design, laced with story elements.</li><li>Hand-drawn levels (no tiles or heavily repeated props)</li><li>Classic frame-by-frame animation (no tweening or symbols)</li><li>Standard HD resolution (1920 x 1080)</li><li>Full controller support (recommended)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The dialogue cloud at the beginning is bugged out and annoying.
