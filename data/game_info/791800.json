{"id": 791800, "slug": "turbeton", "name": "Turbeton", "name_original": "Turbeton", "description": "Turbeton is a competitive multiplayer game in which two players go head-to-head, waging a strategic fight for control of the Afterlife. Each player drafts a lineup of five Leaders who duke it out to kill the opponent's Shrines. Whoever destroys both of their opponent's Shrines first -- wins!<br/><br/>Each Leader has a unique set of abilities, constantly waging battle as they die and resurrect from the Afterlife. Using multiple Leaders in combination leads to horrifically broken, game-ending combos. <br/><br/><br/><br/>As you fight, players earn Gold which they can use to purchase Relics, further enhancing their army. Relics lend themselves to different playstyles: whether it's going straight for the kill, playing slow and methodical, or creating absolute chaos!<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li>80+ Leaders with unique playstyles</li></ul><ul><li>Free to play!</li></ul><ul><li>Diverse matches due to drafts at the start of the match, where players can choose Leaders from either player's deck to be included in their team</li></ul><ul><li>50+ Relics that add to gameplay diversity</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T08:27:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c6401dbac47000bb8c02f43a5b0fe723.jpg", "website": "https://turbeton.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Calvin Shafer", "Caleb Pecka"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Caleb Pecka", "Calvin Shafer"], "esrb_rating": null}
