Control circles through a maze with dangerous spikes, portals, traps, and more in order to get inside the safe zones and proceed to next stage!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>//</strong></p>\n<p>If you liked this demo, make sure to write us your opinions, ideas, suggestions, and bug fix requests  to this email: platafortgames@gmail.com, so we can analyze and maybe add them to the game!<br/></p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Platafort is a brazillian indie game producer, which has plans to create and publish lots of games!
