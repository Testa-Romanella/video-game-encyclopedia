You are moving in together with another person and must choose what to place in your apartment that will make both of you happy. Both players individually rate the same deck of 20 cards on a scale of how important they think they are, hiding their ratings from the other player. The goal is to then arrange these cards on the shared board in a way that will maximize the happiness of both players. Cards in the Common Room will take the combined value of both players' ratings, while cards in Individual Rooms only take the value of the one who plays them. Each turn you can play one card to the board and discard one card, or discard two cards and bring a card back from the discard pile to the board.<br/></p>\r\nHouse Rules\r\n<p>You can ask your co-op partner what they liked but the partner must use adjectives instead of numbers when answering.</p>\r\nGlobal Game Jam 2019\r\n<p>This project was created over the course of three days during the Global Game Jam 25\u201327.1.2019.
