It's a sci-fi horror game set in not a distant future. Venture on this journey that fills the human race with hope for conquering the stars and find an answer to our origin, even if we are not alone but full of brutal creatures.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>What awaits you?</em></strong>\u00a0ENTROPIA challenges the player to learn the mechanics and the different behaviors of the\u00a0threats. At first, it's not gonna be easy and confusing, well that's what I intend it to be. That being said, the game is based on randomly generated environments and a few unpredictable decisions of the \"AI\". In such a way It doesn't lose the fun factor and tension.\u00a0In other words, with all these elements ENTROPIA offers re-playability.</p>\n<p><strong>Te first chapter is totally free, if you like it you can buy the full game to support me and my work.
