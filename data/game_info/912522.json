Only the best of the best is accepted there. But me?! I may fit the royal part of the title, but regal is not in my vocabulary. I can\u2019t attend this academy! These students are going to eat me up and spit me out while dabbing their lips with handkerchiefs. This academy is perfect. These other students are perfect. Their lives are perfect\u2026</p>\n<p>Right?\r\n</p>\n<p>(Hi, LunarMoon here. Um\u2026this game is something special. I\u2019ve tried to make it as well presented as I can, but there will probably be spelling mistakes and errors galore. Also this is my first time ever using Renpy and I\u2019m not entirely sure of what I\u2019m doing, so please don\u2019t roast me too hard. It\u2019s not Thanksgiving just yet. Primrose Academy is just a prototype of an idea I have and I\u2019m sure a lot of things are going to change if I decide to continue it. So yeah\u2026)\r\n</p>\n<p>(Thanks for checking it out!
