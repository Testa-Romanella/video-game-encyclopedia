Simultaneously. Climate change, am I\u00a0right? In your panic, all you can think to do is run back and forth across the length of the bridge. The fire is burning holes in the bridge, but you did track back in high school and are probably still in amazing shape! Also, somehow the ice is repairing holes in the bridge, so maybe the jumping will be minimal? There's also a glowing green timer below you counting how many seconds have gone by since the storm started. Was someone . . . planning for you to get trapped here?</p>\n<p>Use any PICO-8 button (arrow keys, X/Z)\u00a0to jump over the holes and survive as long as you can.</p>\n<p>This game was created for TweetTweetJam 6, where the game's source code needs to fit in the space of two tweets (560 characters).
