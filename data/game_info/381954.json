You can find gold on the ground, or you must drill into rocks using your buggy to collect the gold.</p>\n<p>Beware that you have a limited amount of battery charge in your buggy, moving and drilling will deplete the charge. You can pay to recharge your buggy at the solar charge pad (an \"X\" on the ground).</p>\n<p>To pay for charge you need to have money. To get money you must sell some gold that you gathered. You can sell gold at the gold deposit/drive-thru.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>You can use WASD or Arrows to move and Spacebar to drill.</p>\n<p>Most screens use either Escape to cancel/pause, and Enter to confirm/unpause.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Design and Art:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://helpcomputer.itch.io/\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/helpcomputer0</p>\n<p>Sound and Music:\u00a0</p>\n<p>http://bibikigarcia.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/BibikiGL\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:13:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bc/1bc16e06422aaf732f5660a189407f9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["helpcomputer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
