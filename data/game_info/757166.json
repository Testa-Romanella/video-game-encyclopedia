Long ago three of the greatest enemies that once brought war and death to our lands, have been magically sealed away within crystals. There they remain to this day, but the seals weaken as the eldest wizard nears the end of his life.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is only one way to stop approaching doom- to do what your ancestor's couldn't and\u00a0 defeat them while they're still contained. Enter their ancient cells and face the terrors of the past.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Experience action-packed top-down combat\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Fight three unique bosses,\u00a0 each fight with different mechanics</p>\n<p>-Defeat them without healing - Every life counts</p>\n<p>-Find the secret ending (Not telling a thing!)</p>\n\n<p>The main idea for this game was born from my deep love for the souls franchise. At some point I asked myself- Could these games still work in 2D?\u00a0 Since most of the time fighting is done on a flat surface, i figured that a lot of aspects of such combat could be re-done in an entirely 2 dimensional setting. First thing that came to mind was a faux-3D game like the original Doom. However, since my skill level is nowhere near high enough to make it, i opted out for a top-down perspective, as it still conveys the 3 dimensional world by removing the vertical axis and onlly using visual tricks to give the feeling of a 3D environment. That was my first attempt at creating such a thing, and i'm sure it could use a lot fo improvement. However, i can proudly say i am happy with how it turned out. I hope you enjoy playing it, and remember- Git Gud.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T08:25:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26d/26df7615c2e4597b37900004bf3b8f8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Revenarine"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
