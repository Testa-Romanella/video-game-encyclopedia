The students\u00a0were tasked with setting up and managing a workflow and production pipeline within their team, and students\u00a0were asked to volunteer for preferred development roles before the project started.\u00a0Two separate project were created\u00a0by five teams consisting of both bachelor and master students, both of which were based on the book Invisible Cities\u00a0by Italo Calvino, where students had to select a description of one of the cities to base their 3D project on.The projects were created in Unity, and the usage of online assets were permitted.\r\n\r\nHypatia, from Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino<br/><br/>Of all the changes of language a traveler in distant lands must face, none equals that which waits him in the city of Hypatia, because the change regards not words, but things. I entered Hypatia one morning, a magnolia garden was reflected in blue lagoons, I walked among the hedges, sure I would discover young and beautiful ladies bathing; but at the bottom of the water, crabs were biting the eyes of the suicides, stones tied around their necks, their hair green with seaweed. I felt cheated and I decided to demand justice of the sultan. I climbed the porphyry steps of the palace with the highest domes, I crossed six tiled courtyards with fountains. The central hall was barred by iron gratings: convicts with black chains on their feet were hauling up basalt blocks from a quarry that opened underground.\r\nProject 2 - Week 3 &amp; 4\r\nGroup 4 members\r\n<p>Milas Norman - Art Director</p>\n<p>Gideon Rimmer - Lead Artist and Game Designer</p>\n<p>Rosa Friholm - 3d Artist and Texture Artist</p>\n<p>Anna R\u00fcth - Concept Artist</p>\n<p>Sofia Holm - Concept Artist</p>\n<p>Jan Janiszewski - Game Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:53:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/560d8af41ef571a1be5a95e5578dd4b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KADKGAME"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
