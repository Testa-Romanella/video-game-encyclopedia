The village has such nice people, and the prince and princess do such a good job with ruling it. Only, there aren\u2019t very many of those people, are there? And what\u2019s with those monsters cropping up everywhere? Wait, weren\u2019t the spirits of the land supposed to be the good guys?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLooks like a lot has changed since the last time you checked in! But after a thousand years, the Festival\u2019s coming up again\u2014celebrating the anniversary of your last epic battle with the island\u2019s other, evil guardian, when your fabled victory brought on a thousand years of peace. Assuming you are the good guardian, of course. Looks like you\u2019d better wake up and prove your mettle. And fast\u2014you\u2019ve only got seven days to set everything right, because that other guardian will be waking up again too, and they\u2019ve likely got their own plans for your beautiful paradise!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo wake up and get to work\u2014traverse the lush forests of your home and take out what monsters you have to, steadily expanding your party of spirits along the way.
