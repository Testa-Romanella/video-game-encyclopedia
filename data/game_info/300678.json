Bub\u201d jalopy!</em>\n<p>GRITS Racing is an <strong>8-player party game</strong> featuring chaotic party mechanics and cars that steer and crash similar to a real car.\u00a0 This is the <strong>most realistic TD/2D racer ever</strong>... except that we then smashed it up into a bizarre party game to appeal to more than just racing fans.\u00a0 <em>We</em> provide a physics playground with sim-like cars, minimal rules (at the start), and <em>you</em> decide what to do with it.\u00a0 Good luck keeping your wheels on!</p>\n<em>Whaaaaat???</em>\n<p>Old school gets a new-school makeover with more damageable physics objects than you can shake a two-dimensional polygon at. \u00a0And, oh, the skids marks! \u00a0Did we mention the oddly-satisfying skid marks that dirty up the track like never before?\u00a0 And the dirt doesn't end there. \u00a0With debris everywhere from lost wheels, broken cars, various track objects, and up to 8 players on one screen generally making a mess of it all, just getting to the finish line can be a friend-testing brawl of gasoline-fueled tenacity.</p>\n<p>Welcome to the petrolpunk world of Globetrotter Racing where it's 1975, The Great War was the only great war, microelectronics do not exist... probably because no one cared about going small after Nikola Tesla and his descendants learned to harness the power of lightning\u2014to put it simply\u2014and invented the Tesla Shield\u2122 for use in automotive safety and generalized pedestrian protection (GPP).</p>\n<p>GRITS Racing is a game for the whole family and if somebody isn't laughing, giggling, snickering, or snorting most of the game... we aren't doing our job correctly.\u00a0 We get it, not all players will choose to race\u2014so we've given them other ways to be part of the environment (for better or for worse).</p>\r\nWhen\r\n<p>Free alpha demo is out now.\u00a0 Early-access alpha is also out now.</p>\r\nWhere\r\n<p>itch.io and Steam and any console we can wreck these cars on.</p>\r\nWhy\r\n<p>Because making up and nixing rules on the playground is really fun.</p>\r\nWho\r\n<p>Brought to you by the cow-skull boneheads at <strong>Muddy

physics:</p>\n<ul><li>These 2D cars actually steer via the wheels!\u00a0 (Unlike nearly all games in this category, which just pivot their cars on center.)\u00a0 You may not <em>see</em> a difference, but take a car for a spin and you will <em>feel</em> it.\u00a0 Quite possibly more realistic than a multiplayer couch game needs to be.</li><li>Car body and wheels modeled as individual physics objects (with proprietary physics code)</li><li>4-wheel drive</li><li>4-wheel steering (rear steering tapers off at speed)</li><li>4-speed transmission (plus reverse) with a torque curve</li><li>430 ft-lbs (582 N-m) of engine torque (subject to change)</li><li>Hand brake on the rear wheels</li><li>Breakable wheel fasteners!\u00a0 (What is it like to drive on 3 wheels and 1 stub axle?\u00a0 How about 1 wheel and 3 stub axles?)</li></ul>\n<p>Smashing 2D barrier physics:</p>\n<ul><li>Several barrier types with different friction coefficients and bounciness</li><li>Not all barriers are nailed down!</li><li>Barriers take damage and show it</li></ul>\n<p>Gripping 2D surface physics:</p>\n<ul><li>Several surface types with different traction coefficients and drag coefficients</li><li>Dry, wet, and oily variants</li><li>Oil slicks appear organically when and where cars are broken apart during the race</li><li>Oil doesn't artificially wipe you out but only makes whichever tires touch it slick (the wipe outs are up to you)</li><li>Oil slickness on tires tapers off over distance</li><li>Skid and tire marks vary in width by direction and vary in color by surface</li></ul>\n<p>Mayhem Model 1-A:</p>\n<ul><li>Pancake batter!!!*</li><li>Pit stops to apply more pancake batter and replace missing wheels</li><li>Cars can be broken apart when abandoned</li><li>4 cars per race (run to your trucks to launch your next car)</li><li>Tesla Shields\u2122 (can't have drivers being hit and injured as they run for their next car, can we?)</li><li>Tesla Shields\u2122 (worth mentioning again because the counter force can be very bad for the car that hits one)</li><li>Le Mans starts (well, more of a cute feature than chaos-making)</li><li>Not all barriers are nailed down!\u00a0 (wait, we said that already)</li><li>Up to 8 players on one screen</li><li>Bubba Prizes!</li><li>Save and share game photos showing off the mess ya'll made of the track</li></ul>\n<p>Mayhem Model

cars \u2022\u00a0Dragster chutes \u2022\u00a0and many more to come</li><li>Leader Lamifiers that force \u201con-fire\u201d players to add a rule to make things more difficult for the race leader, like:\u00a0 \u2022 Leader trikes \u2022\u00a0Finish-line showboating required \u2022\u00a0and more to come</li><li>See devlog: Announcing the Beginnings of Mayhem Model 2!</li></ul>\n<p>Prison Dodgecar minigame:</p>\n<ul><li>Tesla Shields\u2122 installed on the car instead of the driver</li><li>Like bumper cars meets billiards</li></ul>\n<p>Hockey minigame (<em>Sansst\u00edkdisco</em> in some countries):</p>\n<ul><li>Tesla Magnets\u2122 for run-n-gun puck control</li></ul>\n<p>* <strong>The pancake batter story.</strong>\u00a0 Many years ago a racer was having trouble with the wheel lug nuts staying tight.\u00a0 So, in desperation, he was looking about his pit area for a new idea to fix it when he spied his leftover pancake batter from breakfast.\u00a0 He thought \u201cIt couldn't possibly be any worse, could it?\u201d\u00a0 Well, actually, yes, it was worse.\u00a0 Much worse.\u00a0 But the crowd loved the results and the rest is lost in history.\u00a0 No one remembers for sure who this racer was but legend has it he was called Juan Tabo.\u00a0 Official records proving the existence of Jaun Tabo have yet to be found but this hasn't stopped governments from naming libraries and schools in his honor.</p>\n<p>The sport, then known as Wiggle Wheel Wacing, languished in the backwoods of the Southern United States for years before Gilded-Age billionaire, Billy Bub Worcestershire, bought the rights to it and turned it into the mid-budget international sport known as Globetrotter Racing.\u00a0 Mr. Worcestershire had previously made his fortune with the invention and popularization of deep-fried grits biscuits and, as he stated it, \u201cI understand food batter and believe in the future of all its lucrative properties.\u201d\u00a0 Deep-fried grits also became the sport's official snack food.\u00a0 When the Tesla's later invented the <em>personal plasma energy shield</em> (PPES), or Tesla Shield\u2122, Mr. Worcestershire incorporated these shields into Globetrotter Racing and this variant, coincidently, became known as GRITS (Globetrotter Racing Incorporated, \u00e1 la Tesla Shields).</p>\n<br/>\r\nEarly access\r\n Steam key included with itch.io
