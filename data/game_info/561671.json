Especially a multiplayer, but technically a single player. Confusing right? Well, THE DARK is a single/multiplayer player game which has two avatars, but both can be controlled by a single/multiple person(s). This game has four levels, in which the player has to find and solve the puzzles to get out of that room. Clues are present in both avatar\u2019s play space. Unless the clues from both the sides are found, the player can\u2019t get out of that room.\u00a0 Be aware that the player has to form a word/number from the clues he/she found to crack the puzzle. Ready to experience the brain crushing puzzle?
