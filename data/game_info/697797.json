You take control of a robed wanderer, on his way to the top of the castle, filled with dreams of taking the throne for himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, it's likely he won't make it, for the road is filled with perils. He will leave his body behind in a pit full of spikes, or get killed by one of the castle's traps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily, for every wanderer killed, a new will come, hoping that you can guide him towards his goal. Each of the bodies that will pile up, will make for a convenient platform, and will stay there forever, waiting to be used as a stepping stone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find secret passages, unlock shortcuts and explore the open world. Soon you will find that the castle may not be the only place worth dying for. How many bodies will you pile up, just to reach the top of the world?</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>-Explore an open world and discover its secrets.</p>\n<p>-Unlock shortcuts to make your way towards the throne just a bit easier.</p>\n<p>-Unlock in-game trophies as a proof of your achivements.</p>\n<p>-Collect items! (And leave them behind alongside your body as you perish...)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for GLJ Game Parade Fall 2021, following the theme \"<strong>Leave Something Behind</strong>\".</p>\n\n<p>Small footnote, this is my first time taking a part in a Game Jam, as well as my first finished game. I have been working with Unity for almost a year now, but this is the first time that any of my creations gets to see the light of day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When I started working on the project a week ago, i had it planned as something much bigger, but time soon showed me how things really are. Big thanks to my girlfriend Anna, who worked just as hard with background and cover art.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wanted to link her artist Twitter here, but she expicitely told me not to do it. Looks like her online persona will remain a mystery for the time being.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T04:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbc/cbc9e85ae28e2c74c31c95cbc8191528.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revenarine"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
