One for ship that you control and other for enemies getting past the screen. The game has three enemy types and three power ups.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I didn't have time to make more levels or fine tune them better. I'm not even sure if the last level is possible so good luck! <br/><br/>Sadly there's no music or sounds this time. Maybe I should spend couple next weekends on more fuller game. We'll see.<br/><br/>WASD - Move<br/>Space - Shoot<br/>Q - Shoot missile (if get the powerup)<br/><br/>Controller is also supported. <br/><br/>PS: The game is not mobile friendly at all. It also depends on the specific screen size.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:54:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a5/0a597312ce4e7a3b5186baab004f45b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lsr351"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
