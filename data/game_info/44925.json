There you are, as Benito Retamosa, such a lazy, cheeky student, more interested in partying than in reading Aristotle. On your adventures through College, you will have to meet Mr. Gustavo Bueno, an ancient master of Philosophy you will need to overcome your mission.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll texts in game are translated into English but the spanish voices have been left as they were, to provide the player with an atmosphere as close as possible to the original version. Soundtrack is funny as well and all graphics have been designed with Microsoft Paint. What else do you need to be told to download this work and immerse yourself in the magical world of a engagingly roguish hero?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/927/927442bb3c48b71cac5b4c8f5b4ae6eb.jpg", "website": "https://www.videojuegosfermin.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 117, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Videojuegos Ferm\u00edn", "videojuegos_fermin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Videojuegos Ferm\u00edn"], "esrb_rating": null}
