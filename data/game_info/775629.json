Well think again, literally!</p>\n<p>Double Negative tasks you with completing numerous mini-games to assist in a neurological scientist's research. These mini-games, so they say, help stimulate and train the brain to be smarter, faster and more critical. However... this scientist is determined to make the project fail at any cost to prevent it going in the wrong hands. With their hands legally tied behind their back, it's up to you to prove that these mini-games are just a bunch of hot air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How, you ask?\u00a0Oh it's easy. Just do the opposite of what the mini-game is trying to tell you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It wants you to go right, you go left.</p>\n<p>It wants you to not shoot a target, you intentionally hit the target.</p>\n<p>It wants you to don't not keep the door shut, you... uh... do something?</p>\n<p>Keep your brain on your toes to help this scientist, or the higher-ups might begin to notice something's off!</p>\n\n<p>(This title is currently in very early stages of development. What has been posted so far is a proof-of-concept for the design of the title and not the final representation of the finished product.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T11:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d0/1d07a970ba12623c349edb2e2be6c4d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Icido"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
