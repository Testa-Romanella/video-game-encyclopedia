That was a workout! This time I took the compo to learn how to make a full Godot project. There\u2019s a lot of carry-over from how I structured projects in Unity, but it worked out really well! Also, forgot to add \u2018Protect the gold!\u2019 at the beginning of the game. Whoops! Might have to update that later.</p>\n<p>Hope you all have fun with my game. Have a wonderful day, and I can\u2019t wait to see what you all made :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T04:06:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdc51ff3101eae3a2c8484c056c3f6be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Phobos001"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
