Game's still WIP :)</p><p>It's multiplayer hotseat game similar to Liero, Soldat and Worms. So the terrain is destructible, you have multiple weapons (after you collect powerup crate) and there's plenty of silly action. As the theme states there's only one screen (randomly generated) and it's looped on sides!</p><p>You can play up to 4 players at once (after configuring controls before starting game).</p><p>Default controls:</p><p>Player 1: Arrows + Shift (Fire), Ctrl (Jetpack), / (Change weapon)</p><p>Player 2: WSAD + 2 (Fire), 1 (Jetpack), TAB (Change weapon)</p><p>If you want to play with joysticks : joystick number 1 must replace player 1 controls, Joystick number 2 must replace player 2 controls! Axes are configured, you only need to setup buttons.</p><p>Browser version: http://gamejolt.com/games/arcade/beautiful-yoga-ex...<br/></p><p>Credits:</p><p>code,gfx,idea: nosferathoo</p><p>gfx: Paulina</p>music: DADi ( https://soundcloud.com/mcdadi , https://www.facebook.com/1dadi?fref=ts ) - big thanks!<p>~~</p><p>mindhelix.pl | kontakt@mindhelix.pl<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35e/35eaa9404335267c69fa5f2089bb80b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["nosferathoo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
