{"id": 178801, "slug": "nsa-4096", "name": "NSA 4096", "name_original": "NSA 4096", "description": "<p>Inspired by xkcd #538 \"Security\" (https://xkcd.com/538/).<br/><br/></p>\n<p>NSA 4096 is a game based around a 100-level dungeon. It's part RPG, part dungeon crawler, and fairly difficult. Difficulty ramps up faster than you do, if you're not careful. Watch out for status effects and bullets that can go through walls. I doubt anyone will get past level 40, but if you do, let me know in a comment!</p>\n<p>Levels are procedurally-generated, and enemies are randomized, so you will always have a slightly different adventure. I thought about adding permadeath, but figured people would end up punching their computer screens if they died anywhere past level 20. I might update later with a NewGame+ option that has permadeath, if enough people request it.</p>\n<p>The game should be pretty much done for now, though I haven't done a full play-through just yet (seriously, it's a long, frustratingly difficult grind to level 100 :P ). If you find any major bugs, please let me know!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use ARROW keys to move.<br/></p>\n<p>Press LEFTSHIFT to run.</p>\n<p>Press SPACE to interact/open boxes/confirm an action.</p>\n<p>Press S-key to attack.</p>\n<p>Press ESC to open the menu (or cancel an action).</p>\n\n<p>Check the ReadMe file for asset attributions and acknowledgements!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8c/e8c327df4ff2311e8b5d945c90f619cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iostorm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
