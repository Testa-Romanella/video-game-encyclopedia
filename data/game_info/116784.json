I hope you all enjoy the game. Currently development has ground to a halt, but if you'd like to see more updates or any suggestions then just let me know. I know the game's difficulty balancing needs a little tweaking and that will be a priority in a weeks time.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS: </strong><br/>-Mouse (left clicking does mostly everything). <br/>-Space Bar uses up one turn. <br/>-The Pickup GUI component lies at the bottom middle of the screen and it may be a little hard to see. </p>\n<p><strong>HELP: </strong><br/>-The Aim of the game is to get as far down as you can. <br/>-The Level reloads when you reach the downwards stairs. <br/>-The Slimes get harder to kill as you descend so stock up on health potions and find a better piece of metal to cut them down with!!! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b55c146b4d4ca17fa025fd2e234608f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["7stepto"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
