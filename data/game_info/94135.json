In the world of ASTROKILL, kinetic weapons dominate the battlefield. Deliver destruction with machine guns, flak cannons, homing missiles and rail guns. You will wipe out entire squads and bring down frigates in glorious explosions. But, be wary of camping interceptors, homing space-mines, and ace-pilots.<br/><br/>To survive, you will master your spacecraft and strategically manage your squad. Command squad-members to guard areas or strictly hold positions. By flying as a medic, you will repair and rearm your fellow wingmen. Protect yourself from enemy fire with anti-gravity. Use asteroids and debris as concealment from enemy-detection. Support friendly capital-ships as they reign down hellfire on enemy-positions. And, above all us, out-maneuver and outgun all who cross your path.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Playable space fighters, interceptors, gunships, and medics</li><li>Enemies include capital ships, outposts, freighters, turrets, space mines, and squads of fighters</li><li>Ballistic weapons: machine guns, flak cannons, homing missiles, and rail guns</li><li>True 6DoF flight-controls via directional thrusters</li><li>Projectile-repelling anti-gravity shields unique to ASTROKILL</li><li>Clever and convincing AI with a range of skill-levels</li><li>Fully customizable controls: mouse, keyboard, gamepad, and joystick</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/497/497cce1493d7aa06edf25f168083bbfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 405, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Doomsday Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
