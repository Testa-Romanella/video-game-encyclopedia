Hopefully that will help you out a bit in knowing what is ahead of you. The game is intentionally difficult so the end feels like more of a reward; apologies for any frustration you may receive from this :)</p><br/>\n<p><strong>Created for Juice Jam II</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to play our little game!</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Web GL version loses some visuals due to not supporting compute shaders.
