The distance constructs both our similarities and differences. The distance can be extended to\u00a0an\u00a0astronomical unit, and the planet becomes small even if it carries all of our memories. Flying over small planets is a meditation about where to come and where to go since both Finland &amp; Korea are on the blue earth. Driving a propeller plane,\u00a0it is your challenge to find our planet among those.</strong></p>\r\nFrom Unity Asset Store\r\n<p>Dark Singularity</p>\n<p>Effect textures and prefabs</p>\n<p>Real Stars Skybox Lite</p>\n<p>Stylized Planet-Pack Full</p>\n<p>Stylize Water Texture</p><p>Dotween</p>\r\nOther Assets\r\n<p>Toy Plane, CC BY 4.0, Modified:</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/toy-plane-8e07cd514f1148269ca715b8e726ace2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T07:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a9f8f0d85f91c550cfb2b081e8f9387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dazi77"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
