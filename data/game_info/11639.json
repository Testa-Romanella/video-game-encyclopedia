It won't have amazing game play or some deep thoughts but completeness and a bit of fun. It would be great for me if someone like the game. <br/>\r\nPS: Thanks to Arcadia for translation of in game text and steam store page. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\r\nProvide auto-saving at the end of each day, you can continue playing by clicking \"continue\" button. But there's only one slot, when you start new game, old profile would be cover-written.<br/>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHotkey:<br/>\r\n1. Use \"Max\" button to set the max buy in quantity of current item conveniently.<br/>\r\n2. Use \"Q\" or right click to close current panel.<br/>\r\n3. Use \"A\" and \"D\" to control item number.<br/>\r\n4. Use \"W\" and \"S\" to control the right scroll bar.<br/>\r\n5. Use \"E\" to return home| anytime.<br/>\r\n6. Use \"F\" to show bulletin board.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame Tips:<br/>\r\n1.Make more money in limited days.<br/>\r\n2.Item price will only change after one day passed.<br/>\r\n3.Each item will have a random top and bottom price cap. These two values won't change in one play through.<br/>\r\n4.Hoarding an item will cause its price increase. Notice that events also affect price. So it might not increase.<br/>\r\n5.Dumping an item will cause its price decrease. Similarly it's not guaranteed.<br/>\r\n6.Lower price is very likely to cause stronger rebound.<br/>\r\n7.If not affected by former rules , Price move direction is a 50/50.<br/>\r\n8.Higher base price, higher variation. It's all based on percentage.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's just a mini-game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac4bb3618a035792bf012bdb7c1d36b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 46, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 89, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u75af\u738b\u5b50"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u75af\u738b\u5b50\u4e2d\u4e8c\u96c6\u56e2\u603b\u90e8"], "esrb_rating": null}
