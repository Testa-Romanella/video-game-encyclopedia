They are all from www.freesound.org and they are amazing!</p>\n<p>Also i want to thank the Epic Games Team, because without the Unreal Engine it would be impossible for me to create games like this so easily. <br/>And i want to thank the producer of this sick remix of SOLO by Demi Lovato and Clean Bendit which i used in the trailer\u00a0\u00a0.. you are amazing man!<br/>Here is the Link to the official remix:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQguy...</p>\n<p>At last i want to thank Virtus for his amazing tutorials ..
