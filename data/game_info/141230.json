You move left and right and press a button to change the background color to navigate the path. The platforms you stand are either hidden or shown depending on the background color. They are still there, even if you cant see them! This was developed to be primarily used for an iPhone but has not been approved by Apple yet. This will be up only for the preliminary build, as most other updates will be on the iPhone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5e/d5e2136f185f36f10c4570dfa4dc73fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ieatcheeese"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
