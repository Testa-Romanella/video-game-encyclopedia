The rules/controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Use <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong>\u00a0to point in a direction, and <strong>SPACE</strong> to fire a laser</li><li>You will recoil backwards one grid space, or two if you're directly facing a wall (black square, or edges of room) or a box (brown square). Running into a wall or box will stop your movement</li><li>If you fire at a mirror (the gray rectangle), it will reflect and destroy you</li><li>Use the <strong>B</strong> key to drop a box into the grid space you are facing. A box will act like a wall, but will be destroyed after one laser hit</li><li>You have limited laser shots (\"L:__\") and boxes to drop (\"B:__\"). If you run out of lasers before reaching the goal, you will have to retry</li><li>The <strong>R</strong> key will restart a level at any time</li></ul><p>Made by me in GameMaker Studio for LOWREZJAM 2020.
