And sound settings don't save.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hitting pause in the main level removes the quest widget\u00a0 for \"Molecules Left\".\u00a0 The quest is still active, but it just doesn't show.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are some molecules that can't be reached that are near a mushroom. You'll have to restart the game and hopefully it doesn't prop up too high. This is because I add a random number to its height, and well, it sometimes gets the max value and I didn't test it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The particles really slow down on my computer when entering rage mode. Hopefully, it will run okay on yours!</p>\n\n<p>Lore (Spoilers...sort of?):</p>\n<p>You play as Mother Nature and she has been frozen in an icy cave in the north pole. But recently, the greenhouse gases CO2, CFC, and methane has melted her out of slumber and she has awoken to destroy the molecules. She must kill all of those molecules. She must...mole-KILL them all TO D3TH.
