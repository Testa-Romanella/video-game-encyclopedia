Its the first game I made since I started learning about video game programming. I plan to do more with this like add more levels, improve the art, add a level select , pause menu and death screen. As well as new physics to add to each level.\u00a0<br/><br/>This is a rocket navigation game where you fly around the level trying to get to the end platform. Each level will have its own challenge. Whether its a narrow gap, moving platform , closing windows of opportunities or timing a cycle just right. Other types might include a timed run, or the level shrinking to the point where it also acts like a timed run. You can save progress by completing a level and then coming back to a level select menu.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c5/6c54d47b162087a8e88bde1d915c9ea3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheLegendd27"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
