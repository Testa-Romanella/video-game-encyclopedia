To grow, you need to eat the red dots. Each time you eat, your worm gets longer.\u00a0But there is a catch: if you touch your tail, you die.\u00a0<br/><br/>NEW GAME MECHANICS<br/>+ Swipe to control your worm<br/>+ We introduce a level system. The amount of segments appended to your worm depends on the level you're in. Level 1 appends 1 segment, level 2 appends two segments and so on. This sounds simple but gets very hard very soon!<br/><br/>Enjoy a classic with a twist and time travel to the 80s!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T01:55:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0f/b0f5ac8455d6cb28a76b9eb9cdf39d5d.jpg", "website": "https://www.instagram.com/dracoexmachina", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Stefan Hoppe"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Family"], "publishers": ["Stefan Hoppe"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
