Press SPACE (or keep pressed) to fire bullets. If you've destroyed a wave of 3 or 4 enemies, it spawns a green upgrade. Statues on the planet surface also spawn upgrades.\u00a0Pick them up. Press ENTER to choose the upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Story</strong></p>\n<p>It's the year 2147. Scientists discover some kind of portal in the solar system. They send a small spaceship to investigate. Bigger and better armed ships can't go through the portal. There's a small crew on board; with the best and most courageous pilots and technicians. The latter will be able to collect raw energy and materials and upgrade the spaceship. No doubt the journey will be dangerous.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The spaceship called Courage sets off to explore...</p>\n<p><strong>Mini Jam #77</strong></p>\n<p>This was the first jam ever I've participated in. It was really great fun! It was my son's birthday on the third day, so I knew time was short. I had to make something not to difficult, because I was eager to finish the game.</p>\n<p>The time restraints and the theme 'Can't take place on Earth'\u00a0made me think of the old Konami games I played on my brother's MSX computer, a looooong time ago... My game is heavily inspired by Nemesis by Konami. Not very original, but I knew I could finish a decent game in two days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is quite hard, something you're not supposed to do in a game jam... But I felt it needed it, since the original games were also brutally difficult and saving your game was not possible.</p>\n<p>On the third day, I quickly recorded a theme song and an intro song. Everything (art, engine, sound) was made from scratch. I've used microStudio to code the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T06:02:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bd/9bd11e44fd691c05f32197ff9e28ac69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Six Strings"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
