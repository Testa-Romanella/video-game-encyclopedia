When will it become a full game?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Great question. We think this idea has legs and are considering ways we could expand it out into a full experience. Part of our desire to get this into people\u2019s hands early is to find out how viable the core mechanics are and how much appetite there would be for a full game. If this is right up your alley, let us know!</p>\n<p>You can even Wishlist the game on Steam already to register your interest.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Can I reach out with thoughts and suggestions for where this could go in the future?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Yes, absolutely.
