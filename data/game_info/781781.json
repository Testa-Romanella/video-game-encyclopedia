With only about a month into learning the engine and game dev as a whole,\u00a0not bad for a dad in his thirties with no time on his hands. I even did the art and music.</p>\n<p>I had hoped for it to have more but I am still happy with what I got. Controls are a little wonky and its only got one level. but for a prototype I'm happy with it.</p>\n<p>I'm probably gonna have to rebuild form the ground up to make it what I want it to be but I'm pretty sure I can do that. At the very least I will get it to where I thought I could take it at the beginning of the jam.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T21:07:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f34/f347636f3b46464600521c1e29049aeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TinyCastleDesigns"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
