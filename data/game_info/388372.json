{"id": 388372, "slug": "adam-robot-world", "name": "Adam: Robot World", "name_original": "Adam: Robot World", "description": "Adam: Robot World is a game of building strongholds, trading or warfare with other strongholds, and seeking survival in a world controlled by artificial intelligence. On a planet abandoned by humans, in a world of robots, humans have placed a series of robotic strongholds for waste collection, and the Justicar Robot supervises the world to prevent robots from evolving superintelligence threatening the human world. However, when the Justicar mutate, it will be a disaster.<br/><br/>When Adam wakes up in an abandoned stronghold, you have to arrange for Adam and his robotic companions joining the city to recycle waste and make products; trade with other strongholds to survive and develop; attack mutant Justicar and robbers, build factories and defensive buildings, fight against enemy attacks, and win the final war over the Justicar base.<h3>GAME POSITIONING</h3>This is a construction and operation game that includes battles between strongholds. You need to balance the optimization of production efficiency and the improvement of military strength. The game is easy to play, but it's not easy to win in the end. Your stronghold won't die out because of a single defeat, but can be rebuilt quickly, which makes you always reach the final battle. But if the development is not fast enough, you will not win in the final battle. In fact, it is normal for ordinary players to win the final battle through multi-generations game. Some items can be inherited between generations to help you become stronger and stronger. At the same time, the world of each generation will be re-randomized, so the construction and development strategy will be different every time.<h3>GAME CONTENT</h3><ul><li>Build factories to recycle all kinds of waste left by human beings for reproduction.</li></ul><ul><li>Maximizes production efficiency by planning the distribution of buildings, roads and robots.</li></ul><ul><li>Trades with other strongholds to obtain electricity.</li></ul><ul><li>Rescue and accept different robotic partners and increase your hands.</li></ul><ul><li>Unlocks buildings, robotic components, various production technologies and combat technologies in technological tree.</li></ul><ul><li>Arm your robots, attack Justicar and robber robots'strongholds for resources.</li></ul><ul><li>Use defensive buildings to protect your strongholds.</li></ul><ul><li>Collect the remains of human civilization, and they will enhance your strength.</li></ul><ul><li>If you lose in the final war, a powerful magnetic storm will bring everything back to its original point. Only the civilization remains will be handed down from generation to generation to help you defeat the Justicar in the next round of the game.</li></ul><ul><li>Please take care of your robots. When they have wisdom, they will have their own joys and sorrows.</li></ul><ul><li>30 + buildings can be unlocked and constructed.</li></ul><ul><li>120 robotic components can be replaced.</li></ul><ul><li>200 + technologies for unlocking.</li></ul><ul><li>40 + Robots with different functional modules (skills).</li></ul><h3> GAME FEATURES</h3><ul><li>The core of  operations is the location of buildings and road planning, which will greatly impress productivity, and if you want, there will always be room for improvement.</li></ul><ul><li>Because production depends on the transport behavior of robots between different buildings, rather than a simple mathematical model, you can't get a definite productivity result. You need to observe production and then calculate or plan by instinct.</li></ul><ul><li>Story mode uses a fixed map to take you into the robot's mental journey.</li></ul><ul><li>Free mode uses random maps, and different terrain, resource distribution and climate change bring you different game experiences.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T02:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e0/0e03ffcb2b33065fba6ccc4ffced7ed8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 411, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZGame Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ZGame Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
