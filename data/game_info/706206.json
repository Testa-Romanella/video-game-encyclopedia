I have created the bare basic game play that can be played locally with 2 people.</p>\n<p>To play the game simply try to get 3 in a row.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The twist? There are 3 sizes of game pieces: Large, Medium, Small. The size is what matters ;).... no really, This twist on the game brings tons of different strategies.</p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>The bigger sizes can go over the smaller ones only. So Medium can go over small, but no larger. You cannot place the same size piece over one another. For Example, a Large and a Large do not stack, so you have to plan and use your pieces wisely! I hope you enjoy this Prototype and follow the development.</p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions for additional gameplay/mechanics/themes. Place a comment and it may be in the next release!</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>BixTheDev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T14:55:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aa005b38ed98b478d654fba72024294.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BixTheGameDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
