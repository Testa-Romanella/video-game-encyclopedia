It's always been a dream of mine to make a game, and one day in the summer of 2019 I just decided to do it.<br/>(Insert Shia Labeouf's \"just do it\" meme here).<br/><br/>I've already come a long way. I've made multiple mobile games and some game jam games which have helped me learn a tremendous amount about game development, Unity engine, pixel art, and animation. But from the very beginning, I have wanted to make a commercial release around Haiku and his world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-23T11:58:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f0/1f03437c01964351b6d102f7f853c8e9.jpg", "website": "https://mistermorris.games/", "rating": 3.38, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 125, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mister Morris Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mister Morris Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
