Once home to an ancient alien civilization, you have been sent to support the research team. However, upon waking from your long cryo sleep, you discover that something has gone horribly, fatally wrong in the base beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Set in the distant future, advanced contact lenses are now commonplace, and are used as one of the main forms of computing. Owing to the specific light frequency emitted, the alien inside the base is able to sense when you are nearby. Your only hope for survival is to keep your eyes closed and not get too close.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Narrative driven cinematic experience<br/></li><li>An incredible and chilling soundtrack composed by Matthew Javanshir<br/></li><li>Immersive sound effects<br/></li><li>Voice logs with subtitles<br/></li><li>Between 1 and 1.5 hours playtime</li></ul><br/>Made with Unity.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T10:25:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0f/e0ffd8916cac5a6cecf6ff70b391c982.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Propulsion Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Propulsion Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
