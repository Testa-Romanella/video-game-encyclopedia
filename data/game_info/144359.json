The faster you play the more you score and the harder it gets. Try it, fail and try again.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe rules are simple: Merge any two chips and score. Watch the distances of the surrounding chips. \r\n\t<strong>Every chip needs a neighbor</strong>. Play the shrinking chips as the game also ends when you are out of chips. The quicker you merge chips the higher your score will be.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Chip Clash for desktop is still under development.</strong> I'm planning to integrate a leaderboard and achievement system like the android version has.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tFeel free to contact me: \r\n\tcontact@horsed.org | @mknpf\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dc/6dc548b4374e7e8153fc869beb45459c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["flat button"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
