Three hours since a treacherous colleague stole your sandwich.<br/>The last time you saw your lunch it was around midday. By 13:00pm, the fridge was bare. Interrogate your suspects. Search for clues. Identify the culprit. But beware! Everyone has a secret...<br/></p>\n<p><em>Theme: Spooky, bread</em><br/><em>Wildcards: Delightfully mundane and include a cheat code.</em><br/></p>\n<p>The HTML version may have laggy audio - if you're having issues, please download the downloadable versions. <br/></p>\n<p>Please note, this project is unpolished with two rooms cut. The story is unaffected and the game can still be finished. We may complete it in a post-jam update.</p>\n<p><em>Made by:<br/>SarahSsss7#9089,<br/>Sophiablabla#7563<br/>hnuqweasd#3731</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e4/0e4807d87b5e30ee72c4dd006d69ee23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["sage7"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
