Brave knights will serve you, but our defenses are all out of place. Use your powerful magic to lead our troops to victory in this chaotic strategy game.</p>\n<p>Click on two tiles with your mouse to swap them, including all enemies, allies and walls. Note that some tiles cannot be swapped. Pause the game by hitting the space bar.</p>\n\n<p>Hints:</p>\n<ul><li>Numbers win battles! Gather your forces while isolating your enemies to fight efficiently.</li><li>When heading towards the treasure, skeletons use the shortest path. They can destroy walls but they are lazy. They would rather walk 10 tiles than attack a wall at full health.</li><li>If the chaos get overwhelming, pause the game to forge a strategy. You can use this powerful Time spell by hitting the Space bar (something something spacetime).</li></ul>\n<p>This game was created in 72 hours for the Completion Jam (hosted by Deynum Studio: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCliACYjYqDt7yqSXKo4f4fQ).</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Elthen's Pixel Art Shop (https://itch.io/profile/elthen) | Map and Portal Sprites</p>\n<p>pipoya (https://itch.io/profile/pipoya) | Knight and Skeleton Sprites</p>\n<p>Daniel Linssen (https://managore.itch.io/) | Font</p>\n<p>chippy01302 (https://itch.io/profile/chippy01302) | Background Music</p>\n<p>Kronbits (https://itch.io/profile/kronbits) | Win and Loose SFX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:01:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/073/0734a86a2ef6f52e20da537e83724dcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["fourtyTwoIsNotEnough"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
