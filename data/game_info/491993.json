Every choice made by the player is a whisper into the deep recesses of the protagonist\u2019s brain, compelling him to actions which he, or you, might disagree with.<br/><br/><strong>\u2666 Introspect \u2666</strong><br/>Get to know the protagonist as you converse directly with him; understand his opinions, challenge his views, change his mind, or have him change yours\u2026 or root yourselves in your beliefs as you grow further apart.<br/><br/>Reflect on your actions along with the protagonist; exchange your thoughts on what happened; regret or rejoice, grieve or laugh together\u2026 or independently of each other.<br/><br/><strong>\u2666 Choices &amp; Consequences \u2666</strong><br/>There is no \u201cMission Failed\u201d; saying \u201cNo\u201d opens new avenues. There is no golden path.<br/><br/>Almost every single choice, no matter how small, has a consequence. Lie to others, and you\u2019ll be more likely to hide the truth from yourself. Fail to justify your actions and you might find your character not heeding your commands.<br/><br/><strong>\u2666 Narrative &amp; Dialogue \u2666</strong><br/>Sprawling, naturally flowing dialogue: react in intense back-and-forth conversations.<br/><br/>Every dialogue is ready for the choices you make, and can potentially branch off into a completely different conversation with game-changing significance.<br/><br/><strong>\u2666 Explore &amp; Survive \u2666</strong><br/>Explore the mysterious island, unravel its secrets and lies. Shrouded in noxious, mind-altering mist, you must prepare for every journey inland, anticipating the challenges ahead. The provisions are scarce\u2026 but the others need them less than you.<br/><br/>You\u2019re NOT fully in control. You are the whisper in the back of the mind. Manipulate your crew-mates and your protagonist into doing your bidding\u2026 and deal with the mental toll with this innovative dialogue dynamic.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T03:14:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dcc038366fbfc29c0293c99eaeeed6b.jpg", "website": "https://www.wherebirdsgotosleep.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quiet Little Feet"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Quiet Little Feet"], "esrb_rating": null}
