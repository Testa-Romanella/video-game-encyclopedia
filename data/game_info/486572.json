Regrettably, my scope ended up becoming so big as I kept building upon my design document coupled with\u00a0the main issue of getting the main mechanic to work (that ended up taking a whole day to fix). I can only confidently call what\u00a0I submit a prototype.</p>\n<p>If you are here, I would like to thank you for checking out this page and if you downloaded the project; thank you so much for wanting to try it out. I definitely plan to continue working on this project and have more of a complete form of the game mechanically at a later date,</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended:\u00a0</strong>Play in Windowed Mode. The Aspect Ratio will not be good on Fullscreen though the game is playable.<br/></p>\n<p>You can turn off the Touch UI, I forgot to check to see if I could turn it off by default</p>\n<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>\n<p>A scholar named Raena has recently discovered a building belonging to an age now called the Lost Era. The towering monolith is overgrown with flora, overrun with monsters, and a mysterious woman who walks the halls.</p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<p>The game is playable with Keyboard or just your Mouse.</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys </strong>are for movement and menu selection.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Enter\u00a0</strong>is the \"Action Button\" you would use to activate events, open chests, etc.<br/></p>\n<p>Hold down the <strong>Shift</strong> key, Raena will dash.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(My apologies, but I am not sure if I can change the key through the default engine as of right now, but I will look into it as I further develop it.)</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Using the Mouse, you click anywhere and the sprite will move automatically.\u00a0Clicking on chests, shopkeeps, etc. will also play their events as well.</p>\r\nIn case you get stuck:\r\n<p>I'm sorry I didn't explain much of anything in this build but to get out of the lobby, take the vines next to the elevator.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Special Thanks to Extra Credits for hosting the Take Care Game Jam!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to the VisuStella Team for the Plug-Ins, which made the Main Mechanic of this game possible\u00a0</strong>and also added several Quality of Life Improvements to the Engine itself</p>\n<p><strong>Please check out their amazing work at the links below:</strong></p>\n<p>https://visustella.itch.io/visumz-sample</p>\n<p>http://www.yanfly.moe/wiki/Category:Visustella</p>\n<p>I used the RPG Maker MZ Engine for this game. If you'd like to try it out or see what it offers,\u00a0<br/>check out the link: https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mz</p>\n<p>Thank you to Adon &amp; RedWeaver for showcasing On Map Encounters. Even though it was for VX Ace, it can still work\u00a0for\u00a0RPG Maker MZ.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs/Issues:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>I am aware of the that the vines that decorate the walls on the upper floor can lead to the player (and some enemies) climbing on the \"roof\" of the map</strong></p>\n<p>The cutscene on the 2nd floor immediately switches to battle processing. This is something I am looking into but did not have the time to fix before the submission</p>\n<p>The stress state\u00a0<strong>will</strong> have a visual indicator and I'm sorry I couldn't get that done before hand.</p>\n<p><strong>The Stress Mechanic</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0I think I didn't\u00a0fully explain this in my prototype (I think) but the main mechanic is that after being in many battles Raena will develop \"Stress\" (it's only winning/running away from battles for now, I plan on fleshing it out but ran out of time to flesh it out).</p>\n<p>Stress can not be removed via a recovery spell, it can only be removed by taking a break. For now the only way to dispel it is to; rest in the bed at Ade's Shop (the one with the blue hexagram icon), eat at said shop, or pet the cat outside the smithy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>More ways to relieve stress are planned such as;\u00a0taking a break in certain rest areas in the main dungeon to keep the player from only having to go into town too much (a teleport to town and to any previously explored dungeon floors is planned ) .</p>\n<p>Regrettably, I think I bite off too much and had a hard time chewing because for now the state applies and is removed how I wanted and need it to be, but it needs a visual indication for players to see and that is something I am going to reach out to others about.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:37:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c60/c60e4f96e9b1c9bdf7e43f772cc7866a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AngriRiku"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
