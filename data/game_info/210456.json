{"id": 210456, "slug": "winball-hd", "name": "WinBall (HD)", "name_original": "WinBall (HD)", "description": "<p>WinBall (HD) is a variant of the game Arkanoid with 50 increasingly complex levels and the usual combo bonuses. Unlike the classic Arkanoid this version features a \"magnet\" that affects the trajectory of the ball. Overall the game is very simple, with a screen full of shimmering and glittering objects which look nice but aren't meant to be a distraction. As in any game of this type, there is a table of records, different settings for sounds and graphics, and the option to continue the game after the loss of all lives (but with the loss of all points). </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e02a43a62bfed90db8036de320554c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zetus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
