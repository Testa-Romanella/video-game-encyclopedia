In the train-day, you can train your horse for improving its speed, stamina and power. In the race-day, your horse will run with rivals and win prize for you. The race's process will show as a text-base animation.</p>\n<p><strong>In this demo version,</strong>\u00a0the schedule is designed simply and there is no specific goal of the game. Just shows how the horse's abilities affect the race's process and result.<br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Use mouse click the green textbox which is means a button.\u00a0</p>\r\nGame logic details\u00a0\r\n<p>- target-speed &amp; current-speed &amp; acceleration: The target-speed determines by a function of\u00a0 the race-phase and horse status. When target-speed changes, the current-speed will tend to it with an determined acceleration.</p>\n<p>- stamina-point: The stamina-point determines by a function in the start of a race, and is consumed in the process. The consume rate is a function of the current-speed and horse status.</p>\n<p>- run-strategy: Give different coefficients to the target-speed function. For example, the FIRST has large bonus in the starting phases, while the tail has large bonus in the ending phases.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- sprint: In the sprint phase, the horse will try to use all its remaining stamina-point for a larger target-speed and a longer sprint phase length. It's a good chance for changing the situation.</p>\n<p>- Speed: Mainly affect the target-speed by giving coefficients to the function.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Stamina: Mainly affect the stamina-point by giving coefficients to the function.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Power: Mainly affect the acceleration by giving coefficients to the function.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>demo version tips</strong>: There may be something unbalanced with the functions and coefficients, which perhaps makes a run-strategy has too much bonus or a horse status looks\u00a0 useless.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T11:41:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d53/d53a4b6c1a27f178a9b3e2a634e0d826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hundun"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
