{"id": 4466, "slug": "catherine", "name": "Catherine", "name_original": "Catherine", "description": "<p>Catherine is a platformer/visual novel developed by Atlus for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot follows the adventures of Vincent Brooks, who is choosing between the two girlfriends \u2014 Katerine and Catherine with the opposite personalities. While making relationship choices throughout the daytime, Vinet is forced to participate in realistic nightmares at night. The setting of a title is two narratives folded one into another: on the outer layer, the game has TV-Show &quot;The Midnight Versus&quot; which tells the story of an inner layer \u2014 the adventures of &quot;Catherine&quot; world.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gaming process consists of two stages, according to the protagonist&#39;s activities. While the ventures during the day resemble the usual visual novel mechanics: walking, listening to dialogues and watching cinematics pieces, the action gameplay reveals itself in the night. There Vincent has to climb a set of stairs by removing and climbing blocks to avoid traps. If he fails \u2014 the protagonist dies in real life.</p>\n<h3>Reception</h3>\n<p>The game journalists generally liked the game but were disappointed by the sexists and misogynistic stories found within it. The title obtained commercial success, and thus there is a remaster coming out for PS4 and Vita. The remaster was half-ready in late 2017.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2011-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T16:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a91/a917f41bb87e4b9e7a762ac87d97a9dc.jpg", "website": "http://catherinethegame.com/home.html", "rating": 4.14, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 155, "owned": 2120, "beaten": 377, "toplay": 154, "dropped": 126, "playing": 34}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 144, "ratings_count": 483, "suggestions_count": 473, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 489, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Atlus", "Atlus Persona Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Capcom", "Deep Silver", "Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
