In Paralives, you are free to build homes, create characters and manage their lives inside their homes and all around an open world town. The game features innovative build tools that are easy to use but powerful for advanced builders. The simulation mode allows players to explore a city full of events, people to meet and ways to make their characters evolve and live an happy life (or not, if they choose to)!<br/><br/><br/>Building a dream house requires a lot of flexible tools. In Paralives, builders are not limited to a grid. Players can build walls of any length and at any angles. Your perfect house contains curved or slanted walls? Paralives has the tools for that. You want to recreate your real life home? Use the in-game measuring tape to recreate the exact dimensions! You can also fully customize object colors and texture as well as the size of windows and furniture. Just select an object, pull the corner anchors and make that window larger or upgrade that single bed to a king bed!<br/><br/>Creating the best life for your characters couldn\u2019t be possible without enjoying what the town has to offer beyond the walls of their houses. That\u2019s why Paralives let\u2019s you explore a cozy open world neighborhood filled with shops, parks, work places and other interesting spots to discover and meet people.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T02:36:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64a/64a39ca3b3be03ed98fa8dfe9d0df860.jpg", "website": "https://paralives.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 7, "toplay": 22, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Alex Mass\u00e9"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Alex Mass\u00e9"], "esrb_rating": null}
