{"id": 24742, "slug": "chase-hq", "name": "Chase H.Q.", "name_original": "Chase H.Q.", "description": "<p>\n      This is a different style of racing game, in which you attempt to catch \n      criminals by chasing them and ramming their car off the road. Playing as \n      two cops from the NYPD special \u201cCHASE H.Q.\u201d unit, the first half of each \n      stage involves you maneuvering your unmarked car in a heated chase, \n      followed by an action sequence in the latter half. Once you reach the \n      target vehicle, you flip on your lights and siren, then try to stop the \n      culprit by repeatedly colliding with them. Use your different gears \n      wisely as you make your way through streets and around corners, and be \n      careful not to hit objects or other cars, or you\u2019ll lose speed. Also at \n      your disposal are turbo units for temporary extra speed and ramming \n      power.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
