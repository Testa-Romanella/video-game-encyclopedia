During this time you can:</p>\n<p>Hand out flyers to other gig-goers using RMB!\r\nAvoid getting cornered by ticket touts - Slap them with LMB!  Mash LMB/RMB to escape if they get you!\r\nDon't accidentally slap the other gig-goers!</p>\n<p>In the second level you're in the gig and the band has started \r\nplaying.  Stand by an active speaker and use LMB to start filling up \r\nyour recording bar!</p>\n<p>This will alert the guards, make sure they don't spot you!  If you \r\nget seen by a guard your score will go down, and if they spot you \r\nrecording then that speaker will be deactivated!  If a guard gets near \r\nyou he will drain your recording bar!</p>\n<p>Once your recording bar is full you need to avoid the guard's attention for a little while longer, then make your escape!</p>\n<p>You lose if:  All the speakers get turned off, you run out of time, or the guards take all your recordings!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13b/13b4abb6ab08a7c00d49c24d4285d321.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jhearn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
