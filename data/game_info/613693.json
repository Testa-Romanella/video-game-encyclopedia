{"id": 613693, "slug": "cube-run-dashdev", "name": "Cube Run (DashDev)", "name_original": "Cube Run (DashDev)", "description": "<p><strong>Cube Run</strong> is a simple platformer\u00a0with a focus on hard, yet enjoyable levels and satisfying mechanics and movement. It's my first game since getting into the game development scene, so any feedback would be appreciated! You can send me feedback via the comment section on this project page, or you can contact me on <strong>Twitter</strong> or <strong>Discord</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I also streamed the development process of the game on <strong>Twitch</strong> and created devlogs each week over on my <strong>YouTube channel</strong>, which was a big meme. So if you're interested, go check them out!</p>\n\r\nWhat do I do?\r\n<p>Well, that's pretty simple. You are a cube and your ultimate goal is to navigate your way\u00a0to the yellow cube at the end of each level.</p>\n\r\nSo, that's it?\r\n<p>Besides the levels getting harder and harder, you will gain access to a total of three powerups throughout the game. Which you will have to use in combination to complete the later levels.</p>\n\r\nDouble Jump Ability\r\n\r\nDash Ability\r\n\r\nPlatform Switch Ability\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, I have cool abilities. What else is there?\r\n<p>Not only do you have to master each ability, but you'll have to master all the different types of platforms, mechanics and\u00a0objects that Cube Run has to offer! Here are a few quick sneak peeks.</p>\n\r\nWall Jumping\r\n\r\nSpeed Ground\r\n\r\nAnd many more!\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything else to Cube Run?\r\n<p>As much as it is a simple game, there <em>is</em><strong>\u00a0</strong>more to it than meets the eye. But you'll have to find out what those secrets are yourself.</p>\n\r\nCool! How do I get started?\r\n<p>You'll want to create a new folder somewhere on your computer and extract the contents of the zip into it. Most operating systems have a way to deal with zips, but if not, just download a zip decompressor of some sort and extract the file with that. Once you've got the folder ready, open it up and\u00a0click on the Cube Run executable file (application on Mac)\u00a0and have some fun!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're a Mac user, you may have to go into you security settings to allow the program through the MacOS security protocol. There should be a little question mark on the top right of the pop up that tells you how to do that. Once you've got the security settings open, make sure to click 'ok' on the pop-up so that the security settings will show the prompt to allow Cube\u00a0Run to run. Alternatively, you can download the itch.io desktop app and then download the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:07:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99b3a4aea145c6352f963acf6b5b5727.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dashdev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
