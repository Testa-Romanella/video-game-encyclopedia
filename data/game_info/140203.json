For us, this game has 3 aspects : 1) Break-In 2) Rescue 3) Escape</p><p>The game is fully ready to play with Gamepad and Joystick.</p><p>We decided to integrate all 3 of these in our game. Hence, evolved a storyline with 2 characters : Rob, an ex-CIA agent going to rescue his brother. We wanted the user to feel he was technically in a different an advance world. Hence, we put traps like flying drones with UV Light, proximity mines on ground, laser shields and AI-Security Guards. We have also put collectibles without collecting, you cannot advance to the next level.</p><p>We have a song picker also. (3 choices) in the pause menu using C# functions and some JS in Unity3D. All models were made in Autodesk Maya or Blender</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16a/16abf9d800217a804d23eec4c1d2dc4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dhruvtuli"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
