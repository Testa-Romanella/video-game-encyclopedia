Catch and shoot the bouncing ball to destroy your opponent's core while defending your own. Music by Juhani Junkala.<br/><br/>Nebulords Game Trailer<br/><br/>Controllers are highly recommended! Make sure to click in the game window first to focus the game and click on the fullscreen button in the bottom right corner.<br/><br/>There are optional keyboard/mouse controls for up to 3 players. Keyboard controls are quite difficult to use, but the mouse is on par with using a controller. Here are the optional controls:</p>\n<p>R - Reset level<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Change Level<br/></p>\n<p>Escape - Exit Fullscreen/Exit Game</p>\n<p><strong>Player 1:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>W - Boost/Start Game</p>\n<p>A - Rotate counter-clockwise</p>\n<p>D - Rotate clockwise</p>\n<p>Space - Join Game/Hold Ball/Shoot Ball<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Player 2:</strong></p>\n<p>Up Arrow\u00a0- Boost/Start Game</p>\n<p>Left Arrow - Rotate counter-clockwise\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Arrow - Rotate clockwise\r\n</p>\n<p>Control - Join Game/Hold Ball/Shoot Ball<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Player 4:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Left Click - Boost/Start Game</p>\n<p>Mouse Pointer - Aim</p>\n<p>Right Click - Join Game/Hold Ball/Shoot Ball<br/><br/>Game Jam Post Mortem:<br/></p>\n<p>This game was a ton of fun to make in the little spare time I had over the course of 30 days. With the exception of the music, I made everything from scratch and\u00a0I think what I was able to accomplish a decent level of\u00a0polish for a game jam game (though there are still a few bugs). However, it was not exactly smooth sailing. The goal of this game jam was to implement online multiplayer which I tried and failed miserably at. I'm\u00a0allergic to programming and I quickly found that online multiplayer was way over my head, so\u00a0I opted to make a an offline multiplayer game instead. I also had some additional\u00a0game mechanic ideas to keep in line with the \"Reconnect\" theme, but I didn't have time to implement them. As it stands, the game is inspired by 2 of my favorite childhood games which were Asteroids and Warlords, so in a sense, making this game helped me reconnect with my younger self (as cheesy as that sounds).\u00a0Many thanks to my awesome wife who helped me playtest and helped design the UI.<br/><br/>I would love to work on this game further and even aim towards a Steam release with AI and possibly online multiplayer.<br/><br/>\u00a0I welcome any feedback, and if you're a programmer who would like to collaborate and help me take the game to the next level, please hit me up!\u00a0<br/><br/>Enjoy the game! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T13:16:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b27bedc70b0f61bd671e9fe94e5109e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yajastudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
