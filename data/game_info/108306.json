But the only way to claim The Prize is to climb to the top of the festival and meet with the never-before-seen Monster Council\u2026 a tall order for a small monster. But, with friends like these, that shouldn't be a problem!</p>\n<p><strong>Buddy Up</strong> is a lighthearted 2D-platformer. It uses a unique interaction to play and explore the fair grounds. By holding hands with other monsters, Bud can form a chain of all his friends. Then, by stacking them on top of him they can, almost like a slinky, curl and climb over obstacles in their path. These published builds are a proof of concept demonstrating this core mechanic in both an introductory level and a sandbox space in which to play.<br/><br/>This game was made in a collaboration between \u00a0:</p>\n<p>Gloria Wan</p>\n<p>Lci Iarocci</p>\n<p>Yurie Murayama<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b57/b5719e1569fd201a09e28d45aca6364d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lci", "Glo", "yumu"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
