It travels ~4 times the length of the player when thrown up, down, left, right and if you throw in any diagonal it doesn't go quite as far so it ends up at a height you can jump on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also call the lasso back to you after you throw it out by hitting the same button, so in this way you can jump up, throw the lasso down then call it back to you after it travels a little and then get a big jump bounce out of it.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; Recommend Windows build for best experience (full screen and a more responsive rope\u2014I'm still figuring out HTML builds with GameMaker Studio)&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Recommend: Gamepad Controls </strong>(Xbox layout) // <em>Only able to test with an Xbox controller<br/></em><strong>D Pad</strong> | Movement<br/><strong>A</strong> | Jump<br/><strong>X</strong> | Throw Lasso (8 direction)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0<em>can bounce off of it twice until grounded again or hitting a swing<br/></em><strong>X Again </strong>| If the lasso is out you can recall it by hitting X again<br/><strong>B</strong> | Bullrush (dash)</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls</strong><br/><strong>WASD</strong> | Movement<br/><strong>I</strong> | Jump<br/><strong>J</strong> | Throw Lasso (8 direction) \u2014 c<em>an bounce off of it twice until grounded again or hitting a swing</em><br/><strong>J Again<em>\u00a0</em></strong><em>| If the lasso is out you can recall it by hitting J again</em><br/><strong>L</strong> | Bullrush<br/><em>In Case You Encounter Any Bugs:</em><br/><strong>R</strong> | Restart Room<br/><strong>Hold Shift and press R</strong> | Restart Game<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong>- All art, code and concept by MF of Endmark Games.<br/>- Thaleah Fat font used in game (from Tiny Worlds on itch.io).<br/>- Rewild 64 palette by Kelbster on Lospec.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks to my wife, AirBear, for supporting me during round one!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Huge thanks to\u00a0Xanderwood\u00a0for hosting.\u00a0</strong> Grateful\u00a0for the inspiration and education from folks like Shaun Spalding, Benjamin Anderson, Aaron Craig, Slynyrd, Pixel Pete, AdamCYounis, Vimlark, Jonas Tyroller, DevDuck, Brandon James Greer, and the YoYo Games Community.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:27:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c4/9c493ad32a2e9652b7a3c9382b9b39cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["EndmarkGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
