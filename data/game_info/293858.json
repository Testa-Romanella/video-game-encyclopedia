{"id": 293858, "slug": "myriads-renaissance", "name": "Myriads: Renaissance (itch)", "name_original": "Myriads: Renaissance (itch)", "description": "<p><strong><em>Myriads: Renaissance</em></strong> is a turn-based strategy game with city-building and tactical mechanics. Set in a low fantasy world made up of thousands of floating islands, build your kingdom the way you choose : conquer, trade or machinate.</p>\n\n\n<p>The game is still under development. The build available for download is a pre-alpha demo which only covers the city building and management part. You will be in charge of a capital-island. Manage its resources and population, and develop it by aggregating island's shards of various biomes and sizes.</p>\n<p>If you have any kind of critic, advice or if you find a bug, please post a comment.<strong> All feedback are welcome!<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Website: https://myriads-renaissance-game.com/</li><li>Twitter: https://twitter.com/MyriadsRGame/</li><li>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MyriadsRenaissanceGame/<br/></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<br/>\n<p>Extend your island and manage its resources using city building and light puzzle mechanics. Are your citizens starving? Add a wetland shard and build a farm. Do you need iron ingots to raise an army and no forest is neighbouring a mountain? Add a mountain next to a forest and build a furnace. But be careful, space is limited and your citizens can not build houses in mountains.</p>\n\n<p>You can not survive on your own, you will need to explore your surroundings. Travel into a procedurally generated world, discovering a myriad of floating islands and factions, in a turn-based strategy game. Send your armies to explore ruins looking for lost secrets. Find new trading partners and establish trading post on their island. But be careful, the more you explore, the more you will let potential enemies know that you exist.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Islands are limited in size, you will need to expand your territory outside of your capital\u2019s bound. Do you need some wood for a new trade or to simply sustain your capital\u2019s needs? Send your colon establish a new colony. Do you need more prestige for more troops to follow you? Oblige your new ally to become a vassal and benefit from their renown. But with great power comes great responsibility: will you be able to defend them?</p>\n<br/>\n<p>There are many ways to claim what should be yours. Will you scheme and make this faction one of your vassal? Will you conquer them? Choose your tactical challenge style to achieve your goal, resolving turn-based conflict using trader, diplomat or soldier units. Use your island and the other factions\u2019 one as a battlefield. Shape of the island, location of buildings and bridges will affect your strategy and units deployment.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>New technologies are the key to overcome your rivals. Are your citizens struggling with the lack of space? Use the lost secrets your armies found and unlock a new research which allows more shards to be gathered. Do you wish to unlock a whole new branch dedicated to ships logistics? Build a new library and let your cartographers tell your armies where to look for.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:44:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e77d77970de4e9e6fe927b85a2d79552.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 395, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sleeping Eight Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
