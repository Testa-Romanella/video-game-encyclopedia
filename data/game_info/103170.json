The game doesn't come with sound effects, so you'll have to supply your own.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>This game was created for a game jam.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Getting Started</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Set clutch to ON.</li>\n<li>Rev up engine to 2000+ RPM.</li>\n<li>Shift up to 1st gear.</li>\n<li>Set clutch to OFF.</li>\n<li>Hit the gas hard!</li>\n<li>Shift up/down accordingly.</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>Quick Guide</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>You must have 2000+ RPM when shifting gears.</li>\n<li>When shifting gears and accelerating, you will lose RPM.
