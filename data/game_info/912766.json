The total taking was 200 Million dollars in Crypto. However every crooked Internet City Police officer knows it was Keemstar's gang that did it. Now he has hired hitmen Kenneth and Janie to take car of loose ends. However when a hacking job that Kenneth and Janie do goes south they near the gangs of Internet City into a all out war.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Development Story</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game never got to the development stage but this was cancelled DLC for the first Internet City game. It stayed in the writers stage for over 1 month before eventually being cancelled due to lack of motivation. The writer I partnered with named Janie Balderas finished it, however I never got around to developing it. Instead me and Janie worked on the story to a new IP called Chronicles of Burnet, however that project was also canned. I revived this project on 11/27/2022 for Newground's 3 Star Game Jam.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>How to save and keep the save file on Mobile:\r\n</p>\n<p>To save on Mobile devices download a 3rd party browser\u00a0Chrome, Opera, Brave etc\u00a0on your phone and play the game that way\u00a0for some reason\u00a0the default browser provided on your phone Safari/Google only save the game for a limited time but through Chrome the save is there in definite Note this has been tested on Private browsers Brave/Opera and works the same way\u00a0More information about the game\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Controls\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>PC:\r\n</p>\n<p>Movement: Arrow keys, Num pad\r\n</p>\n<p>Action: Z, Enter, Space or walk up to it\r\n</p>\n<p>Cancel: X, Esc, Num pad 0\r\n</p>\n<p>Menu: X, Esc, Num pad 0\r\n</p>\n<p>Dash: Shift\r\n</p>\n<p>Previous Page: Q, Page Up\r\n</p>\n<p>Next Page: W, Page Down\r\n</p>\n<p>Scroll Pages: Arrow Keys, Num pad\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Xbox Controller:\r\n</p>\n<p>Movement: D-Pad\r\n</p>\n<p>Action: A\r\n</p>\n<p>Cancel: B\r\n</p>\n<p>Menu: Y\r\n</p>\n<p>Dash: X\r\n</p>\n<p>Previous Page: LB\r\n</p>\n<p>Next Page: RB\r\n</p>\n<p>Scroll Pages: D-Pad\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Playstation Controller:\r\n</p>\n<p>Movement: D-Pad\r\n</p>\n<p>Action: X button\r\n</p>\n<p>Cancel: Circle\r\n</p>\n<p>Menu: Triangle\r\n</p>\n<p>Dash: Square\r\n</p>\n<p>Previous Page: L1\r\n</p>\n<p>Next Page: R1\r\n</p>\n<p>Scroll Pages: D-Pad\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Mobile Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>Movement: Tap destination *2\r\n</p>\n<p>Action: Tap target\r\n</p>\n<p>Cancel: Tap with two fingers\r\n</p>\n<p>Menu: Tap with two fingers\r\n</p>\n<p>Dash: None\r\n</p>\n<p>Previous Page: None\r\n</p>\n<p>Next Page: None\r\n</p>\n<p>Scroll Pages: Tap and hold as you swipe from inside of page to outside of page.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Mouse:\r\n</p>\n<p>Movement: Click destination *2\r\n</p>\n<p>Action: Click Target\r\n</p>\n<p>Cancel: Right Click\r\n</p>\n<p>Menu: Right Click\r\n</p>\n<p>Dash: None\r\n</p>\n<p>Previous Page: None\r\n</p>\n<p>Next Page: None\r\n</p>\n<p>Scroll Pages: Drag from inside of page to outside of page/mouse scroll wheel\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs and Fixes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Text load Bug: If the text in the game does not load then refresh the page and load from a auto save file.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:48:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/950/950f0f3a353904527a5164d2b174a874.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["makostacks Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
