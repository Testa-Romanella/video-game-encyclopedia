It's only one level and can be played up to two players. They play as either a blue or red rabbit and must race to the end of the obstacle course while avoiding traps, collecting coins, and bouncing balls used to make it a bit challenging and fun. Whoever gets to the end of the obstacle course and collects the key, will win!\u00a0Interested? Or just want to have a game to compete with each other? Then download now!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T02:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef6/ef6c9f9c7eb5ee7c3e81db3275ff26be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hugo Lopez"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
