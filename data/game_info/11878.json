This game contains three play styles based on different types of locomotion: a \"rails shooter\" mode, an experimental \"jog-to-move\" mode in which the player jogs in place to move forward along the path, and a highly experimental Treadmill Mode that lets brave VR users play the game while walking on an exercise treadmill.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Tackle missions or play in \"Endless\" mode to survive as long as you can.</li></ul><ul><li>Certain elements of the missions are procedurally generated. Some things will be different each time you play.</li></ul><ul><li>The missions follow a common pattern, but they differ according to which two weapons you get as well as other things. In the intro mission, you get a shield and plasma crossbow. In Mission 1, you get a pistol and a basic sword/machete. In Mission 2, you get a pistol and a sword with a \"force field.\" In Mission 3, you dual-wield pistols. Mission 4 gives you a \"TimeSaber\" that allows you to slow enemy fire mid-air. Mission 5 lets you deflect enemy fire with a plasma sword, and Mission 6 gives you \"MagneGuns\" that can \"magnetically\" pull in robots and launch them.</li></ul><br/>GAMEPLAY HINTS:<br/><ul><li>Shoot the red crystals to deactivate doorway lasers.</li></ul><ul><li>The \"basic blade\" you have in Mission 1 is a simple weapon... but in later missions you have more advanced technologies.</li></ul><ul><li>When you come to the crystal \"reactor core\" at the end of each mission, destroy the rotating crystals first otherwise the center crystal will regenerate.</li></ul><ul><li>If you lose a mission a certain number of times on \"Less Difficult Mode,\" it will unlock an even easier difficulty level that you can choose: \"Least Difficult Mode.\" </li></ul><ul><li>If you're a scoundrel, you can go into \"Game Options,\" and then \"Cheating Options\" to unlock the missions without beating the preceding ones.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7a888e998d92ead4e9f34ca5bf0755e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 494, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RealityRig"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["RealityRig"], "esrb_rating": null}
