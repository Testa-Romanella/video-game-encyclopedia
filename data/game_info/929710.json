It was a fun and challenging process, which we learned a lot about doing it and we hope you can have a short and nice experience of the game!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Wilson Xavier</p>\n<p>Andrey Ribeiro</p>\n<p>Guilherme</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T12:16:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e7/2e7776c3fb135e62059305cc491cb1ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dellaian"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
