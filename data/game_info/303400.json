But instead of using digit, it is a pattern-type password. After each wrong pattern you draw, it will be recorded in the history. The history will show you not only the pattern you have drawn but also how many correct node and how many correct line. Beware, only the latest 3 history will be saved. Crack the pattern within the time limit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:27:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97f/97f083a2f0005353c58b1e6edcd7ede5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Azure Guild"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
