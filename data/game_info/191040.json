Breathe in when close to the ground to jump up and breathe out to blow yourself forward. Score is determined by horizontal distance and maximum air time.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the first Game Maker's Toolkit game jam.</p>\n<p><strong>How does your submission match the theme?</strong></p>\n<p>There is basically only one mechanic in the game: breathing. All movement happens by breathing in and out. By breathing in, the player expands and jumps in the air. By breathing out, the player can control its rotation and velocity. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Breathe in: \u2191</li><li>Breathe out: \u2193</li><li>Breathe up: \u2192</li><li>Breathe down: \u2190</li><li>Reset: R</li><li>Toggle Mute: M (Game starts muted)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Engine</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Engine used is MonoGame</li><li>For physics we used Farseer Physics</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sound effects made with BFXR</li><li>Song is \"Casual Loop #1\" from Freesound.org by ispeakwaves (license)</li><li>Font is m5x7 by Daniel Linssen AKA ManaGore</li><li>Artwork is home drawn :)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Contributors<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Design and programming by Jjagg and Jeffersyno</li><li>Beautiful artwork by Jeffersyno</li></ul>\n<p>The game is open sourced on GitHub: https://github.com/Jjagg/gmtk-jam2017</p>\n<p><em>Note: Mac is untested but should work technically, so I decided to upload it anyway.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f15/f155eda4001b4a630146a64228e7f01c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jjagg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
