Play as either Justice or Chaos with a friend and see who wins!</p>\n\n<p>Developer note:</p>\n<p>This game has been a tricky one. After doing a game jam last week and feeling a little burnt out, I have tried to do my best in uploading this before the deadline. What I have learned from this is that I should probably take a break from game jams and try to make a longer term project that is of better quality. That way I can create something a lot more fun next time.</p>\n<p>Also this game is a little broken. When teleporting to a random room/maze you may be taken back to the title screen, but luckily your score will be kept (hopefully).\u00a0</p>\n<p>5 colours used: black, white, grey, purple and yellow.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\n<p>-Caleb (LebbyFoxx)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T05:03:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f54fceb153073be30e8f7760b73f281e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
