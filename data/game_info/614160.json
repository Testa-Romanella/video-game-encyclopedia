The opponent AI features dynamic pathfinding and obstacle avoidance!</p>\n<p>The driving model is semi realistic, requiring a bit of\u00a0skill and practice to master. The game also features both automatic and manual gearbox transmission.<br/></p>\n<p>Future of the project: The final vision is a game that lives and breathes mountain racing culture, with classic JDM inspired cars, tuning and customization, and a campaign that takes you from track to track to beat the local crews, with exciting uphill and downhill duels and other racing challenges.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Updates:</p><p>06/06/2021; 16:00 -\u00a0</p><p>&gt;Fixed the positioning of some text in the Main Menu</p><p>&gt;The impact magnitude that causes the player to fail the Duel gamemode is now slightly more forgiving</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:02:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/811/811df3b4d06bbe1a5225a272949284f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IBU400g"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
