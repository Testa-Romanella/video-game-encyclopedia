After about a year or two of effort I have composed a Resident Evil meets Dragon Age (or at least I tried) RPG that is set on the arctic region of Mars.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is part 1 of hopefully a 5 part series starring 5 different characters per game. The object of the game is to find your way to the surface and find your crew. But doing that won't be easy despite the recent discovery on Mars that answers the question, \"are we alone?\"<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are DR. Steo Valic, a researcher that managed to escape a massive alien attack from a unknown group of species living underneath the Mars surface. With only 2 months on the red planet under humanities belt, it would be immediately challenged by entities from another time than us. Can you survive the depth of what once was considered home?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Have fun and if you enjoy what you have played, consider supporting me on patreon or even on here with a quick donation. The more I can invest in this project, the more quality I can bring to the final build.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The DEMO is free of course and please leave feedback! If you know anyone that digs these type of games share it with them!
