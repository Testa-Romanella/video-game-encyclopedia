Now! </p><p>Try to understand robot anatomy, find the missing part, place it on the robot correctly. Don't forget about the time. </p><p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p><p>- Try to understand which part robot misses.</p><p>- Look for missing part in right and left force fields. </p><p>- Rotate part in correct position by clicking on it (left click).</p><p>- Set up the part on robot (right click).</p><p>- Get your scores and unlock more robots.</p><p>This game represents a simple idea I had in my head some time ago. Now it came to reality, but I desperately need feedback from itch.io community. </p><p><strong>What I want to know:</strong></p><p>- is it interesting and feels like an holistic game for you?</p><p>- are you ok with having time pressure?</p><p>- What to improve? Does this game lacks something you would like to add? Suggest your ideas please.</p><p>The game initially was designed for touch devices, and we already launched it on iOS. But AppStore is not friendly for new developers, and we got no feedback at all. I count on you!</p><p>We will port Robotap to Android straight after improving the game regarding to community feedback. Windows phone is also an option.</p><p>PS: We are also developing Skedaddle, which has been greenlit on Steam. This game will be here too, as soon as we will be ready to distribute the playable game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d72/d72f6d8261533e730033bc336a13f82e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["pan1cmode"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
