My teacher recommended I use itch.io to receive feedback on my game, and so here I am.</p>\n<p>The game I'm making is very simple; it's a variation of pong using characters as either paddle, who possess unique abilities that can help them in beating the other. This project wants to focus on making pong look cooler to play, as well as build on the basic game.</p>\n<p>Right now this game is in a prototype stage and has very few visual elements. One player plays\u00a0using the W, S and A keys, and the other player by using the Arrow keys.</p>\n<p>The game requires 2 players to play, using one keyboard, so grab a friend and battle it out! Don't have a friend? Don't worry, neither does GammaP, the sentient AI who needs an opponent in the VS GammaP mode!</p>\n<p>Afterwards, please consider answering this survey, it would help a ton!</p>\n<p>https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/MCJCZD7</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for visiting this page! -A</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/751/75132d3e42de7ac91ad4d243430abdce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Aravash"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
