Players are required to communicate clearly and avoid making assumptions under time constraints. Since players are unaware of which puzzles they will encounter and how to read the complex yet ambiguous manual, the game makes for an exciting and challenging way of improving social bonds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our video game was inspired by the story of King Arthur. Merlin has instructions while Arthur has the puzzles to unlock the Excalibur and draw out invading Saxton forces. This will be no easy challenge though as the puzzles Arthur solves become progressively more difficult as the number of options and combinations increase. Since two-player time-constrained games have traditionally been about bomb diffusing, we want to almost flip the script and come up with our own theme that can improve the immersion in the game/character.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T15:59:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fed/fed8ba4f6997d13fb7d05260412911c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jack.yoon04"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
