{"id": 521375, "slug": "lost-in-darkness-affax", "name": "Lost in Darkness (Affax)", "name_original": "Lost in Darkness (Affax)", "description": "\"You have 2 friends, your flashlight and your trusty shotgun\"\r\n<p>You and your \"friends\" got into the survival bunker just in time! The world has ended and you find out you don't have enough rations to survive with everyone... In fact, there are enough rations for only ONE person.\u00a0Your friends have turned against you and now try to kill you, so kill them before they kill you!</p>\nHeads up: I made the game in 2-3 weeks, so there might be some bugs :)\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You randomly spawn into the bunker, and need to pickup weapons to kill your untrusty comrades. Rounds are pretty quick, and there is a gas zone that forces you into the middle.</p>\n<p>You can only see around a meter forward, and with the flashlight more.\u00a0<strong>BUT BEWARE,</strong>\u00a0other people can see your flashlight. This will make it considerably easier to kill you, as they can see you but you can't see them.</p>\n\r\nMultiplayer\r\n<p>The multiplayer doesn't require port forwarding, but uses my relay server. You still host it on your computer, but the messages go through my server. It ensures that your ip will not be broadcasted norsent to the other players, giving you peace of mind.</p>\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>I made the game in around 3 weeks, so don't expect much :P The game was first planned for halloween (but I wasn't even fast enough). I hope you can still enjoy it.</p>\n\r\nThe settings are found in the pause menu &amp; main menu\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Move: WASD</li><li>Reload: R</li><li>Shoot: L CLICK</li><li>Sprint: Shift</li><li>Slow-walk: CTRL</li><li>Pause: Esc</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>SFX: Kenney &amp; CohexBruh</li><li>Models: Quaternius</li><li>BG Song: ThrillShowX</li><li>Ui Shapes Kit: ThisOtherThing</li><li>Everything Else: Me</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T06:35:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e1/3e1737659fcc1d91aeb8a1c8e7981580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Affax"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
