Maybe this is some of it.\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\tThree minutes of shooting-star bullet hell. Catch as many as you can and survive until dawn. Fill lots of jars and nab colored stars for bonus points, but don't get smashed.\r\n\t</li><li>\r\n\tHigher scores = better endings. Four possible variations.</li><li>Three difficulty levels = three different kinds of wrist injury.</li><li>Hand-drawn low-res low-color pixel art. Maximum potential for misinterpretation.</li><li>\r\n\tPlays best loud in a dark room. </li></ul>\n<p>This is version 1.0.3, and (hopefully) represents a complete experience. Thinking about a scoreboard later if folks are interested.<br/></p>\n<p>Features strobe effects that might be visually disturbing. They can be turned off in the options menu.</p>\n<p>Requires a mouse and keyboard to play. Currently Windows only. OSX and Linux soon.<br/></p>\n<p>Please view the README for full audio credits and a more extensive explanation of gameplay options.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tthanks!<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cd/1cd37c1ca6c40fc1aadd01820421152c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["-hexcavator-"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
