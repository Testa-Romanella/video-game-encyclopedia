Be warned, however, that this prisoner has a chip embedded in his systems that takes control over his body when his stress levels (healthbar) reach a maximum. You will have to leave barbed wire in his path to his cell, if the chip does take over, which will slow him down as the countdown for him to get to his cell runs off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*CONTROLS*</p>\n<p>-Move: W,S.</p>\n<p>-Turn: A,D or Left Click Pressed for Free Look.</p>\n<p>-Strafe: Q,E.</p>\n<p>-Telekinetic Grab: Space.</p>\n<p>*Borrowed the YoYoGames explosive barrel due to time restrains.</p>\n<p>*Special Thanks to Bibi for the Cover.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc2/bc2cc37d0f57e6108ba5d09f79bdb098.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["All the Might"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
