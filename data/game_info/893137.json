I have been friends with your father Markus Williams for many years, and I too was distraught to hear, that his ship had disappeared.</p>\n<p>I was allthemore surprised when a member of the crew of the HMS Explorer showed up in London a few weeks ago, crazy out of his mind and unresponsive.</p>\n<p>However, over the last few years I have developed a machine which could help us unlock the secrets of what happened to that ship. If you are interested contact me\u00a0 at your earliest convenience.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Albert Canmarrow</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Move<br/>Mouse - Look Around<br/>E - Interact<br/></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game was made during the HonestJam V.
