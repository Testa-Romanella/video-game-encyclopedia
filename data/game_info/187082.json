Whilst in a normal household this might not be a dramatic issue, this game takes place in a house run by an (probably) evil robotic nanny.</p>\n<p>The robot will send you to sleep if it sees you must sneak between power outlets avoiding being sent to an early bed.<br/>BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!!</p>\n<p>Whilst avoiding your (probably) evil nanny, you must not lose your score on your portable system. You can play the game in your peripheral vision but if you press the F key you can view it in it's full scale. The latter option will leave you more vulnerable to being spotted by Nanni though so be careful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ee/5eea6260aa04bd4e0094585625122134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kristiandixon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
