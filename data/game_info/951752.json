You're stuck inside a claustrophobic, abandoned factory, trying to find some way to protect yourself from the corruption outside...or perhaps, you can find a way to control it?</p>\n<p>This is sort of a \"return to form\" being like a sector in Shifter Labs, with a self-contained open environment to explore. It has 8 transformations and a normal and secret \"true\" ending.</p>\n<p>---------\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Deep beneath the soil of the expanse known as the Outlands, a twisting library coils in its depths. Wrapping around in impossible hallways that expand in all directions, forever holding a full, unlimited catalogue of knowledge from every corner of the multiverse. Detailed descriptions of every birth, event, death, and tragedy of every reality.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Reality graces humans with little, and yet, in a hushed dark corner of the library, along with the hand of The Librarian, there are stories of humans who have survived unknowable corruption.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>These are their stories.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Archive of Corruption is a series of short, experimental games that feature a small, easy-to-swallow story, featuring things to transform into and endings to find in each. You can expect these games to release very often. I aim to publish these games once a week\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T23:33:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/689287436a925c607d441c53d35a890e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChaosTheSalamander"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
