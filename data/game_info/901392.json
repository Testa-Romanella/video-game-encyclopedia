You play as Goober, a mutant jelly jam fighting against dolphins who want to be the first person to kill Goober. This is the gift for gallonofouncs for the Secret Santa jam. This wasn't so polished since I was doing almost the whole game and since there was still school while the game was being developed.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Z to shoot,\u00a0X to switch weapon and\u00a0arrow keys to move. Press Z to continue in the title, comic and ending screen.\u00a0Avoid bullets as they will make Goober grow bigger and if if Goober grows bigger, it will be so big it'll see space then it will explode and you lose. Also if you want to get technical, the hitbox of Goober is at it's leg so Goober can safely touch dangerous objects in other parts of itself.\u00a0You can pick up to 2\u00a0 food\u00a0weapons (they shoot out food so the dolphin can be satisfied and therefore they explode)\u00a0in the beginning with a choice of 4\u00a0food weapons to pick from.</p>\n<p>Food Weapon 1: Fires goob food straightforward quickly.</p>\n<p>Food Weapon 2: Fires goob food around Goober which disappear after a while. Also firing bullets 30 times will result in Goober shrinking.</p>\n<p>Food Weapon 3: Leaves a trail of goob food that disappear after a while. Also, when equipping the weapon, getting hit will make Goober grow twice in size.</p>\n<p>Food Weapon 4: Fires goob food\u00a0aiming randomly. Also, the bullet's damage output depends on the size of Goober. The bigger Goober is, the bigger the damage output is.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Takago - Programmer, Lead Game Designer, Vector Artist, Pixel Artist and SFX Artist</p>\n<p>Miyaki - Main Pixel Artist</p>\n<p>sproutser.art\u00a0- Vector Artist (Title Screen Specifically)</p>\n<p>Trevor Lentz - Music Composer for Do Not Run<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T13:25:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fa/2fa2d85c69ed3fc4f3eb7dc5df76206a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
