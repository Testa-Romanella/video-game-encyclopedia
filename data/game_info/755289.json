{"id": 755289, "slug": "asteroid-space-shooter", "name": "Asteroid Space Shooter", "name_original": "Asteroid Space Shooter", "description": "<p>Jump in to a surprisingly tactical experience, where careful planning is rewarded.</p>\n<p>This is a 48-hour* jam project\u00a0where we had to combine two usually mismatching game categories. We chose Bullet Hell and Turn-Based.<br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay loop consists of two players taking turns and\u00a0having two actions: one move, and one attack action. These actions can be done in any order and either one, or both of them can be skipped if the player so chooses. After ending turn, every asteroid in the field moves to its indicated direction, possibly colliding with something or leaving the battlefield. After this movement, a random amount of new asteroids are spawned to the edges of the battlefield and\u00a0the next player starts their turn. If a player shoots an asteroid or an asteroid collides with something, it explodes in its indicated pattern. If an explosion finds a target, an asteroid explodes and a player takes\u00a03 damage that increases by 1 for every other asteroid that has caused the said chain reaction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For example: an asteroid explodes (3). That explosion triggers another asteroid (4) and that triggers another one (5). If this third asteroid's explosion then hits a player, they take 5 damage. (Both players have 10 health.)</p>\n\n<p>-- CREDITS --</p>\n<p>Programming: J4m35</p>\n<p>Art: Firri April</p>\n<p>Design: J4m35, Firri April</p>\n<p>Music: Box Cat Games</p>\n\n<p>-- HELP --</p>\n<p>Actions: The player can toggle between actions with keys 1 (Move action) and 2 (Attack action)</p>\n<p>- Move action: Clicking on a highlighted adjacent hex to the player's ship moves the player there.</p>\n<p>- Attack action: Clicking on a highlighted line, the player's ship fires a small laser.
