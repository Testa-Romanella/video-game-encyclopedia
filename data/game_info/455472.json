Unfortunately, for this initial game jam build,\u00a0I was unable to put all of them in; however, you can see everyone's submissions in the credits.</p>\n<p>This game is still under development, as I continue to add more and fully implement everyone's drawings.</p>\n<p>The game is played with the WASD/Arrow keys and the mouse.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing.<br/></p>\n<p>Follow me on:<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.kiptoke.com/</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/KiptokeDev<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Audio in Game:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Various sound effects from Leshy SFMaker</p>\n<p>The Ice Giants by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5745-the-ice-giants<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T05:28:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41c/41c398ae285b85e5011850d30e4d8605.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kiptoke"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
