Using one of the game's two endings as a starting point, it is a very personal and exploratory narrative about these two women, having reconnected through such traumatizing events, learning how to lean into each-other to support one another in a relationship, building romance on top of their long-lasting friendship while trying to find ways to cope and heal through everything they've endured. Eventually bringing Stella, Brooke, and Victoria in as supporting characters, <em>All Wounds </em>eventually explores a theoretical future with Max and Chloe confronting and accepting things about their decisions they regret. (yes, a happy ending, but not a fluffy one)<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<strong><em>\u201cThis is where we get into trouble. You're meant to know only as much as you can handle. When you wander outside of your realm is when we end up fighting.\u201d<br/><br/></em></strong>\n<p>The story goes to some dark places, as a head's up (honestly, I think I should probably tone down Chapter 1 a bit in this regard, it's almost a bit too much reiterating trauma all at once? Though the idea was to make the reader feel as overwhelmed and tired as Max does directly after such a week). But the end-goal here is to put these characters through the exhausting paces of coping with depression, survivor's guilt, regret, PTSD, loss...but ultimately, healing. And to be clear, this is definitely a story interpreting Max and Chloe as a romantic couple, they WILL be dating not far into the story, and a lot of the early-game conflict comes from the complications of accepting those feelings and pursuing them in the face of the week they have endured and the choices they have made. And it does have a happy ending that they earn together (with some help!).<br/></p>\n\n\n<strong><em>\u201cEl. Psy. Kongroo.\"<br/><br/><br/></em></strong>\n<p>As a visual novel, the story will swap perspectives between Max and Chloe each chapter, with the narration shifting styles as well as allowing choices to be made from both characters' points of view. While the main plot has a fixed purpose and direction, the ultimate climax resolution of the story is planned to have a few different ways of coming together, and at the very least I want to provide not just alternate dialogue but instances of completely different scenes depending on certain choices or combinations of choices.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<em><strong>\u201cWhoa, when did you evolve your Nidorina?\u201d <br/>\u201cWhen you weren\u2019t lookin\u2019.

In prose format, the 20 chapter narrative is complete, and can be read on AO3 and FF.net. With the visual novel's draft text finally written out, I have been adapting it all to renpy, and am gradually working my way through and coding in choices, alternate dialogue/scenes, etc. So it will ultimately end up having noticeably more content than even the fic, if I can pull this whole thing off properly.<br/><br/>A gallery featuring artwork made for this visual novel can be seen here.</p>\n\n<p>Any donations made will be put back into commissioning artwork for this project (primarily, character sprites). You can donate directly through PayPal if you wish. There's also Ko-Fi. Alternately, I have a joint Patreon with my fiance, mollifiable, for our writing/art/video content, though eventually I plan to post updated builds for this project there. <br/></p>\n<p>You can follow updates for this project over here.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time!
