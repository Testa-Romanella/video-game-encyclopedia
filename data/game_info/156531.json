You control a super cute germ covered by colorful jelly (yes, we're sure it's for bad guys, don't be distracted by cuteness ). It's a super resistent germ which has to survive inside a human body. Of course it would try to kill you (you're an evil germ, don't forget it), but you have 4 colorful and powerful skills:</p>\n<ul><li>Green: Throw a sticky jelly to the walls arround you. Then, press left or rigth arrow to stick yourself to the wall.</li><li>Blue: Throw a projectile to kill enemies.</li><li>Purple: Make a quick dash forward.</li><li>Yellow: Throw yellow jelly on the ground to jump higher.</li></ul>\n<p>You would have to figth some body soldiers too. Don't forget you're inside a human body and he doesn't like you. You would be able to figth the cute colorful lymphocytes attacking them but if you're wise, you will learn to disguise yourself to pass unnoticed without wasting jelly.</p>\n<p>Remember: <em>Jelly is Life</em>.
