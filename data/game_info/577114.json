The objective of the game is to navigate underwater in a submarine to collect treasure, but oxygen supply is limited so players must stay alert! As the player descends further into the water, the environment becomes darker and the submarine light must be utilized to find treasure. This game was created in 48 hours, and I was the lead designer and environment artist. As the designer, I created the game's concept and designed player constraints and level design.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Abby Pearson\r\n</p>\n<p>Nicole Stocks\r\n</p>\n<p>Ryan Chang\r\n</p>\n<p>Walker McDonald\r\n</p>\n<p>William Lacey\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:46:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/033/0336efd5d399d8ddfa2dfc04b5c38cf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nichi13"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
