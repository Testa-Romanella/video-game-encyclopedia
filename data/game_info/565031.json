It's not much: just the said person's home when they were alive, a ton of globes that are their memories, and some juice harvesting equipment.</p>\n<p>If a person wants their spirit to stick around, they need to work hard at harvesting juice from the globes, which is turned into ectoplasm and helps keep their spirit existing in nonexistence. They have to care for their memories, relive them, and get the most out of them that they can in this bleak, retrospective afterlife.</p>\n<p>Made for Dr. Bradbury's New Media 231 Introductory Interactive Media class<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:17:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b6/2b647ced19beaf3f3bb5ede57d87607a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["max levine stuff"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
