His paintings were little more than a name and a picture of an arcade cabinet, but they were unique and odd and packed full of nostalgia. I decided to bring a few of the paintings to life by jamming out little games based on his concepts. Square Peg, Round Hole was the second game that I did in this series. I imagined it as a quick-twitch shape matching game. I originally built Square Peg, Round Hole over the course of a weekend at the end of March, 2014 using Unity 5. As a development exercise, I decided to recreate Square Peg, Round Hole using a modern version of Unity.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY<br/></strong>Square Peg, Round Hole is a simple shape matching micro-game. Switch between a square, circle, or triangle to match the theme of the scrolling shape fields that move increasingly faster as the game progresses.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong>space/tap/click: START game, CHANGE shape while playing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T17:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4c/d4c2d98cfc117df4e160dabd817f4162.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheRealMattKain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
