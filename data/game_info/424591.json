And he's gonna do it--</p>\n<p>Small game that I made to settle some concepts with the Godot engine. This is my first game that I publish.<br/>Although my craft is the music composition, I always wanted to learn how to make video games. Since I am not a programmer, Godot gave me the opportunity to learn some programming concepts and structure closer to my way of thinking. Maybe the code is not the most elegant thing I can do well, but the game is done.<br/>After trial and error on various projects, I decided to make a publishable game, and here it is. Made in 2 weeks, dedicating a minimum of 1 hour per day.<br/>Enjoy it!</p>\n\n\n<p>Game and music made by Ricardo Cuello</p>\n<p>This work is licensed under a\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.<br/></p>\n<p>Graphic Assets by Kenney</p>\n<br/>\n<p>If you liked the game you consider following me on social networks to find out about the next releases!</p>\n<ul><li>My Bandcamp:\u00a0https://rest--vgmusic.bandcamp.com/follow_me</li><li>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/PkRichar</li><li>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgpy9Nz1AczqTxoCR5RJA1A</li><li>Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/richar_rest/</li><li>Soundcloud:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/rest-vgmusic</li></ul>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T04:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67f/67fa0f34448de01516ab1294d93448a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
