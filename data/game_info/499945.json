Made for the Magical Girl Jam #2.</p>\n<p>There is no sound<br/></p>\n<p>PC build included and runs better than webgl.<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to pacman in that you must run away from enemies until you are able to turn the tides. Collect the stars to give your shark mascot the ability to dash/jump and kill enemies with it to gather magic. Once enough magic is gathered (5 enemies worth) you'll transform automatically. Once transformed you'll gain a speed boost and the ability to kill enemies on touch and see the hidden tendrils (currently purple spheres). The game is over once all the tendrils are purified.<br/></p>\n<p>Dying will subtract 30 seconds from the timer. Game is over if time reaches zero.</p><p>Score is based off time left and kills.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move / UI move</li><li>Left Shift - Dash/Jump (dash against a 1-2 thick wall to jump over)<ul><li>Dashes do AOE explosion at start and end and beat enemies</li></ul></li><li>ESC - Pause Menu</li><li>Space - Select in menus</li></ul>\n<p>WebGL issues:</p>\n<ul><li>The webgl runs a bit slower for me and I'm not sure why.</li><li>The dangerzones for enemy artillery jitters.</li><li>Hitstops when killing enemies is longer for some reason.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:02:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c0/7c0e1464480e80cea3b30e1522d8eaa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AJuneBug"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
