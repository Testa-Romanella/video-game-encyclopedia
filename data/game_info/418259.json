The prompt was simply to create an arcade game. That is to say one that can be played on an arcade cabinet and that\u00a0resonates with the classic arcade games of the 1970's and 80's.</p>\n<p>It is a\u00a02 player competitive game where each player takes control of spaceships locked in combat over their solar system! The battle takes place along the systems rings and the first player to destroy the other 15 times is the victor! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:11:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/651/6513be48148d24ad4306cb0b9dee2634.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aether", "Kai", "KilianJohnson", "AllenAvey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
