Exploratory and interpretive, the project emphasizes experimental gameplay while exploring alternative methods of storytelling through immersive virtual worlds connected as a series of audio-visual experiences. Aphetan Tellurian represents the convergence of three notable interests: a landmark show in the ever-growing history of human artifacts, digital rendering and interpretations of actuality, and the fascination with the ubiquitous integration of technology and real life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T19:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8dad0809fed661abe1deec586faf07c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 375, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michelle.L."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
