Anonymous' Adventure", "description": "<p>After being cast away at sea for what seemed like an eternity, the boy name Alzheimer came upon an island in the middle of the vast waters. This island looked normal, beautiful in fact. But something in the air felt strange as he stepped onto the beach and walked towards the trees. Soon there would be a constant fight for his life as he takes down countless enemies during the daytime while preparing for the night! For when the night falls the island itself disappears, a new challenge emerges...or rather rises, from the depths. With new challenges, and a different struggle to survive the night until the water dissipates as the sun rises and the seas recede.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T16:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a8415199929baf9df9641ad4b58c9b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunset Sword Saint"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
