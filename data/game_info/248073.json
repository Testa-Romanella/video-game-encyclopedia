However little did they know, that adding an essence of hunger for organs would be the alchemist\u2019s downfall. By the time they performed a procedure of electrical conduction, the alchemist removed the blanket.\u00a0<br/>Only to reveal an awakened Frankenstein that held no hesitation in eating his first victim.\u00a0Through eating his first victim, the Frankenstein gained a sense of knowledge via eating his creator\u2019s brain.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>And with knowledge comes curiosity. <br/>The Frankenstein spotted a fallen book on the ground. Within the open pages of the book, the Frankenstein read the first name he saw in bold. Having no name from his creator, the zombie Frankenstein decided to take on the name shown within the book. <br/><strong>Conrad.<br/></strong>Sadly Conrad had no supply of food to sustain him.\u00a0So Conrad lurked down the streets at night, in search of food.\u00a0Only to find the smell of something delicious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He recognized it.\u00a0The smell was similar to that of his creator\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>F o o d.</em>\u201d Conrad\u2019s mouth perked up into a grin as he made his way towards the source of the delicious smell. <br/>Then and there Conrad found a building. A hospital building. Specifically a hospital that specializes on organ donations. Thus began Conrad\u2019s nightly adventure through the halls of a hospital housing many sleeping organ donors. Kind enough to leave Conrad the food he needs to supply him.</p>\n<p>This game features a zombie who traverses a hospital to collect bags of organs, avoid a security guard, and make his way to the exit.
