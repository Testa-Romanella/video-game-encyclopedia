Open gates using logic puzzles and ctrl hotkeys\u00a0to reach the end. 18 levels to complete (or more???)</p>\n<p>Theme for the jam was \"out of control\". We applied this by having puzzles where you need to use common ctrl hotkeys (ctrl+V, ctrl+C, ctrl+X) to manipulate opening and closing doors. You gain more hotkeys as the game progresses. You also help your program regain more control of itself from the attacking malware.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Huetimes3 for partnering up for this jam!
