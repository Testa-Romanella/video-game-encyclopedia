Beginners will find the controls very intuitive and the game easily accessible but advanced players will still have their strategic planning abilities challenged!<br/><br/>To get started, simply slide the dice up from the row below so that they form &amp;quot;strings&amp;quot; - sequences of dice of consecutive values or sequences of the same die face. The more strings you can get in one move the higher your score will be! Simple, yet dangerously addictive!<br/><br/>BanzaiDice is beautifully designed in steam punk style and gives a crisp and clear image to take full advantage of iPhone&amp;#39;s retina display!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91c/91c8427725a702f1fdf39b5cebed5960.jpeg", "website": "http://banzaitokyo.com/banzaidice", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sergey Epifanov"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Sergey EPIFANOV"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
