You take on the role of a user nicknamed Bit and need to investigate the death of the previous &quot;Bit&quot; that was probably involved in illegal activity. To get through the story, you search for the files on other computers that can help to reveal the truth about your predecessor.\u00a0<br />\nHacknet combines a graphical interface with a text-based console creating the impression of real hacking software. As a rule, every mission consists of connecting to another computer, breaking its protection system and getting special privileges and access to the database. You need to complete the mission before the speed countdown reaches zero. If you fail, you\u2019ll have one more try to finish the level.<br />\nHacknet is expanded with Hacknet Labyrinths DLC that adds two more chapters to the story, new hacking tools, and a fully new soundtrack. \u00a0The game can also be modified by players.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2015-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/23b/23b69bfef2a1ce2e3dcdf1aa8ef1150b.jpg", "website": "http://www.hacknet-os.com/", "rating": 3.19, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 430, "owned": 4516, "beaten": 137, "toplay": 45, "dropped": 190, "playing": 26}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 478, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 481, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Team Fractal Alligator"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fellow Traveller", "Surprise Attack"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
