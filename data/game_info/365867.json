OR ELSE!!!</p>\n<p>When you click on the fish you get a random amount of gold, as well as a random chance that you or the fish will attack. Don't let your hitpoints go to 0!</p><p>You can buy 1 HP for 10 gold. Great deal!</p><p>You can buy an autoclicker for 200 gold. Will give you 1 gold/sec/clicker risk-free!</p><p>You can buy defenders for 300 gold. They decrease damage that the fish deals to you. Buy enough and fish damage will be converted to health added.</p><p>You can buy attackers for 400 gold. They increase the damage dealt to the fish.</p>\n<p>In fact I could probably just embed the entire game within its description...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T09:00:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f52f597e7e9748b1b31cb1d8cb61858.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Quantum Quantonium"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
