But this game is a 1D first person dungeon crawler. <br/><br/>This game was made for the Uni-Dimensional JAM from bboarGames!<br/><br/>The game help explains it in a better way. But you are put inside a 1 dimensional dungeon in thedimensionless\u00a0 perspective of the player.<br/>There you will solve puzzles and fight monsters.<br/><br/>The fun of this game is to find out exactly what is going on. What are the items you are touching and where and what they do. Thats why its advised to firstly play on HARDCORE mode with headphones. (Yes, sound is part of the game). But be advised, you are going to need a very big brain to end the game on HARDCORE mode. When you give up, you can go to \"normal\" mode where it basically shows where everything is and where you are, spoiling the game, but making it way easier.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:43:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59f/59f235aa463e12e0012fe65bd1b6852b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hamesame"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
