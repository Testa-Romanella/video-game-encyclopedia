For the best experience use or emulate a PAL machine but it does work on NTSC.</p>\n<p><strong>Loading Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>If you wish to play on real hardware then you will need a means of transferring the FREEZE64.D64 file to a real disk or a device such as SD2IEC or Pi1541 to mount the disk. Type LOAD \"*\",8,1 then RUN to play.</p>\n<p>For emulators, simply drag and drop the FREEZE64.PRG file into the emulator window or load it from the \"mount disk\" menu and follow instructions for real hardware.</p>\n<p>For TheC64 machines, copy the FREEZE64.PRG file to your USB stick and launch it via the console's menu system.</p>\n<p>Playing Instructions:</p>\n<p>It is a FREEZE-ing Chrismas Eve and Santa has presents to deliver. See how many parcels you can drop into chimneys before the moon sets, but watch out for Chinese lanterns, bats and burglars who are on the prowl to try to spoil Christmas!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use a joystick in port 2. Directions move Santa around the screen and fire drops a parcel.</p>\n<p>Press P while playing to pause the game<br/></p>\n<p>Press Q while paused to quit to the title screen</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Graphics and game design: Aurora Richmond (age 10)<br/></p>\n<p>Programming\u00a0and sounds:\u00a0Mike Richmond</p>\n<p>Playtesting: Aurora Richmond, Oliver Richmond, Vinny Mainolfi, Furroy and\u00a0\u00a0Shallan50k.</p>\n<p>Producer: Vinny Mainolfi for FREEZE64 fanzine www.freeze64.com</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy and Prosperous New Year!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T02:52:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b8715c7f88851514773dab42fed61423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MikeRichmond"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
