That book is mine, and you have stolen it. Do not worry, I left a, let us call it, a gift inside.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You truly believed nothing would happen if you traced its devilish markings tonight? It is Halloween, you know?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you finished with the last symbol, you unleashed my son, a ravenous beast of a boy. Yes, he may have slaughtered all of your friends, but you, you are a clever one, taking to cover under your bed like a child. The blood of your friends seeping between the floorboards, staining your small pathetic hands.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>It would seem that you still have the book even. Be a good kid and send him back to me, will you? I'll forgive all that has happened then. All you must do is retrace the symbols of my book.
