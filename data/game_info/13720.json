Developed by LucasGame Studios, Corona MotorSport features a constantly improving physics system based on Nvidia PhysX 3. Corona MotorSport also features realistic graphics and vehicle models. The game is almost entirely coded in C# and built in Unity 5.<br/>LucasGame Studios is an indie game studio that was founded in 2012.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Racing AI</strong><br/>Now featuring Racing AI! Race against up to 10 other cars in the new action-packed race mode.<br/><br/><strong>Advanced Tire Model</strong><br/><br/>Traditionally, Unity-based racing games use WheelColliders to simulate wheels in-game. These only detect a single contact point on the wheel, which is suitable for most arcade-styled games. Corona MotorSport uses a Tire Model that recognizes multiple contact points on the wheel to improve realism and suspension/handling simulation.<br/><br/><strong>Beautiful Graphics</strong><br/>Corona MotorSport features top-of-the-line graphics with constant tweaks and improvements each update.<br/><ul><li>Realtime Reflection Probes - creates the base layer of reflections in the game, very low performance cost<br/></li><li>Screen Space Reflections (SSR) - Adds onto reflection probes to provide accurate, higher resolution reflections.<br/></li><li>Dynamic Time and Weather system - Test your skills in rain, fog, snow (seasonal), sun, night or day!<br/></li><li>Next-Gen Post-Processing - Bloom, Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) based Color grading/Tonemapping, Cinema-Quality Depth of Field and more come together to create a beautiful racing experience<br/></li><li>Physically based shading - High quality environment shaders based on Shader Model 5 with dynamic rain and snow coverage support combined with next-generation car shaders (clear coat and procedural flake generation)<br/></li><li>DirectX 11</li></ul><br/><strong>Real-Time Damage Physics</strong><br/>Want to f*** up your car beyond all recognition?
