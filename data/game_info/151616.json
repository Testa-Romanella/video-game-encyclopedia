You fend of strange monsters, and scavenge weapons.</p>\n<p>In this game I thought about the mechanics possible when you have \r\nsome features trigger multiple actions. I tried to encourage the player \r\nto consider twice before firing their weapon, because it would also \r\nchange the environment, and use some metal. When collecting metal the \r\nplayer also exchanges their weapon, which affects strategy, as the \r\ndifferent guns use a different amount of metal and have a different \r\nrange.</p>\n<p>Created In Game-Maker;\u00a0 All sounds were created by me <br/></p>\n<p>Intended to be ran on windows<br/></p>\n<p>Created solely by myself: Steve</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91b/91bcae5dd34381b3cea0eec70e11c3c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mostly Mirth"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
