Will you get it?</p><p>---</p><p>I created this game in Twine\u00a0as a way to show my feelings and how to try to deal with them. Sort of like self-therapy. Maybe many of you will know what I'm talking about when you play it.</p>\n<p>I hope you like it and forgive me if you see some mistakes about my English as it's not my main language... but I did my best! &lt;3 I really hope you like it.

But you have also to survive and\u00a0there are some actions, like:</p><ul><li>Adding firewood: it's very important to keep the bonfire alive. If you see its light is going out, you may add firewood. The more you add, the longer the bonfire will live. If you don't add firewood to the bonfire, you won't survive because beasts may attack you.</li><li>Eating: if you're getting\u00a0hungry, you should eat. There are four types of food you may get if you look for food in the forest: apple, mushroom, coconut and blueberry. Some of them may fill your stomach\u00a0more than others. If you don't eat, you won't survive.</li><li>Looking for food: if you run out of food in your bag, as you may see in the icon on the game, you may look for food in the forest. Remember that the stronger is the bonfire light, the easier will be to look for food.</li><li>Talking: this action allows you\u00a0to advance in the story. It's simple as reading.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T02:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d17/d175b31ea488825e5c4f15bab21c755b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nat Morillo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
