While this earns them a few free meals, not all of the adults are so easily fooled, and when the kids get noticed by a one of the attendees, they'll immediately try to catch the naughty children...but they're in for a surprise, because one of the kids swiped some fireworks and they are determined not to get caught.</p>\n\n<p>Nordic Game Jam 2023 Submission</p>\n\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Andreas Feldstedt - Programming<br/></p>\n<p>Arseny\u00a0Dremin - Programming<br/></p>\n<p>Eva Christensen - Art<br/></p>\n<p>Karuni Bavananthan - Art<br/></p>\n<p>Lani Feldstedt - Design</p>\n\n\n<p>kirenyama - Culture consultant and fan of egg custard bun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T14:56:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/221b00d55697fd01e9bfa6388cffdd63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Loaded Dice"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
