The puzzle is solved when all crates are pushed into the right places. The boxes can only be pushed, never pulled, so you have to be careful not to push them into a corner where you can't get them out again. You can only push one crate at the time.</p>\n<p>If you made a wrong move, you can return it with the \"undo last move\" button.<br/>If you don't know what to do, you can use the help and get the level solved (the button with the picture of the light bulb).</p>\n<p><strong>Push Box Microban features:</strong><br/><strong>250+</strong> challenging<strong> levels</strong><br/>Beautiful 3D environment<br/>Undo moves using the back button<br/><strong>Show level solution</strong><br/><strong>No in-app purchases</strong><br/><strong>No ads</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Puzzle Packs:</strong><br/>Microban - Author: David W.
