UPLOADED THE GAME BUT IT HAS BUGS THAT DONT APPEAR IN UNITY, THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE BUT PLEASE IF YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS COMMENT ABOUT IT!</p><p>The known bugs:</p><p>-fire sound not working</p><p>-enemy\u2019s not changing sprites (from raw to cooked and then to burned)</p><p>-enemy\u2019s not detecting when they are cooked so they don\u2019t generate points</p><p>-enemy\u2019s do detect when they could die and spawn ash but the enemy gameobject does not get deleted.</p><p>Hello there this is my hopefully working version of my VimJam3 participation Kitchen Kerosene. The game has not been worked on after the deadline so hopefully you can play it in its bugged, glitched and hopefully playable state.</p>\n<p>You are a cook who has to prepare meals using his jetpag which you can use as a flamethrower. Bake your food just well enough but be careful not to burn it because the customers hate that!</p>\n<p>I had a blast making this game so I'm incredibly sorry I couldn't submit it correctly. Please leave your feedback down below but don't rate the game in the VimJam3 because that wouldn't be fair to my fellow game developers!(but thats logical i think).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:51:36", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FastAlpaca"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
