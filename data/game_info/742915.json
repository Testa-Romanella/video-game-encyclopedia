Now, Fabo is in trouble and needs your help, Omniberry plants started to wilt all at once, and bits of dark magic appear to have returned. Now you ask yourself the following:</p>\n<p>-Who is pulling the strings?\r\n</p>\n<p>-Who wants to get rid of Fabo?\r\n</p>\n<p>-What is going on on the island?\r\n</p>\n<p>-Can you stop the dark force?\r\n</p>\n<p>-Will there be a happy ending?\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is made in the same environment as the previous game, however, I discovered several ways on how to use more of the program's potential. While people ingame may be depicted more simple, and most lack hair, it is kept this way as the options I could've used to give detail is rather limited. I hope you enjoy the game!\r\n</p>\n<p>#adventure #rpg #textadventure #retro\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:28:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd5/fd569a54b64d16eb53a43905adf38d5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FaboDevGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
