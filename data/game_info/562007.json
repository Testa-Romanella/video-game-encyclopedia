Collide with the space dogs in order to rescue them; the more space dogs you have the more powerful your rocket ship could be. The improvements can be added to the weapons, shields or thrusters of the ship.</p>\n<p>The theme of the game jam is \"Stronger together\", the space dogs that you rescue along the journey apply to the theme.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game and please let me know if a undesired bug decides to pop up! I know it is pretty simple, but I enjoyed the procces of making this game.</p><p>Be sure to play it on full screen mode for a better experience and feel free to download it, the game has a functional save system to store the stages and the number of rescued space dogs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:44:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dc/5dc203fa0abf3ab035d16cd92ad72a51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spiderhead20"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
