So I woke up one weekend and told myself to JUST FINISH SOMETHING.<br/><br/>So I built a TOTALLY ORIGINAL prototype based on the classic Snake game that used to come built in to the Nokia phones of the late 90s and was the bedrock of mobile gaming. Took me two hours to build the base game, and nearly two weeks to do the last 10% to get it to this point. This might be it, or I might actually get it to version 1.0 status. Having a lot of fun working on it at the moment and got too many ideas to cram in to what is essentially a stupid rip off of Snake.<br/><br/>I certainly don't expect you to pay for this, but if you could leave me a comment or feedback that will motivate me to keep working and... I DID IT. I FINISHED SOMETHING! (Well, version 0.15 anyway)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:45:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/1175306fcefb41f60b301ba58bd0fe83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["designersoup"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
