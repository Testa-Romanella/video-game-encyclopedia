No fixed classes, and skills can be re-allocated as often as you wish. Hire more agents while leveling corporation: up to 20 crew members to play with, allowing for simultaneous and coordinated activities, both on stations and in space.<br/><br/><strong>Build ships and sail through the space</strong>: Corporations will build fleets of vessels that Agents can pilot in space. Every ship is unique: fill the ship hull with components and create custom outfits.<br/><br/><strong>Lead fleets in cinematic space fights</strong>: engage in 3D, RTS-like combat action against your corporation's enemies.

The game works the same way on every system, and the same persistent universe will be always there when switching from your desktop PC to your tablet.

Period.<br/><br/><strong>No \"pay to win\"</strong>: should we ever decide to have microtransactions in the game, it will be for vanity items only, with absolutely no advantage in game: maybe a fancy paint for a ship, or a unique agent portrait, but no more than that.<br/><br/><strong>We listen</strong>: we made this game so that players can have fun.
