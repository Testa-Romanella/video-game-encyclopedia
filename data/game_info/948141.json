There is no movement grid and no rigid turn system to slow you down.<h3>Synopsis</h3>    The Fighters guild has a high bar for entry. They want you to delve deep into the Dungeon of Doom and return to the surface with the Amulet of Yendor. A perilous quest few have completed, for within the dungeon are terrible monsters, devious traps, and mystifying magical items. <br/>    To survive you'll have to identify the items, navigate the dark labyrinths within the dungeon, and fight your way past the monsters. With enough skill and a decent amount of luck they say it can be done. Give it your best shot!<br/><br/><h3>Features</h3>Just like in the roguelike days of yore, there are<br/><ul><li>    Procedurally generated levels<br/></li><li>    Perma-death<br/></li><li>    An alphabet's worth of monsters<br/></li><li>    Many magic items with different effects including rings, potions, wands, and more!</li></ul><br/>But in ROGUE-FP there\u2019s also<br/> <ul><li>   Sprites/textures for everything<br/></li><li>    First person controls<br/></li><li>    Smooth turns<br/></li><li>    Synth soundtrack<br/></li><li>    A difficulty level for every level of skill, including one that removes item identification</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T06:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e3/5e382c58fc4965729440e2ddcd6e6b48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Jurax Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Jurax Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
