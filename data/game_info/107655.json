We need YOUR help to develop the necessary software suite to control our rover as it explores an exciting, and oddly small, new world.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe are not joking. We are providing you with a fully simulated CPU with a proprietary instruction set. The challenges that you must solve can only be completed using your own willpower and creativity. Well, those and assembly.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THE MOST MODERN ADVANCEMENTS IN MODERN COMPUTING ADVANCEMENTS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tx2A Industries is at the forefront of technological advancements. Some have said that progress such as we have created for you today would not be seen until the distant year of 1985. However, we \r\n\t<strong>refused</strong> to accept their inferiority as our own. We did what was impossible and created these advancements today, April 24, 1977.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THE END OF THE FLAVOR-TEXT:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHey, everyone. Finally reached the end of yet another exciting Ludum Dare. If you are still reading this, then you have successfully trudged through all of the text I had too much fun writing. Anyway, as I said, uP-8 is a game where you program real assembly to control a simulation of a rover. You have to use your own creativity to create solutions to each level. The catch is that you have limited memory, registers, and lines with which to work. Give it a whirl and let us know what you think!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOh, and also, we have included a manual. Not only do I want you to check it out because I spent an entire weekend writing a 20-page manual, you will not be able to finish even the first level without it.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGood luck and Godspeed.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01df15fac0785facbc8770b16f2efc36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Schmaron", "Spaceman1701"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
