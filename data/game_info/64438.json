Specifically, imagine an amalgam of Mario's fluid controls, the double-jump and rapid-fire of Ghosts 'n Goblins, and the themes of Crystal Caves.<br/><br/><strong>You spot a cave entrance in the distance.<br/><br/>Setting your ship down on an alien planet, you grab your pickaxe and blaster with a gleam in your eye. What nefarious obstacles and challenging foes will stand before you and the mountains of treasure you know are hidden within?<br/><br/>Step forward, fire up your jetpack and enter, the XENOCAVE.</strong><br/><br/>That's right -- there's no princess or world to save, no clich\u00e9d plot. As an explorer and archaeologist, curiosity and the will to overcome great odds are all the motivation you need!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd4/dd42e048240b72fcdc5a22214bf7033a.jpg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UxqMagPkn4&amp;t=24s", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BLUE LED"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BLUE LED"], "esrb_rating": null}
