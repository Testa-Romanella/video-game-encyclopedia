After that, the white cat was taken to the abyss entrance. While exploring the abyss, the cat found that some monster there would\u00a0drop dungeon tokens when defeated.\u00a0 But they are just\u00a0appear sometimes unless he goes deeper into the abyss. As he explored deeper, he found a strong monster that make his ear displeasing. And he continued going deeper and deeper. Will he be able to find the dark secret of the abyss? Will he survive or not depends on you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Merchant: You forget to mention about me. You can buy thing at my shop. But don't look around to find some dropped tokens.\u00a0There are something hidden \"in the dungeon\" (Believe me only in the dungeon). If you pay attention you may find it. The gamemaster is really like to hide things.<br/></p>\n<p>There are 3 kinds of gameplay involving the use of dungeon generator. They are\u00a0similar though.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>If it is bad dungeon room, blame it on the God of Random and me<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Fishes are consumed when player is not supposed to be \"alright\"\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Everytime you came back to the entrance merchant, the temperature will reset and change like the weather. If you have 35 or more, it's best to go deeper.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>You can even custom the jump speed some time.</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you have found <strong>a bug, be sure to comment so I could fix it.<br/><br/></strong><strong>Source</strong> code will be release after the jam in case someone finds a bug and I have to fix it.

And when I played the game to testing I found even more bugs. It took 12 hours to fix all those bugs.
