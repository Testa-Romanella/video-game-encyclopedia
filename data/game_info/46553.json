Let me know what you think by posting on the discussion boards!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Don't Feed\" uses an isometric 2D art style, which helps to maximize the number of units that can be on the battlefield. There are no heroes, because I feel that controlling a hero warrants its own game (e.g. \"DOTA\"). This game instead focuses on the RTS play style.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/543/5431f9505d455108f7b7d7bcc8136782.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 108}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jameson Saunders"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jameson Saunders"], "esrb_rating": null}
