(At the start of each level, the cursor is in the bottom left of the board.) Shift the cursor <strong>across the edge</strong> of the board to loop it around to the opposite edge. Press Shift as you move the cursor to move its <strong>entire row or column</strong> with it (looping at the ends).</p>\n<p>Shift the <strong>board</strong> by creating a match--three of a symbol in a row, horizontally or vertically. Matched tiles disappear, your cursor and unmatched boxes stay in place, unmatched balls move in the direction of the shift, and new balls are added to the board. (If new matches form during this process, the shift continues as the process repeats until they don't.)</p>\n<p>Shift your <strong>level score</strong> upward by one during a board shift if anything removed in the shift has your <strong>target symbol</strong> (named in the bottom left), downward by one otherwise. If your score drops to or past zero, it's <strong>game over</strong>! (At the start of each level, your score is 5.)</p>\n<p><strong>Loop</strong> through targets and board shift directions by making matches, and through levels by clearing all of the boxes:</p>\n\n<p>Shift to the <strong>next level</strong> (without clearing the current board of boxes) at any time by pressing the Escape key. Press the Shift and Escape keys together to <strong>end the game</strong> at any time, and view the game's statistics.</p>\n<p>Shift the <strong>music</strong> from one track to the other by pressing T, between unmuted and muted by pressing M, and between playing and paused by pressing P.
