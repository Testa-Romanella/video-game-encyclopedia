You are controlling a ship and fighting against endless hordes of enemies. However there is one unique twist, you can't move freely.\u00a0 Instead, your movement restricted by two elliptical orbits. When your ship is located on the first orbit it can shoot towards the center of the screen and when it is located on the second orbit it can shoot outwards the center of the screen, killing enemies behind its back. This movement restriction in pair with specific enemy behaviors creates a unique game dynamic.</p>\n<p>To survive constantly move,\u00a0 change orbits in response to threats, collect power-ups and bonus weapons.
