It's a bit buggy, but I did something different for it. You have a full body and at the moment your fighting Red Capsules, but I'm hoping to replace that in the future. Now with that being said I have a full time job now and I'm trying to join the Army so updates will not be often with any of my games. It's the main reason I've been inactive for so long. I hope y'all enjoy this prototype, let me know what you think any feedback would help!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T06:00:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c43/c4359c6d5c307c158fefd2f5f8f77c5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeepDownGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
