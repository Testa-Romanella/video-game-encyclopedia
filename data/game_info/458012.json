{"id": 458012, "slug": "yellow-cab", "name": "Yellow Cab", "name_original": "Yellow Cab", "description": "<p>Yellow Cab is a proof of concept/demo I created over the course of several weeks. The game is short, with only a single level that lasts two minutes, yet with a fair deal of replayability for some relaxing fun.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I welcome any and all feedback regarding the game, as I\u00a0hope to someday make this into a longer product. If you would also like to see this achieved, please feel free to make a donation, any amount is appreciated. The game is free but all donations go a long way towards this project.</p>\n<p>Thank you and I\u00a0hope you enjoy Yellow Cab as much as I've enjoyed making it!</p>\n\n<p>P.S. While the title image and game's title on itch.io is \"Yellow Cab\", the files refer to it as \"Yellow Car\". This is due to my inability to decide on a title, I apologize for any confusion it might cause. Also while the pedestrian and car assets within the game are mine and all objects are made using Unity's Probuilder, I do not own the background music, which is a demo track from FL Studio called \"One Day (Funky Mix)\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T02:58:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4f/b4f73e9e6851c2327e048ccbcf98e183.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WingsOfWax"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
