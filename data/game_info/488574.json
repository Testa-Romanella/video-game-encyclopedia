No time like the present to go explore!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Scrabdackle</strong> is a scribbly hand-drawn game about exploring a large inter-connected world, finding secrets, and facing major challenges.<br/></p>\n<p>A 2D top-down action-adventure focused on exploration and combat, Scrabdackle is the journey of a novice wizard getting to know their own strange world for the first time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Discover new, intertwined areas like the Ducklands and Blustergust Peak. Find new abilities that allow you to push further into Scrabdackle, and find something curious behind every corner.</li>\n<li>See the world at your own pace, with rare progression gates and an emphasis on non-linear exploration. Although you'll need a full set of abilities to explore <em>every</em> nook and cranny, the order you approach things is entirely up to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage charming enemies throughout the world, ranging from harmless-unless-provoked to hostile. Challenges are strewn throughout the world (some hidden), and \"dungeon\"-style areas will push you to your limits before rewarding you with new powers.</li>\n<li>Major challenge arenas and boss fights will test your skills, as your low health and damage never increase, and you'll overcome by leveraging your arsenal of quick-select abilities and learning patterns and telegraphs.</li>\n<li>Or, turn on the Mage Shield's invulnerability to focus on exploration, if reflexive-skill-based challenge isn't what you're here for.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Talk to personable characters, or walk on by\u2014 control is never taken away during dialogue, although some characters may think you're rude if you just walk away mid-chat!</li>\n<li>Enjoy a whimsical soundtrack and lively, 2D cel animations hand-drawn frame by frame.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nControls, Accessibility, and Assist Features\r\n<ul>\n<li>Playable with a <strong>mouse and keyboard</strong>. Controller support is upcoming.</li>\n<li>More accessibility and assist toggle settings are planned once the game has exited demo state.</li>\n</ul>\r\nFollow the project!\r\n<p>Scrabdackle is currently a\u00a0<strong>vertical-slice demo</strong>, starting development in mid-May 2020.
