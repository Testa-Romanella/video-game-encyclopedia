There are varieties of scientific machines (steam engines, diesel engines, etc.) and magic digital circuits to control the completion of automatic control. Ores are no longer in the oven to wait for the progress bar to get to the right side, but to build a real furnace, so you should consider the flow of heat etc.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConstruction:<br/>\r\nThere are about 100 kinds of blocks currently. Background wall can be placed and removed. There are digital circuits which can be built to help you complete the establishment of automatic chemical plants.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSimulation:<br/>\r\nYou should remember one thing to play this game: Energy conservation! Pay attention to the heat conversion rate of blocks and use heat flow well.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nShortcoming:<br/>\r\nAt present, the game is more consume CPU, the painting is not perfect, and the special effects are less. I will gradually optimize it in the future, I hope you can support more!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/593/5937dbdd5ac62b51df2b8f93d7c3c56c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StoneCity  Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["StoneCity  Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
