Your goal is to kill everyone else and remain the only one alive. Do you have what it takes to be\u00a0the one?</p><p>All your actions cost action points. You can shoot within your range (1 damage - 1 action point), you can move (1 cell - 1 action point), you can gift your action points or health to other players within your range. Your range starts at 2, but you can upgrade it for 3 action points. You can also heal for 3 action points.</p><p>How do you get action points? You get 1 action point every 17 hours.\u00a0<strong>This is a\u00a0slow-paced game</strong>. And that is intentionally so: talk, unite, strategize and plan with other players in-between.\u00a0The game is going to take a couple of weeks to complete, probably, but it shouldn't require more than a few minutes of your time each day ... At least that's what the original game creator Luka Muscat thought before they had started playing.</p>\r\nGame rules\r\nTeam up and strategize!\r\n<p>For that you have chat at the bottom of this page and (probably more importantly) the ability to change your \"status\" in the right column with a text of up to 200 characters - you can use it to share your contact details, so others can contact and discuss with you privately. <strong>Play \"outside\"!</strong> In fact, the game is designed to be played outside: exchange Discord/Telegram details, organize chats, do voice calls - whatever it takes, you are free<br/></p>\r\nYou control a tank, you can\r\n<ul><li>Move  orthogonally or diagonally - click on the blue cell to move: moving one  cell takes one action point (cells where you can move are highlighted in  blue, specified with corresponding move cost depending on the distance)\r\n</li><li>Shoot  players within you range (hover mouse over them and choose how much  damage you want to deal), dealing one damage takes one action point\r\n</li><li>Kill other players, player is killed when his/her health becomes zero\r\n</li><li>Capture dead player's action points: when you kill a player, you automatically get all this player's action points\r\n</li><li>Transfer  (=gift) action points or health points to players within your range  (hover mouse over the player and choose what and how much you want to  transfer). There is no transfer fee - the player receives exactly the  same amount you transferred.\r\n</li><li>Restore health: each health point costs 3 action points (in the \"Self actions\" section)\r\n</li><li>Increase your range: each range point costs 3 (in the \"Self actions\" section)\r\n</li><li>Revive dead players by transferring them one or more health point\r\n</li></ul>\r\nYou can't\r\n<ul><li>Sacrifice your last health point to transfer it to someone else\r\n</li></ul>\r\nDead players form \"The Jury\"\r\n<ul><li>You are not out of the game\r\n</li><li>You can vote for the player you'd like to help. Every 3  votes from the jury award the player extra action point at the  \"schedule\". To vote hover the mouse over the player-cell (not player in  the right column) you'd like to vote for.\r\n</li><li>Furthermore, you can be revived if someone transfers=gifts you a health point\r\n</li></ul>\r\nOnce every 17 hours so called \"schedule\" happens\r\n<ul><li>Dead players (the Jury) each receive 1 vote(s)\r\n</li><li>Alive players receive 1 action point(s) each\r\n</li><li>In addition to regular received action points, alive player receives extra 1 action point for every 3 votes received from the jury\r\n</li><li>Votes  don't carry over, neither for alive players, nor for jury. Meaning each  \"schedule\" both jury's unused votes and alive players' remaining votes  are reset to zero.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nLast standing player wins\r\n<p>In case something is unclear, you want to join discussion or for any other reason, <br/>join game's official Discord: discord.com/invite/f5XpW3k89v <br/>or message me on Telegram (@nns2009) <br/>Watch the video that inspired the making of this game: The Game Prototype That Had to Be Banned by Its Own Studio (it might also help if you are confused about the rules).
