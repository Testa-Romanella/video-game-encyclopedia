MAY BE BUGGY!</p>\n<p>This is my first game and a tribute to one of my all-time favorite games, Portal by Valve. This game is a 2-D spin-off with many cloned elements and a few unique twists. One of such quirks is the limited supply of portals which can be topped up at any save station.\u00a0 There is, so far, a small test campaign which may or may not change moving forward. Test campaign takes about 30 mins - 1 hour so far but will expand as time goes on.\u00a0The game is intended to be presented as a Metroidvania-style title with progression focused around the collection of various power-ups that increase the mobility of your character in order to reach new paths that were otherwise inaccessible.</p>\n<p>Features a (mostly)functional\u00a0 room editor that allows you to make and test your own rooms. I did my best to try and label everything in a logical manner with tool-tips when necessary. These tool-tips can be turned off with the H key.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>W/A/S/D To Move</li><li>Q To Interact With Buttons/Switches/Save Stations</li><li>E To Pickup Boxes/Balls</li><li>SPACEBAR To Jump</li><li>W/S To Climb Ladders</li><li>SPACEBAR To Dismount Ladders</li><li>LEFT/RIGHT CLICK To Shoot Portals (With Portal Device)</li><li>SCROLLWHEEL UP/DOWN To Switch Between Gun And Portal Device</li><li>LEFT CONTROL To Look Around &amp; Laser Sight</li></ul>\n<p>DEV MODE CONTROLS:\u00a0 (subject to change or sudden removal)</p>\n<ul><li>U To Refill Portal Energy Anywhere Anytime</li><li>9/0 Change Gun Upgrade Level</li><li>O/P Change Portal Device\u00a0Upgrade Level</li><li>K/L Change Glove\u00a0Upgrade Level</li><li>M Toggle Fall Protection\u00a0Upgrade</li><li>N Toggle High Jump\u00a0Upgrade</li><li>B Toggle Black Tile Override\u00a0Upgrade</li><li>V Toggle Portal Shifter Upgrade (shift to use. lays portals with opposite facing)</li><li>C Toggle Override Upgrade (currently defunct)</li><li>X Toggle Spikeproof Shoes Upgrade</li><li>Z Toggle Cheapshot Upgrade</li><li>T Toggle Super Slow Frame Rate</li></ul>\n<p>I try to update this pretty often with new features and changes to the campaign.
