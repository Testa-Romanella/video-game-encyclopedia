With a gameplay loop inspired by tarot card readings and an amnesiac player character, the pictures reveal new facets of the past, present, and future. Like in tarot readings, photos are randomly drawn in upright or reversed positions, which create different interpretations and meanings. The story benefits from multiple playthroughs and explores ideas of memory, illness, loss, and seeing loved ones in old and new lights.\r\n<em>Made for Cal Women in Gaming's second spring Game Jam.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Instructions: How To Play\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Please use fullscreen\u00a0for the best experience! ]</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a point and click story game, playable on browser.
