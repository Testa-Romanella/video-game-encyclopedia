When he looks in those huge, watery, disturbingly pruney eyes of yours, he sees a partner. A real teammate. One half of a one-person-one-hamdillo-duo. As far as he's concerned it's ride or die and so far there's been no scientifically proven evidence that hamdillos are capable of dying. What's up with that?</p>\n\n<p>Endlessly loyal, the hamdillo will follow your commands to the last detail. He'll leap, vault, slam, flop, punt, and bounce this balloon to the ends of the earth to get the job done. Despite his meager size, he's nimble enough to focus his efforts into precise, coordinated strikes that guide his cargo through the narrowest gaps.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>It's a big job, and you've got an even bigger pair of tiny boots to fill. Are you up to the task?</p>\n<p><strong>Gamepad Recommended.</strong></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD/Left Stick to move</p>\n<p>Space/A Button to jump</p>\n<p>Shift/X Button to Sprint</p>\n<p>Escape to pause and see the leaderboards.</p><p><strong>Art by @champipen!</strong></p><p>www.instagram.com/champipen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:00:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da5ee50a3b26a4c02dbe34e4412129cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aiet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
