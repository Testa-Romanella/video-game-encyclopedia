The player can leave this home galaxy and explore an unlimited procedural universe filled with randomized other galaxies. These generate deterministically, meaning that the player can leave an area and then return to it to find the same galaxies that existed before.</p><p>Depending on the view distance, galaxies are \"packed\" into simple point sprites or \"unpacked\" into full particle systems. In this manner a large number of galaxies can be made visible in the distance without involving great computational complexity and thus performance is maintained. As I originally developed this on a laptop with integrated graphics (and which is at this time nine years old), performance is aggressively optimized for smooth play even on very weak devices.<br/></p><p>CONTROLS<br/>W/A/S/D to move<br/>Left Shift to move faster<br/>Left Mouse to rotate view<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T13:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b88f10cb0b25010d554dafadef9cdf65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["problemecium"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
