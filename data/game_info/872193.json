I have made many crappy prototypes back in my Unity days but never anything scary.<br/>My original plan was to be more like Alien: Isolation - a big ship, some AI in the vents, but it was too large and was wayyy too big for the jam.<br/>The final product is not something I am totally satisfied with, it could use some improvements, longer game play, more polish and more story.<br/>You can download the executable or play in in your browser, however the performance is not ideal and you will get stutters when going into some rooms.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>--- MISSION BRIEF ---<br/>Your mission is to recover data from an abandoned space cruiser. Sol has not received a heart beat signal for 102 days, accounting for time to reach sol, the crew has not been responding 1639 days. Lacking any technology for docking, you need to cut off a part of the ship and weld your ship to it. The only way to recover data from their computers is to optically copy each word, as their mainframes were created before the wireless revolution. Since you blew up a part of the ship, there is no oxygen, you need to use a primitive robot with tracks.<br/></p>\n<p>Get in, recover the data, get out.</p>\n<p>--- MISSION BRIEF ---</p>\n\r\nCredit\r\n<p>There is no way I could have made something like this without some help, so massive thanks to all these people:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>https://kronbits.itch.io/freesfx</li><li>https://alchemiamagicae.itch.io/abyssal-horrors-sfx-vol1</li><li>https://alchemiamagicae.itch.io/abyssal-horrors-sfx-vol2</li><li>https://alchemiamagicae.itch.io/beasts-sfx-vol1</li><li>https://managore.itch.io/m5x7</li><li>https://jestan.itch.io/pixel-texture-pack</li><li>https://alchemiamagicae.itch.io/cosmic-horror-sfx-vol1</li><li>https://little-martian.itch.io/retro-texture-pack</li><li>https://darkworldaudio.itch.io/sound-effects-survival-i</li><li>https://spaw.itch.io/ambient-spaces-vol1</li><li>https://gooseninja.itch.io/space-music-pack</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Evil-Dog/sounds/265338/</li><li>https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/?1#ibm-bios</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/h2p34/sounds/650510/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Veridiansunrise/sounds/321118/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Aris621/sounds/435238/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/ryusa/sounds/531158/</li><li>And all of my play testers!
