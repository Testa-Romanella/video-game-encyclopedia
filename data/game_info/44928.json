Anyhow, the game goes in your favour and  you win all of Booty Buns credits! But then, she asks if you would swap back her lost credits for an item of her clothing, You knew that your sister was forever borrowing clothes from her so even if you didn\u2019t want her clothes your sister probably would\u2026 so you agree! Haha! That changes the game, now it would be even more fun to see how many clothes you could get Booty Buns to give you!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMultiple outfits and cosplay costumes<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnlockable viewing gallery for each costume<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSide by side 3Dmode for use with suitable 3d TV or monitor", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/628/628764433807b881558df027758168e2.jpg", "website": "http://ingeniousfun.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ingeniousfun"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ingeniousfun"], "esrb_rating": null}
