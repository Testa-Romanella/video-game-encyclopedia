Thats Domobots. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Planned or in development features:</strong></p>\n<p>A dynamic Environment. Your characters have to learn to avoid rain, jump over water, stay away from fire, recharge at night, and stay warm in the cold as they build, work together, and explore.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>New Environment</strong><strong>s</strong></p>\n<p>Each environment holds it's own challenges. The Swamp will have your domos struggling with mud and dirtiness (raises stress, and oil consumption). Teach them to rinse off and build bridges over muddy patches or dig them up!</p>\n<p>In the snow biome snow can stick to your domos causing freeze ups, and icy wind and rain can lower their operating temperature. Equip them with internal heating components, and teach them to use heating sources. Construct all weather shelters out of available materials or go underground and build your base, it's the same temperature all year!</p>\n<p>These and a dozen other biomes are planned.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning and moods</strong></p>\n<p>Bots learn and grow with time. Connecting behaviors and events with rewards and punishments. Bots have moods. They can become \"curious\" and start exploring items behaviors and areas tagged 'unknown' to them. Or bored which can lead to new discoveries or mischief. They may even become happy and bond with another bot, following them around until the other bot becomes annoyed!</p>\n<p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing happens on it's own. It takes a team. And with so many robots running around, you can't be expected to do all the work! Over time domos will bond, and team up, some will use their unique abilities or components to lift others into hard to reach places. Others like chargebot will run around, jumping onto other bots back like a backpack to recharge them. Constructor Bot can build larger structures and deconstruct terrain tiles that are normally impenetrable, allowing you to clear environmental hazards or smooth terrain. Zapbot can even help defend against rogue robots known as 'deviants'.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>An overarching story</strong></p>\n<p>You've crash landed on an unknown world. Your crew of loyal robot friends find themselves deserted, and only <em>you</em> can help them. Avoid the dangers and hazards of this new world, and watch hilariously as your bots fumble into pits, water, electric eels, quicksand, falling trees, rolling boulders, and general mayhem, as they curiously explore, learn, adapt, and grow in this new environment. All the while overturning the true nature of deviants, <em>DomoCorp</em> and it's mysterious founder, Mr Aragato. <br/></p>\n<p>Only you can help them explore, gather, build, and learn enough to escape this new world, in DOMOBOTS.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T02:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/111/111a40dae27f6cbfa04339e8cdc2c144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fool"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
