The theme was Out of Control, so we built a game where the player has to sacrifice their control over different directions of movement to equip weapons and abilities. WASD act as the four sockets on the titular SocketBot. You start each level with four wheels equipped, but each weapon, or jump rocket, replaces a wheel. As your navigation and combat abilities increase, your maneuverability decreases in this experimental 3rd person bullet hell.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Raul Santos</li><li>Joel Swanson</li><li>Tanner Brown</li><li>Ethan Bowen</li><li>Josh Bowen</li><li>Shak</li><li>Erik Ririe</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afa4eb91378c10bdf8e9b65c80ffe95e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ErikRirie", "xTeaTurtle", "Ellysia", "singh1rocks", "jswanson993", "Mechafish"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
