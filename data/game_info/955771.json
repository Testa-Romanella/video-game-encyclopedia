Our silly lil alien protag, named Blemie, got his ship stolen by some crummy robot whilst on vacation! Said robot has placed several electric walls around the area too! How are you supposed to go back to your home planet now</strong><strong>? Well a\u00a0</strong><strong>demi-god, named Sony, takes pity\u00a0on the guy and tells Blemie to go</strong><strong>\u00a0explore and\u00a0collect OUTAGES. Outages are creatures that possess insane electrical\u00a0energy and can take out any of those barriers as long as there's enough of them. Jump, dash, drop and LAUNCH through all of the wacky areas this alien planet has to offer.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T08:31:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50a/50a64612e583f03938499c3585b1ffb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LUA COMPUTA"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
