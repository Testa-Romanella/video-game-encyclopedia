Our characters live out their daily routines, go through life events, meet new people, hang out with each other, explore new parts of the city, get wound up in wacky hijinks, and so on.</p>\n<p><em>How will your life change, and how will it stay the same?</em></p>\n<p><em>What sort of people will you meet and get to know?</em></p>\n<p><em>What secrets of the city will you discover?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Includes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>7 playbooks (Artist. Child, Fallen Star, Peddler, Oracle, Trickster and Vessel).</li><li>6 setting elements (The Eyes of the City, The Going-Ons of the City, The Ruins of the City, The Rules of the City, The Secrets of the City and the Journeys of the City).</li><li>52 Thursday events.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Other Information:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>This is just a playkit, and assumes decent familiarity with belonging outside belonging / no dice, no masters play. </li><li>A note on the \"slice of life\" label: this game is not purely slice of life. The events come in four categories: Domestic, Peculiar, Dramatic and Foreboding. The Domestic and Peculiar lean into (surreal) slice of life while the Dramatic and Foreboding events break from it. I think the game is still slice of life as a whole because it tends towards a series of life events without a grand narrative, and also because due to the fantastical nature of the City, just about anything might be considered a part of \"ordinary life.\"</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T07:27:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76f11aebbc1f585cb677d0fc703537b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dropbear Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
