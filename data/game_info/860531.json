Jump on the robots heads to kill them, if you walk out from a block onto their heads, they won't die.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The neighbouring city has been nuked, and you know that your city is next on the list, it's just a matter of time until you city is nuked too. Therefore you need to make your way past guarding robots and razor blades in order to sabotage the nuke.</p>\n<p>Made in two hours and 45 minutes for the TriJam (I can update it with the time i have left if you find any bugs). Game made in Godot and music made in BeepBox.</p>\n<p>Updated the game and added some sound effects, it took me 12 minutes of work so now I have actively worked with the game for 2 hours and 57 minutes :) Feel free to send a screenshot if you managed to sabotage the nuke.</p><p>Updated the game a second time, I fixed a bug were the bots wouldn't die sometimes even tough you jumped on their heads, tweaked the hitboxes of the trampolines a tiny bit and added four extra blocks. It took exactly 1 minute and 34 seconds so I am now on 2 hours 58 minutes and 34 seconds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T17:15:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/453/4537bcb3af1095ba0319d39e9a9ccb34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emil"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
