Survive waves of zombies and hope for the best. Will you see dawn? <strong>NOTE --\u00a0</strong>This is in the earliest, pre minimum viable product state and barely qualifies as a game at the moment.<br/><br/>I was recently inspired by the success and simplicity of Vampire Survivors. I had gotten some new toys for Unity\u00a0 a few months ago and had yet to try them out. I thought a slice of Vampire Survivors was a perfect fit for these assets. Here are some links to the main packs I am using.</p>\n<ul><li>Top Down Engine</li><li>POLYGON Apocalypse</li></ul>\n<p>I will provide a review of both products at the end of the project, assuming I get there. I'm using various other free packs for UI elements, sounds etc. I will document all the assets in the games credits before 1.0.</p>\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n<p><strong>W -- FORWARD</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>S -- BACK</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>A -- LEFT</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>D \u2013 RIGHT</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>R \u2013 RELOAD</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>SPACE \u2013 JUMP(But I wouldn\u2019t!)</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>I \u2013 INVENTORY</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>LMOUSE \u2013 ATTACK</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T10:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/847f9938b396ada0d8d6b7b5be65495f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuspiciousPackage"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
