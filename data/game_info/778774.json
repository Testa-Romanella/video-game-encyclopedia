Wizards and cute cuddly animals have been fighting for years, with territory becoming heavily contested. You are a mobile fortress tree unit, created by the Great Wizard ChunChun. One of many tree units created to defend territory against the furry menace.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>When Great Wizard ChunChun enchanted you, he gave, like he had to so many others, the gift of conscience. You seemed a little, 'odd' though.. a bit, 'different' from the typical magically embued tree. For one, you had a panting tongue and bulging eyes..almost like a dog. And two, you drooled a lot.</p>\n<p>You see, self-watering, although certainly useful, was not a common trait in magical trees. And ChunChun, upon inspection of his creation, became concerned for his reputation...\u00a0</p>\n<p>ChunChun postulated the theory that your physical appearance may have inplanted in your mind, sympathy, to the animal cause, or more accurately, the cause of choosing to 'not do anything' as the enemy passed by. An aloofness of the mind was less than ideal in his magical art. So, better sorry than safe, ChunChun implanted in you the order to destroy all things furry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now ChunChun was not considered a wise wizard by normal wizarding conventions. But he wasn't stupid either. He knew his soft fluffy beard hair could be mistaken for the quality of fur. So he spent his dying moments writing this fact down on your barked skin as the last of his lifeforce oozed out of him all over his humiliating creation:\u00a0</p>\n<p> <em>'..So became that legend of the ChunChunTree, a glorious creation embued with godlike powers by the magnanimous high-wizard whose name will forever be remembered in fondness over any and all other single split-second moments...'\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>At least, that was the end of the script ChunChun scribbled frantically on you as he took his final breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Prophetic, legendary, accomplished. The words were not lost on you as the ages rolled by. Unfortunately, at the moment, it seems you are stuck in the present. The 'ages rolling by' were a long ways off, even more so with the heavy attractive stench of wizard blood all over you. 'You', a makeshift weapons platform, who is presently stuck in the current of a war u were never meant to survive...</p>\n<p><strong>In Memorandum:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You are the ChunChunTree.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The enemy is coming.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Prepare yourself.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u25d8Skillbar\u25d8</strong><strong>(left-&gt;right;casting:bar_above_head; casted:bar_finishes)</strong></p>\n<p>`:cancel-cast (cancels the skill currently being casted, 5s cd)</p>\n<p>1:volley(casting: spams cero [slightly faster/less-dmg/inaccurate])</p>\n<p>2/ctrl:netshot(casted: 6s immobilize; decrease foe accuracy; +15s alacrity*)\u00a0</p>\n<p>3:gunflame(casted: piercing, high dmg, inflicts confusion)</p>\n<p>4:gunbash(confuse and knock foes away; ea foe hit grants +2s alacrity)</p>\n<p>5:smoke ([black screen]10s hides your location from foes)</p>\n<p>stamina-arcbar (spacebar: dodges attacks);health-orb (death if hp=0)</p>\n<p>6:heal (casted:heals +30 hp, resets cooldown of gunflame(3))</p>\n<p>q:god ([bright_green_skin] 4s immunity to all dmg)</p>\n<p>e:harden ([pinkskin]15s gain alacrity&amp;stamina when hit, -50%dmg)</p>\n<p>r:unblockable (casted:ALL TriMG bullet bypass shield+2xdmg;redglow)</p>\n<p>t:teleport (teleport to cursor; reactivate to return)</p>\n<p>*alacrity: lowers cooldowns 2x as fast (i.e. red cooldown text)</p>\n<p>**confusion: decreases foe accuracy and ability to function</p>\n<p><em>***my '2' key brokeoff -_-\u00a0so 'ctrl' was added as an alternative for 'netshot'</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u25d8Weapons\u25d8 TriMG (triple barrel machinegun), Epica (elemental casting)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u2666TriMG (keyboard):\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022a/d aim: changes angle of fire</p>\n<p>\u2022shift held: hold shift while using a/d to turn faster</p>\n<p>\u2022shift tap: sets turnrate of 'shift held' to \"R1\"(fast) or \"R2\"(slow)</p>\n<p>\u2022s tap: tag (deals special conditions to weaken foe, pierces shields)</p>\n<p>\u2022s tap2: dCannon (2 high dmg bursts)</p>\n<p>\u2022s held: mg (%chance to pierce armour/kills give stam/worsen foe aim)</p>\n<p>\u2022w held: shield (reflects projectiles)</p>\n<p>\u2022spacebar: dodge (bullets go through u &amp; hitfoe);-50 stamina</p>\n<p>*dodging while [25,49]% stamina will vastly increase cooldown time</p>\n<p>**Tap requires you press the key and release immediately.</p>\n<p>***Tap2 requires you press the key, hold a little, release.</p>\n<p>****Held requires you hold the key down, release when desired.</p>\n<p>[Practice firing with The top-left bar ('c' to hide/unhide)]</p>\n<p><strong>\u2666Epica (Mouse: lb/rb/mb=leftmousebutton..etc; skillbar 1-&gt;4)</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022cursor: aims Epica in the direction of choice.</p>\n<p>\u2022lb Tap: Cero (0.6s* cooldown, pushes/stuns foes back,+immobilizedmg)</p>\n<p>\u2022lb Tap2: Grenade(thrown:lands@cursor,knocksdown*#_of_enemies_hit)</p>\n<p>\u2022lb Held: flame (Wide-spread spam, low-dmg, burns shields)</p>\n<p>\u2022rb Held: shield (absorbs bullets, @60charges emits 10s aoe refract)</p>\n<p>\u2022mb:Pulse (aoe;destroys bullets;10s**recharge[middlemouse btn])\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Cero cooldown affected by Alacrity! i.e only 0.3s cd with alacrity!</p>\n<p>**Pulse only goes on cooldown when it's 'all' used up.

After the third it goes on cooldown and resets in 10s. OR you can hold pulse and use all of them at once, if you do this you can get 'alot' of pulses. Try quickly turning the cursor+holding mb &amp; you can cover half the map!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u263bYou have 2 shields, an invulnerability, a dmg-reduction, a potential +3-dodge chain, heal, smoke, and a teleport. If you are put in an impossible to survive situation, you can survive.</p>\n<p>\u263bgrenades are good for clumped enemies. They knock them down, hurting their accuracy, and turning friendlyfire on. The more enemies hit by the grenade the greater the dmg and knockdown time.</p>\n<p>\u263bwhen foe hp hits 0 they become a 'body'. Bodies will travel backwards and hurt the things they hit, more damage inflicted depending on the kinetic intensity of their death.</p>\n<p>\u263btriple machine gun (tmg) is weak, but it fires alot, if u hit a foe while they fire then their accuracy goes way down. Killing an enemy with tmg grants some stamina...the more shots that hit during the killshot the more stamina granted, so aiming all bullets directly gives greater benefit (foe body will also fly back further and longer). Conversely just spraying back and forth over a large area can decrease multiple enemies accuracy, making more miss you. Because it grants stamina, u can dodge the initial enemy shots...fire on the enemy...decrease their aim so u don't have to dodge anymore...then regain that stamina for the next enemy when they die. This can be a viable alternative to using your shield. When compared to other weapons: The dCannon might be able to 1shot the enemy, but it requires precise aim and it won't regen ur stamina, so you'd need to compensate with usage of your shield.</p>\n<p>\u263bgunflame(3) and gunbash (4) inflict confusion on enemies that survive them (seen by weird white halo and weird movement). These enemies shoot everything, even allies. You can use cero to push them back to corners of the map and leave them there as turrets. They are 'sorta unlikely' to hit you when far enough away.</p>\n<p>\u263bhow do shielded (yellow) enemies work?\u00a0</p>\n<p>-they are immune to all regular weapon damage except \"tags\" (tap s).\u00a0</p>\n<p>-TMG (hold s) has a ~5% chance to do damage</p>\n<p>-flame burns the shield's hp. Once broken, they will change colour to brown and dmg works normally again.</p>\n<p>-All weapon effects are still active against shielded enemies. So TMG still negatively affects the foe's aim, cero still flings them back etc. Gunflame/gunbash still confuses them (useful gimmick); netshot still temporarily immobilizes them and hurts their accuracy.</p>\n<p>-'R' (the unblockable eye) allows all TriMG(s) attacks to pierce and do 2xdmg (active on red glow). tags do 3x dmg.</p>\n<p>\u263beasy way to 1v1 shielded enemies: shoot a small burst of flames at them then immediately start casting gunflame(3). u can use ur keyboard shield(w) to block while ur doing this. Otherwise its suggest you aim a shield at them while casting 2/3/4 to inflict some kind of condition to nullify their aim.\u00a0 Immobilized (2/ctrl)\u00a0foes take extra damage vs cero. So netshot+cero can kill even a shielded foe.</p>\n<p>\u263bspeaking of netshot(2/ctrl): this grants a lot of alacrity. you can use it when a fight has 'wound down'\u00a0to quickly regenerate your heal(6). Think of netshot as a way to makeup for any previous damage taken.<br/></p>\n<p>\u263byou can shoot yourself. particularly via fire or grenades.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u263bfoes hit by grenades have a habit of shooting their allies afterwards.</p>\n<p>\u263bimmobilized foe bodies go flying 'exponentially' when they die? Yes.</p>\n<p>\u263btime the netshot well and u can immobilize tougher foes right infront of you, where inaccuracy won't matter i.e. '1' volley. Immobilized foes take ExTRA damage from cero (since they can't move they can't travel with the bullet to diffuse the energy, so it builds up on them and explodes). Combine with dCannon and even the SquirrelGod becomes scared.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u263byou can knock enemies into grenade explosions, sorta hard tho</p>\n<p>\u25d8\u263a\u263b\u2665\u263b\u2660-Instructions End-\u2660\u263b\u2665\u263b\u263a\u25d8</p>\n<p>\u25d8\u263a\u263b\u2665\u2660--GoodFortuneToYou--\u2660\u2665\u263b\u263a\u25d8</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u25d8Author's Note\u25d8</strong></p>\n<p>I'm out of tokens. I'm out of tokens. I'm out of tokens. But no, seriously, I'm out of tokens! Pico8 has 'some' -_- limits: character limit...cpu/ram limit...size limit...but tokens...token limits are the worst and I've hit them for the first time. Without more tokens I can't add anything more to the game. And the only fixes basically butcher readability and cpu performance. So you'll notice some cut corners, for example..the trees....sometimes they grow right ontop of you right? Blame Tokens! Bullets not traveling behind trees? Blame Cpu/ram limits. No third alt melee weapon and alt skillset!??!! No nice fade-in/out effects between scenes!??!?! bLAME tokens! No weapon particles shooting everywhere on hit/fire!??!!? TOKENS... Those are actually annoying to do in general -_-, but TOKENS!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>*A week or so after the Jam is over I will post an updated version of the game. I want to keep polishing things and there are\u00a02 bugs atm I\u00a0want to fix: One is some offscreen stuff ..sent under the ui to the\u00a0top left corner.\u00a0Two is during lategame when the green mobs spawn specifically near the last 80seconds of the game....sometimes enemies and bullets\u00a0onscreen start 'shifting' and 'dying' and ya ..but its temporary and won't hurt you. This is my first 'full' pico8 game, and it understandably has me upset at how small the game really has to be and that\u00a0I\u00a0can't do the things I want to do at this point. Regardless, it's a good milestone. Future games made for pico8 are going to be ..small and aimed at learning specific concepts rather than making a game full of gameplay and story.</p>\n<p>tweet me @Cerbyo1 if you have any suggestions for balance/fixes/controls. If you don't have a mouse middle button, or ur mouse and keyboard\u00a0keys are broken like mine are (|-hugs-|), what alternative buttons would u want binded? etc<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T08:44:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cb/7cb389b14001d93a31764f91c14d6d24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cerbyo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
