It is just a preview for what the finished demo, and finished game will be like!***</p>\n\n<p>When someone is truly hated, they may find themselves forced out of the safety of the light and into the unforgiving dark. \u201cThe Dream of Shadowlands\u201d follows a girl facing this very dilemma, waking up in a strange, twisted world unlike the one she knows. Forming an alliance with a demon, she must traverse this nightmarish place to find her way home.</p>\n\n<p>\"The Dream of Shadowlands\" is a top-down rpg inspired by the RPGMaker horror niche. It features art assets that were drawn traditionally with ink and paper,\u00a0and a retro style based on 90's anime.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Currently in development, this is my very first game and I\u00a0am\u00a0a solo dev so new content comes a bit slowly.\u00a0I\u00a0will occasionally upload work in progress builds here leading up to the official demo!
