Mechanics are largely based on RTS's with the exception that you can move your \"farms\" in the form of fishing boats and your \"base\" in the form of the flagship. This was produced for a Game Design class in networking, so the rest of the mechanics of the game are by design to fit the criteria of the project. Its very simple stuff like building units, capturing control points, and countering enemy strategies using the rock-paper-scissors nature of the ships.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information, click the \"?\" buttons in the game to learn more about the different parts of the interface.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ea/0ea63bce2633b1ec87a0df2cce1a60cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChristopherPoole"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
