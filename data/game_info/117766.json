Last one there has to pay.\r\nThis is the take home version of the popular tech-news show Awesome Hardware's, \"Faceoff\" segment. See what hilarity and hijinks YouTubers Paul of Paul's Hardware and Kyle of Bitwit\u00a0get into.\r\n\r\nThis is less a game and more interactive fan art of some of the techtubers that I follow. I've been following Paul and Kyle since they were at Newegg, as they are entertaining, informative and make a great duo. This is my first game created in Unity. It requires 2 people to play, as the Awesome Hardware podcast is a two person operation. 10-key\u00a0keyboard is needed.\u00a0- John.\r\n\r\nAwesome Hardware: Faceoff, featuring:\r\nPaul of Paul's Hardware - www.youtube.com/user/paulshardware\r\nKyle of Bitwit - www.youtube.com/user/awesomesaucenews\r\n\r\nOther youtubers making cameo appearances:\r\nJay of JayzTwoCents - www.youtube.com/user/jayztwocents\r\nLogan of\u00a0Tek Syndicate - www.youtube.com/user/razethew0rld\r\nLinus of Linus Tech Tips -\u00a0 www.youtube.com/user/linustechtips\r\nLuke of Floatplane - www.linustechtips.com\r\n\"Tiny\" Tom Logan aka TTL of\u00a0OC3D - www.youtube.com/user/timetolivecustoms\r\nDmitry of Hardware Canucks - www.youtube.com/user/hardwarecanucks\r\nWendell of Level1 Techs - www.youtube.com/user/teksyndicate\r\nSteve of Gamers Nexus - www.youtube.com/user/gamersnexus\r\nGordon of PCWorld Videos - www.youtube.com/user/pcworldvideos\r\n\"Joker\" of\u00a0Joker Productions - www.youtube.com/user/jerzybakes420\r\nBryan of Tech YES City - www.youtube.com/user/bryaneasy\r\nFractal Josh of Fractal Design\u00a0- www.youtube.com/user/fractaldesignna\r\nRyan, Allyn, Josh &amp;\u00a0Jeremy of\u00a0PC\u00a0Perspective - www.youtube.com/user/pcper\r\n\n<p>Concept, Coding, Character Art, Building &amp;\u00a0Level Design: John Edgett</p>\n<p>Open sourced art assets used:</p>\n<p>Trees\u00a0 -\u00a0C.
