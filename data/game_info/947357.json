In the games fictional universe, it is like ours with the same solar system but expect there is an extra planet. This planets name is 'Cayings' and it appears that there is some unidentified chemicals and substances on it that scientists think they could use for planet Earth, but a problem they realise is that the planet is inhabited by a unknown species that appears to have lots of strength, wants to own the entirety of Cayings and get rid of all unknown other species that aren't them. It was decided by the humans of Earth to send the strongest and most best of the best to get rid of these creatures and return samples of various things on the planet and send it back to Earth. You're one of the chosen people to go there and you get specially designed armour and weaponry for this mission to try and succeed. (this isn't the entirely finished game so there will be some things that won't or will be in the finished game such as you can't take damage or die)</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD or arrow keys for movement, left mouse click for shooting and mouse position aims the gun, right click to place down a landmine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T10:01:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64d8013fa1c0a65ab63f17dfe07d39d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samtube007"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
