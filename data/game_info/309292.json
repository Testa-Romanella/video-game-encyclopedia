Then once your done setting the cards they're compared to the AI placed cards. The face value winner gets both cards. Damage is calculated by looking at the suits, subtracting 1 or 2 to the losing suit's value and then taking the difference between the higher value and subtracting it from the corresponding tower's health of the loser.<br/>There's a better explanation in the \"Please Read\" file.<br/>I would LOVE to hear any feedback and hope that you guys enjoy what I have made so far.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T02:55:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/542/542e403bf7de49d42afdd93ee6731226.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quizfox"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
