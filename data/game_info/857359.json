Use them  wisely because they use one charge of your battery (which can be bought  at the shop).    </p>\n<p>Controls  \r\n</p>\n<p>Move: WASD Keys    </p>\n<p>Jump: Space Bar    </p>\n<p>Shoot: E Key    </p>\n<p>Interact: R Key    </p>\n<p>Place Flag: F Key    </p>\n<p>UI Interact: Enter Key / Mouse Left Click    </p>\n<p>UI Navigation: Arrow Keys    </p>\n<p><strong>Note:  To learn about the controls for a game pad, visit the  \"controls\" menu  in the game.
