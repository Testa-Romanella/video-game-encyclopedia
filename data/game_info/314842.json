Unfortunately we're a bit understaffed right now, so it's all up to you to make sure that things run smoothly (at least for as long as you can).</p>\n<p>This is a game made hastily for Ludum Dare 44. I\u00a0didn't have much time to test it much, so I don't actually know if it's fun, but it looks pretty cool at least. I don't even know how to begin to explain it.\u00a0You control a man working at a mint, who must feed the production of coins as well as protect the machines from crazy people that break in and try to destroy everything.</p>\n<p>Created mainly using Unity 2018.3.11 and Krita 4. Audacity, Pro Tools SE, and BFXR for the sounds and music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:53:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/234ae76d0afbc0ba4cdfa2df5cfac261.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["noitatropsnart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
