A Top-Down style Adventure/Puzzle game with some RPG elements. It features Flickerless Grayscale GFX (thanks to Durk Kingma&#39;s Grayscale Package), lots of Items to collect, crazy Enemies, a complex story-line(for a calc game anyway ;P) and more! Should also work fine on a TI-84+. Be sure to check it out :D. Head over to www.MaxCoderz.com for more cool TI-83(+(SE)) Games! <em>Note</em> - If this game runs too slow, try changing the interrupt setting. Details can be found in the README.TXT file.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-25T23:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b01/b01872ffc4af33c887c1543e30e9dd7d.jpg", "website": "https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/331/33153.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
