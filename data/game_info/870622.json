We were tasked, with little C# teaching, to create a complete platformer in roughly 2 months. The goal of this project and class was to weed out people who were not willing to put in the effort, and I think I made an interesting thing. This all occurred in the fall of 2021.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Originally, Brynhildr was going to be a Metroidvania, but creating a combat system that felt smooth just simply didn't seem to fit in the scope. My limited programming knowledge at the time understood that scrapping the idea and focusing on the already more well-polished aspect of the game, its mobility.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When designing the levels I was looking largely at making implicit guides. Placing the obstacles in such a way that just they way it was presented allowed the player to understand how to approach them or use their tools.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Many of the challenges I\u00a0faced when developing was scripting. It is not my forte and having such little time to implement things left me in difficult situations. Understanding this, I tried to play to the strengths of what I could gather.</p>\n<p>Music by Unlike Saturn, Royalty free.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assets by Blackspire,\u00a0 Clembod, Luiz Melo (Unity Free Asset Store)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T11:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f37/f3714851f3acd6099212ef0ff769ee06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gavin jackson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
