It was based on my entry from the prior year, Unwired, and reuses the basic interface and some mechanics, but takes the gameplay in a significantly differently direction.<br/></p>\r\nNote for 7DRL Judges\r\n<p>Since this game has received post 7drl updates, I've uploaded a zip file with the official 7drl version for judging (though the changes are minor: balance tweaks, the ability to start a new game after a game over, and support for multiple font sizes). This is a zip file containing a Windows build of the game.</p>\n<p>If you would like a version supporting multiple font sizes but without any other post-7drl changes so that you can judge it without facing accessibility issues due to small fonts, please contact me.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T22:02:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2ea98fa3949ae2a12d5c2bce45decea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["illiux"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
