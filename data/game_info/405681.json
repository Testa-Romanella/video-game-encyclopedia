The guru\r\nis only \u201carmed\u201d with a passive astral phase ability that will\r\nprotect you from harm, but only momentarily, so use it wisely. This\r\ngame was made for the Wowie Jam 2.0 and has a relaxing, peaceful\r\ntheme and approach to the gameplay design. The story is about this\r\ncelestial being known as KROM Zen who is an eon old, and the last of\r\nit\u2019s kind. Struggling to make sense of the dark void, Zen now has a\r\nreason to seek connections to the past. In order to gain the wisdom\r\nof the Old Mind, Zen must pass a series of trials in the astral\r\nrealms, reaching a shrine at the end of each realm. What mysteries\r\nwill unfold at the end of this epic? Search your inner being to find\r\nthe answers.</p>\n<p>Created by Jay Reid\r\nof Tantrum games. The gameplay design was inspired by Commodore 64\u2019s\r\n\u201cThe Human Race\u201d game, while the aesthetics resemble the old NES\r\ngames.
