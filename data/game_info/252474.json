On each grid there is an emoji that appears six times. <br/><br/>Touch all six emojis to earn points, and then the grid refreshes with a different emoji of interest, and it keeps going on and on until you mind eventually fries and you can't see anything lol.<br/><br/> Depending on how fast you get, you can set the timer to 10, 8 or 6 seconds. Trust me, 6 seconds for six emojis is hard!!!<br/><br/>You can choose between food emojis and animal emojis, and you can actually switch types mid game. I like the food one better; it doesn't mess with my mind so much :)<br/><br/>Come back and rate us if you find it awesome.<br/><br/><br/>Shout out to the guys at Bensound for their awesome in game music and flaticon and emojione for their icons", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3d/a3d9963b4deefc95b32d856a133ab2ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["AppendiQs"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["AppendiQs"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
