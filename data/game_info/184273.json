It's kind of interesting for a total of five minutes then you get the point.</p>\n<p><strong>Post Development Comments</strong></p>\n<p>Camerawork; that was the theme for the fifth Game A Week. I accidentally happened on a procedural generation tutorial after having made a super basic prototype of two moving cameras. Short story: I spent way too long learning it. Long story: and I'm glad I did.</p>\n<p>The game is crap... that's probably a little harsh, it isn't fun but this was probably one of the most productive weeks in terms of increasing my understanding. Grab a friend or your second hand and give it a go, it's got some nice qualities.</p>\n<p>Also the procedural generation doesn't work in the game, it works fine in the editor... it's playable but it'll just be the same map each time.</p>\n<p><strong>Where To From Here</strong></p>\n<p>In last week's game a week (see hover) I mentioned that I wanted to use the procedural generation to add to it and I think that is exactly \u00a0what I'll do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/859588a3a3cc2c4262e4c46bcb7c9ba8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SamTheSomebody"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
