Hold this to charge your long jump while crawling!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Z' button to release the long jump. As well as showing the remaining time when held down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Press the 'Down' and 'Up' arrow keys to go prone. You can crawl\u00a0through tunnels!</p>\n\r\nDevlog\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The controls are subject to change (hopefully) when I get more things working. This is kind of very janky with wall jumping (an item on the To Do list), but for now, I just restart the cart if I get stuck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This is a very early demo with not much content, but has the basic movement coded. Originally, I started this to have a portable version of Rain World for myself. I have been working on this project off and on. With a game maker version as well before The Great Data Crash of '22. Due to the crash, I have a lot of work to do to get all of my 'in progress' games back to the level at which they\u00a0were.\u00a0For now on Pico-8, I want to work on compressing the map data to enable a larger recreation of the great, beautiful game going forward. This is my first time sharing a project for 'playtesting,' and am a beginner to coding in general. I hope to keep uploading updated versions of this and more ;) I am working on this often, so check back for newer versions and a complete webpage!</p>Quick Update\r\n<p>Thank you so much to everyone who has tested out the demo! I am overjoyed to know even a few people are seeing my game.</p><p>I have worked out a much bigger map to explore now. This update to be coming soon to this page along with more gameplay elements. I have a lot of systems already in place to make these things work. I just need to make them accessible to the player.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Thanks to everyone at Videocult for their fun game. As well as online programming tutorials and the Pico-8 community. A special thanks to my family (:</p>\r\n~Oz O'Shea", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T22:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f8/1f89bb2e91053cdd82aad1718878e886.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oswin O.
