{"id": 190353, "slug": "tofro", "name": "To&Fro", "name_original": "To&Fro", "description": "<p>To&amp;Fro will be a very quick and competitive mobile game for two local players. The pucks\u00a0on either side of the screen move up and down at increasing speed. Tapping the button will launch your puck to the other side. This also leaves a small blockade where you previously\u00a0were. Touching a blockade will drastically decrease your speed. Once your speed is depleted\u00a0you lose the game.</p>\n<p>Matches should last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. It's a game you can play with a friend while in line at a movie or\u00a0waiting\u00a0at the\u00a0goram\u00a0DMV.</p>\n<p>I plan to change the aesthetic with a later build. I don't\u00a0like\u00a0what it's shaping up to\u00a0look like. It will be changed to bubbly solid colors with a Metro-style layout. Think Threes, Google, and Mini Metro aesthetics.</p>\n<p>This first\u00a0build lacks an indicator of when your speed is too low. I intend to have sounds indicate this but I did not have time to find and implement any.</p>\n<p>This is my first game and I am pretty unfamiliar\u00a0with touch\u00a0controls.\u00a0Because of this, I stuck with key inputs for this build.</p>\n<p>I am using Unity 5.6 with the Standard Assets package.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40c/40c6dfac046870a301bed7b304d99079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheCommentator"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
