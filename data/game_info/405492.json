It's an imperfect 2.5D side-scroller that may look unprofessional to some with conflicting aesthetic.<br/>The game's story is purely humorous as it's about robots invading historical events in order to assassinate historical characters that you play as.<br/>Most things are copyrighted such as environments and sounds etc. so credits to whomever who notices their content is used as this game serves only as a demonstration of my attempt at game making with Unity.<br/><br/>Note: When I say imperfect I mean it's got bugs I kept just to laugh at and the Cleopatra level never ends so keep yourself entertained.<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/></p>\n<p>For Alexander and Columbus - Z to attack, X to Jump and Arrow keys to move<br/></p>\n<p>For Cleopatra: Up and Down arrow keys</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy and thanks for playing.
