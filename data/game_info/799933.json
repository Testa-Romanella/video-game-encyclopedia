Also, there is no file modification, the game is way shorter and there is actually an happy ending. To be honest, there is no club at all in this game (seriously, what did you expect at this point).\r\n</p>\n<p>Doki-Doki Informatique club is a visual novel where you come to help three of your fellow students to protect themselves from the dangers of the Internet. Choose well the what you will say, because it will determine the end. Game FREE, only in french (but english version is coming\u2026 eventually) and with Undertale sounds for some of the characters voices!\r\n</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: The people who made this are only students, not professional psychologists, and this game is mainly a school project: Do not try to take it seriously and do not take every event as accurate. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T09:46:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b2/3b2c202c89b2b864f6ad266c963f5063.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gaspartcho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
