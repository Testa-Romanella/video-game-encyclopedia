Challenge yourself as a space colonist on a Russian ship lost so deep in the Universe that even the strongest com ties are torn. Experience the ruthlessness of cosmos, painful past, and extraordinary phenomena unfolding aboard the ship that all mix up into horror.</p>\n<p>You are a former prisoner and the first victim of malfunctions on the ATRIA-1 spaceship. What\u2019s it like to wake up after a year of cryostasis and single-handedly fix up the ship with hundreds of unconscious people aboard? Eliminate a series of failures not only on board, but also in your own head: memory blackouts, recollection mirages, and strange visions. And don\u2019t forget, all ship resources are running low: movement capability, air, energy, freedom, and common sense as well.</p>\n<p>Weapons are not gonna help. You got only light, synthetic stimulators, and the remnants of faith in reality to rely on. All that is left is to be cautious and quiet, trying to listen closely\u2026 so what is Atria telling you?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T10:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8a98685c97e5e62049243c1e6789f1c.jpg", "website": "http://chargegs.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charge Game Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Charge Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
