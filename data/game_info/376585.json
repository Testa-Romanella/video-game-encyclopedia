I wanted more people in games that looked like me, and as I wrote his story I added a lot of the experiences I felt in life. Lots of stuff happens to Kaien, Valorem, Yami, Aqlos and all of them, but if I make this game, it better be A SIGHT TO SEE. That time's not now so I can't. If I start trying to add a story to this I'll have to take the project <strong>super seriously</strong> XD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/573/573469572d73eb41d84d8b21344948df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TitanAnteus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
