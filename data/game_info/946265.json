As a little project, I decided to use it to build a text-based game that is played in the command line console. The end result was a small game that attempts a mechanical and thematic translation of the Crash\u00a0Bandicoot games to a text-oriented platform.\u00a0The language model has been a very\u00a0interesting tool to interact with, and I am super impressed with its capabilities. I will definitely be utilising it to assist in all my future programming and creative endeavours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T15:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e649486c3d7dd8d605da0f66511cc86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarrixx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
