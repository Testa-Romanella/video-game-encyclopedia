You will be experiencing a \"realistic high school setting\" with some of your servants as your schoolmates. But there's something off with the features... the female servants have been turned into the opposite gender?!</em></p>\n<p><em><em>A silly Fate/Grand Order fangame for Valentine's Day!</em></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>*Note:<br/></strong>- Only a few select genderbent female servants are in the game.<br/>- This is a project made for practice (and fun) from drawing sprites to coding. It has no solid storyline, fancy features, and doesn't tackle deep topics. No proofreading done as well.<br/>- This has been made from January 28 to January 31, 2018. Please don't expect too much.</em></p>\n<p><strong>GAME INFO</strong><br/><strong>Size: </strong>65\u00a0mb (desktop) | 49 mb (Android)<br/><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1920 x 1080<br/><strong>Player:</strong>\u00a0Single<br/><strong>Endings:</strong>\u00a05 <br/><strong>Genre/s:</strong>\u00a0Friendship<br/><strong>Release:\u00a0</strong>January 31, 2018<br/><strong>Rate:</strong>\u00a0PG+</p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL CREDITS:<br/></strong><em>Greetings</em> font by K-Type<br/><em>KG Manhattan Script</em> by Kimberly Geswein<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0a/c0a1b8b5cf4f34093d70096e5257bc78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Soraille"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
