You receive a distress signal from a nearby planet: a Piratebot invasion! You arrive to find that Piratebots have obliterated the base camp and taken control of the working outposts and industries. <br/><br/>To win, you must destroy the Space Pirate Boss - \u201cThe Dread Pirate Robot\u201d - whose heavily-defended stronghold lies on the other side of the world.

Reclaim the world. <br/><br/><strong>FEATURES:</strong><h3>Autonauts... Automate!</h3><br/>Automate a farming business to earn gold and fund your defence campaign.
