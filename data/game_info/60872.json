Players compete based upon a first-person field of view to be the last man standing by using bombs to destroy their competition. <br/><br/>Power-ups scattered around the arena encourage players to move tactically throughout each match - having to decide between making a run to the center where more power-ups are located or heading straight for enemy players - a high risk, high reward decision. <br/><br/>Multiplayer is available for both LAN and online play, so that there is always a way for you to play with your buddies. <br/><br/>In the future, Multibombers will have a cosmetic system and client-side map customization, allowing for you to personalize your own experience in any way you see fit.
