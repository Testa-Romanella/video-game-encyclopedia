The game follows the main character, the outlaw Alice, as she \r\ngets targeted by the corrupt government of the Earth Union and needs to \r\ndeal with mysterious extra-dimensional monsters that appeared out of \r\nnowhere. As she runs through the stages, the player will experience a \r\nclassic platform action with a lot of jumping and shooting. However, \r\nwhen the time comes to pilot Seraph, her giant robot, the game will \r\nshift to a horizontal shoot'em up with even more shooting. Space Outlaw \r\nAlice is highly inspired by the classic games of the Famicom video game \r\nconsole and the mecha anime genre. Its plot and characters are carefully\r\n presented through 8-bit cutscenes between the stages.\r\n\t</p>\r\nHistory\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe year is 2378 A.D. Humanity is already expanding into space, but its\r\n progress is being held back by the corrupt regulation of Earth Union. \r\nIn addition to the inability to rely on its own government, both Earth \r\nand space are plagued by criminal activities and terrorist attacks. \r\nAlice, fearless outlaw and captain of the spaceship Valiant Gear, \r\naccepts a job to raid a military facility and gets caught up in a \r\nsituation that will determine the fate of the world. Targeted by the \r\nEarth Union army and facing the coming of extra-dimensional creatures \r\nthat threatens to exterminate all forms of life, she and her crew will \r\nneed to make a decision. Run and mind their own business or join the \r\nbattle and help everyone? <br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Retro platform action</li><li>Retro shoot\u2019em up action (with giant robots and monsters!)</li><li>2d pixel art graphics inspired by the Famicom videogame console</li><li>Awesome upbeat 8-bit music</li><li>Hidden weapons, upgrades and routes</li><li>Special attacks for when things get rough</li><li>8-bit cutscenes presenting an engaging plot</li><li>Strong female lead</li></ul>\r\nRelease\r\n<p>Space Outlaw Alice is scheduled for a Q3 2019 release on Windows PCs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da8/da8d67b65de721ce0799c138acec1f2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hissatsu Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
