{"id": 968013, "slug": "the-lotus-holidays", "name": "The Lotus Holidays", "name_original": "The Lotus Holidays", "description": "<h3>The Lotus Holidays</h3> is an experimental adventure game by Sad Mask Party, featuring an intricate, interactive story that can unfold in many unexpected ways. <br/><br/>It is quite weird, trippy and stylized, sometimes even bordering on surreal. But ultimately, it is a deeply personal tale, even if sneaky about it. It aspires to be an experience that is equally immersive and subversive.<h3>The Gameplay</h3>The gameplay is based on exploration, decision making and storytelling, with interactive dialogue and some light puzzle elements. It can also turn into a first person shooter, or even a dating simulator, but only if you want it to.<h3>The Story</h3>Deeply in need of a holiday, you enter and win an online contest for a free weekend at the \"Lotus\", a new, luxurious spa resort by the countryside.<br/>But shortly after you arrive at the place, you essentially find yourself trapped there under increasingly dubious circumstances.<br/><br/>You're told that you have been infected with a rare type of virus, meaning you'll have to go through a 5-day period of 'treatment'. But the events unfolding will soon make you wonder if any of the above is true, or if you're actually trapped in a far more sinister situation.<br/><br/>Will you cooperate peacefully or will you try to find a way out?<br/>It's on you.<h3>Features: </h3><ul><li>A rich, engaging story with lots of unexpected twists and turns.<br/></li><li>Choices matter: Depending on your actions and choices, the story can go lots of ways,<br/></li><li>Deep audiovisual immersion, with a side of sci-fi existentialism.<br/></li><li>Explore a large environment that is both charming and mysterious.<br/></li><li>Interact with lots of quirky and shady characters.
