{"id": 961247, "slug": "trans-neuronica", "name": "Trans Neuronica", "name_original": "Trans Neuronica", "description": "<strong>Trans Neuronica</strong> is a puzzle game about making connections both figuratively and literally. <strong>With each node connected, you will be facilitating interactions between AI and humans</strong>. And while you will be overheating your processors with the delightfully <strong>crunchy puzzles</strong>, <strong>the soothing electronic ambient</strong> and <strong>NES era visuals</strong> will be there to chill your mind down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On each stage, the core idea remains the same. You have to<strong> draw lines to connect nodes of the same color, without making the paths of different colors cross one another</strong>. However, each level will bring you new exciting challenges to tackle: switches, special nodes, limiters\u2026 and <strong>boss fights</strong> among other things - encounters during which your mental capacity will be tested to its fullest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While your galaxy brain will be conquering the puzzle section of the game, you will also have to make <strong>decisions on the story level.</strong> As you progress through the game you'll have to decide what to tell the humans who awakened you from slumber. Can they handle the catastrophic truth? Will they even believe you? Or, perhaps it's you who should not be so trusting?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T02:57:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/85373089fb31c8992c389337a46ccd74.jpg", "website": "https://www.evidentlycube.com/games/trans-neuronica", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evidently Cube"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hyperstrange"], "esrb_rating": null}
