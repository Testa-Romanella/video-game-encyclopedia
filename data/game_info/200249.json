This game uses audio in place of a GUI, so to know what's happening, have your speakers or headphones on. :) Left mouse to begin cast, let go to toss. Hold spacebar to wind in your lure. Hold R to reset your rod's position. Press T to check how late into the day it is, and press C to check how many fish you have caught.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/209/209efda0a9fbf2ef3957afc49b0ddc3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 12, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Elemental Zeal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
