They are the light gray dots on the radar. The radar is in the upper right corner. The player is the larger white dot. The enemy bases are in red, and the enemy boss is orange. Ore is used to repair your ship if it receives damage. The player also receives exp points for mining ore. That is done by drifting close to an asteroid and holding down\u00a0the Left Shift key. To fire use the Left Ctrl key. Ship control is done with the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>The enemy is busy mining asteroids too, as they make drones to get it from asteroids. When enough is collected a boss ship is launched that it made from the ore.</p>\n<p>As you go up in level your shots do more damage and things get more dangerous.</p>\n<p>If you destroy all the enemy bases you will be teleported to your hanger\u00a0and new enemy bases will teleport in.</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0I did not get time to add all the features I had planned. Life got in the way and took over a week of time that I\u00a0had planned on using for this game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22c/22c17d2f388d12eb13646044fa840615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Panther Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
