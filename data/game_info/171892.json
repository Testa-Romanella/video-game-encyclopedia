Collect the coins and get to the end as fast as possible to get the most amount of points.</p><p>Fun mechanics and animations and not to forget the difficulty make the game worth it's while.</p><p>Hint: Secure your keyboard and monitor in place before playing so you don't throw it out of the window!</p><p><strong>THIS IS A DEMO VERSION:</strong> If you played the game, please take a second to fill out <strong>this</strong> form!
