{"id": 857618, "slug": "tip-top-dont-fall", "name": "Tip Top: Don't fall!", "name_original": "Tip Top: Don't fall!", "description": "<p>Tip Top is an arcade style climbing game with procedurally generated routes that never repeat themselves!</p>\n<p>It features a gripping single player campaign that has you exploring all corners of the globe while making sure not to fall to your (perma)death.</p>\n<p>The player uses the innovative control scheme to move the characters hands from one hold to the next while making sure to be as efficient as possible. You only have a limited amount of stamina to use in order to reach the peak. If you run out of stamina or miss a hold you&#39;ll fall!</p>\n<p>But! The twist on the roguelike genre is that you never have to die. Careful players will try routes several times while clipping their rope to the wall before taking any risks. Skilled players will be those that find the right balance between risk and rationality and reach the peak in peace. Players that climb too carefully may never reach the top, as they\u2019ll waste too much energy clipping in to the bolts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-27T17:56:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32f/32f89f7635253b5884bdd7f13fd419d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series S/X"], "developers": ["Studio Huckepack"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Sometimes You"], "esrb_rating": null}
