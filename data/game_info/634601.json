ALL CONTENT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.</p>\n<p>You are an Interrobot, a robotic companion to the police in the dangerous, futuristic city of Celiss. Your job is to interrogate suspects, cut through the lies, and find the truth. This tech demo contains only the beginning and tutorial of the game. In the future, the full demo will contain a full case for you to play through.<br/></p>\n<p>Content warning: This game has mentions of violent crime and systematic corruption. Please don't play it if that is an issue!</p>\n<p>BTW: There is no music currently. Apologies!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This tech demo is mainly to check for balance in the tutorial and future cases. As I am a new creator, I want to make sure I'm on the right track with this demo. I'm not sure if it's too hard, too easy, etc.</p>\n<p>As such,\u00a0<strong>please </strong>send feedback! Send it here, email it to me at flimbingod@gmail.com, or at my Twitter @flimbingo. It will be a very great help. Thank you so much!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T07:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/659/659a7b7f8d904ddb39bab1e094c71938.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DFlimbingo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
