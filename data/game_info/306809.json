Within a simulated patient encounter, you will experience the short-term and long-term impact of your clinical choices.<br/><br/>This case is centered around a vice-president of sales, Steve Campbell, who needs help with his knee pain. In this clinical simulation, you will make choices as Mr. Campbell's primary care provider and experience outcomes based on the choices you make. You will be challenged to:</p>\n<p>~ Describe appropriate post-op or post-trauma opioid use.<br/>~ Make an appropriate exit strategy when starting patient opioid treatment.<br/>~\u00a0Assess patient pain history, treatment history, and pain condition.<br/>~\u00a0Determine if chronic opioid therapy should be continued.<br/>~ Assess for opioid use disorder or risk in a patient on chronic opioid therapy.<br/>~ Recognize a patient with complex pain and addiction needs beyond the scope of your practice and make an appropriate referral.<br/><br/>You will complete typical steps of a patient encounter and receive feedback after each step:\u00a0<br/><br/>~ Review medical record<br/>~ Complete an evaluation and treatment plan<br/>~ Make a plan of care for your patient<br/><br/>Feedback is color-coded to let you know whether you made the best selection, a less than ideal selection, or an incorrect selection. With the ability to retry a section or continue down paths to see impacts of different decisions, you will learn by doing without causing real-world negative outcomes.<br/><br/><strong>Who We Are:<br/></strong><br/>The <em>CE: PainTx</em>\u00a0suite of cases were developed by Clinical Tools, Inc. through a NIDA grant (\u00a0#1R44DA035042\u00a0).
