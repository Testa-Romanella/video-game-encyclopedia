Take control of two games at once and balance between defending your player and chaining together combos!</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Use mouse to move. Press the left/right mouse button to switch to controlling the left/right player. Bash into enemies to kill them and get points! Doing so will also take away a hit point. Switch back to a player to re-fill their hit points.\u00a0 Do this for as long as possible and see how high you can get your score!</p>\n<p>This game has been open sourced! You can check out the repo here. Also make sure to check out UniPlay, the open source\u00a0framework we used to make this game!</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d7/4d7ba88713c6d4842686c3126b0cc4b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Contigo Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
