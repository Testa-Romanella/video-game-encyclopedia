The overly crowded 405 Freeway was scheduled to be shut down for a full weekend due to a massive construction project. It was predicted that this road closure would bring the entire LA Metropolitan transportation system to its knees. The media organized a massive public information campaign and informed everyone living in Southern California that a 10 mile section of the freeway would be completely closed. As seen by the live aerial coverage of the closure almost everyone was off the 405 Freeway during this time. <br/><br/>However, you and your friends in a rush somehow avoided the thousands of hours of public notices and came upon a CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION sign. You and your friends ignored the sign and decided to take a shortcut through the once in a lifetime EMPTY 405 Freeway. <br/><br/>RACING GAME FEATURES: <br/>-23 different vehicles- sports cars and even buses <br/>-Career mode to earn money and purchase new vehicles <br/>-Fully upgradeable cars <br/>-Realistic car physics with drifting and traction control <br/>-Multiple race modes- Typical Race, Duel, and Elimination <br/>-Game Center Leaderboards <br/>-In App Purchases available to quickly upgrade cars <br/><br/>For More Information Visit: emersonapps.com <br/>Please Rate for updates with more tracks", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c6/2c6cea12ab8ff6c33985a7247a0f79a1.jpeg", "website": "http://emersonapps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Emerson App Development"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Sandee Emerson"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
