I had a lot of fun making this though, and it was definitely more challenging than the previous one. Someday, I might release a game that takes over 24 hours to make. Who knows? Anyways, I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Most of the programming on the balloons was made by my friend GabeD. Look for his games, he is very talented.\u00a0http://gabed3.com/index.html</p>\n<p>To anyone interested:<br/>If you have anything you'd like to change about this, be it art or gameplay tweaks, I would love it if you contacted me. I can share the game files with you and will publish any changes made to this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb1/fb14b4688dc212af6fa883225e905ff0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GLanna98"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
