Hold \"Left Click\" to aim, which slows down time to allow precision shots, and release to throw your shield. It will continue to bounce until you hold \"Right Click\" to start recalling back to you.</p>\n<p>There are 5 levels, with a lot of different room types, enemies, and other mechanics. Really short game overall, couldn't take most people more than 30 minutes. It gets pretty crazy towards the end.</p>\n<p>This is my 2nd game dev project and I think its pretty cool, there isn't any sound/music yet.</p>\n<p>By Ranveer Dhaliwal</p>\n<p>@rannystacks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dd/7dd06430f5392bbb522734d8fea9a706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rannystacks"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
