Once the game is run it'll automatically load up these tracks sequentially as you begin to cruise. If you want to play another song, simply stop cruising and begin again to \"skip\" that track!\u200b", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/fad8eb813940d4bf61f8f3416fb43745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mars Ashton"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mars Ashton"], "esrb_rating": null}
