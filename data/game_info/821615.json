The casino is set to close for a scheduled maintenance in 20 minutes and the customers are not happy about it at all so they cumulatively decide to go ape**** on you. After all, you can't go to hell twice!\u00a0\u00a0Throw dice at the enemies to deal damage and pick up their essence to level up. Exit the game if you die, there is a bug that doesn't reset the timer.</p>\n\n<p>Note. Don't expect a high quality game from my first jam :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T09:59:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64cd3879b625ed666591354fa8e1fcfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squiggle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
