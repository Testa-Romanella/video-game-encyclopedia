This is my first attempt at a game - try it out - its just a bit of fun for me to do during lockdown!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe inention of this game is to complete a time-trial challenge where you try to improve your time without dropping of the edge.  The blocks represent obstacles a wheelchair user like me has to get around.  I got this idea from going to airports on my various travels.  If you like it do play again and again to improve your time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThank you very much........", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T12:33:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9f/f9fad1514d1aeacd619bfb52d51b3154.jpg", "website": "https://wijsoftware.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William Jones"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["William Jones"], "esrb_rating": null}
