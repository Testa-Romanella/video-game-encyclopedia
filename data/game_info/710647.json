This game is designed for 2 players. This game could be played both in physical deck and on digital side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, we made a lot of changes from the Original Waite Tarot cards, and designed our own deck, as well as the whole new battle rules. Each player chooses from the two characters, either the Sun or the Moon, as their profile, and begins battle by randomly drawing 5 minor Arcana from the deck. In our game, the two players against each other need to solve the restrain cycle between different elements and calculate their hand points in order to find the right strategy to attack their opponents.</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:26:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e86/e86607b1bfbf70a0074c586a8cd0b2b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["meemeemy", "jasmine0204", "percysimms", "Emily Xie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
