Your typical postmodern blues.<h3>THE STORY</h3>Six months ago, Cole Fisher was fired from his job as a computer engineer at Cosmic X, a corporation devoted to the betterment of the human race, the pursuit of world peace and eventual space conquest. The reason? He found out what they\u2019re really up to. It\u2019s quite obvious, you know: they\u2019re trying to take over the world.<br/><br/><br/>Since then, Cole has been holed up in his apartment hacking his way through endless labyrinthine connections, gathering as much data as he can to expose the biggest conspiracy in human history.<br/><br/>And now, Cole has had a surreal vision, a religious experience, a close encounter, call it what you like. A Mysterious Messenger has told him it\u2019s time to act and bring down Cosmic X once and for all. Or at least that\u2019s his take on it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T08:22:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eed/eedfd6e7370cee0efc12be9e3b360142.jpg", "website": "http://www.orbistertiusgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Orbis Tertius Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Orbis Tertius Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
