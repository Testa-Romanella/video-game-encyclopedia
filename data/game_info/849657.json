Throw luck or misfortune at them, so that their luck-strike doesn't stop. But also, don't make them too happy either, otherwise they will cash out and you will go broke. The clue? You don't know either what will come up next. How long will your casino last?</p>\n<p>Before we started working on our prototypes, we had the opportunity to visit a casino and to learn about how gambling games\u00a0and the casino business work in general. We also got to know a person, that works with people suffering from gambling addiction. With all these impressions, four different teams with people from three different schools and each different specializations\u00a0started to work on their own interpretation of what \"gambling\" is.</p>\n\n\r\nOur Team\r\n\n<p>Yasemin Koyuncu - Art (HSLU Animation)</p>\n<p>Finn Meisner - Art &amp; Animation\u00a0(HSLU Animation)</p>\n<p>Jan Klingner - Art Direction\u00a0(Filmakademie BW, Interactive Media)<br/></p>\n<p>Leonhard Holzenburg - Coding\u00a0(ZHdK Game Design)<br/></p>\n\r\nInstall Instructions\r\n<p>Unzip the folder, then run the .exe inside the folder that shipped with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T06:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dca/dca55e3ce16fde4e19697bf8b506ff45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lholzen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
