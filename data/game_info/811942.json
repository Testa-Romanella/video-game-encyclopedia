Additionally if you happen to not have your player spawn on the screen try the restart button in the upper right hand corner. Finally the main menu is bugged so quitting on the download does'nt work &amp; finally if you try and start the game after the initial loading of the menu it will not work <br/></p>\n<p>You have to wait for the scene to be generated, then pick a side that looks strategically the best! But don't die, as you are the commander and you must survive. Move with WASD and turn with the arrow keys shoot with space! There is light support for Controllers in game play which is recommended, top triggers to shoot, sticks to turn and shoot. Best of luck to you!</p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T14:58:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc92f62e0c02402dcdea22225cc8e043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["trixy devs"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
