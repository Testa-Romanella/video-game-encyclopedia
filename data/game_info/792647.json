With the help of an overseeing robot and your time-shifting power, it's your job to figure your way out of the lab.\u00a0But just what was being done here? And why were you abandoned, along with the whole building?<br/><br/><em>Out of Touch</em>\u00a0was created for the\u00a0one-week Global MoonJam held in May 2022. The theme was \"time\". While the game itself was produced within the week time-frame, a plethora of free models, textures, sounds, and music were used.\u00a0 We really hope you enjoy this demo and would love to hear any kind of feedback!<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Extra mode revealed\u00a0at the end of the game!</strong></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A/D - movement ( left and right)</p>\n<p>W- Jump</p>\n<p>S- Crouch</p>\n<p>E - Interact with buttons</p>\n<p>F- Time Shift</p>\n<p>ESC- Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T14:52:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b90/b90b739dc42940b4967101be82116efd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Arcadia Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
