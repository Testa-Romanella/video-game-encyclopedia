Welcome to\u00a0<strong>Not Happy Wheels</strong>! a game that may seem to be Happy Wheels, but I can assure you <strong>it is not real</strong>.</p>\n<p>Controls are the same as the original but you can also view them in the character select menu.</p>\n<p>I made most of this game solo but my friend, <strong>Reispfannenfresser</strong>, helped out by creating a couple of levels. Huge thanks to him.</p>\n<p><em>if you play this Not Happy Wheels 5 game more than five times, you will be more and more involved, why the game is so addictive we will not discuss.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T08:08:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c7/2c7f0540e3f54997271824563a6e1de2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Starboi hooch"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
