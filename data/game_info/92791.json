An extra ship will be awarded at 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 points. The mission will be over if all of your ships are destroyed or you run out of fuel.\r\nGood luck, pilot!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nGame by\r\n\t<strong>kometbomb</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nMusic and sound effects by\r\n\t<strong>n00bstar</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAdditional graphics and pixel mentoring by\r\n\t<strong>iLkKe</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae33a7d19d8f411969897398496c05ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["kometbomb"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
