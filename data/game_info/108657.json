If you play well Bunny will dance and her fans will cheer for her, bur if you miss a beat she will trip and be sad. </p><p>You don't want to make Bunny cry, do you? Then practice and <strong>HIT THE BEATS</strong>! Aim for a huge score to unlock the <em>secret costume</em> for Bunny!</p><p>The game uses the <strong>QWER</strong> keys, plus the<strong> SPACE BAR</strong> to pause the game/skip the intro.</p><p>If you have any kind of feedback, please tell me. I'm aware that in some points the beatmap doesn't perfectly match the song but I've struggled a lot to get it to where it is now.
