Through her Valkyrie magic, Brunhild is able to transform into her two familiars, taking on the form of either a horse or a raven, which grants her special abilities. After killing a certain number of mortals and deciding whether or not they shall enter Valhalla, Brunhild is forcefully summoned there herself. In Valhalla she faces off against various gods, one each summon, until she finally gets to fight Wotan himself.<br/>Made by:</p>\n<ul><li>Danny Esser [Design]danielaesser@outlook.de</li><li> Chadane Francis [Art]chadanefrancis@yahoo.co.uk</li><li>Liz K\u00e4semann [Art | Project Lead] liz.kaesemann@gmail.com</li><li>Ilia Kuznetsov [Programming Lead ] ilya.kuznetsov3816@gmail.com</li><li> Noa Marcon[Design | Project Lead]noamarcon04@gmail.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T06:41:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3cd505ec030084893794d80087365c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Haakurei"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
