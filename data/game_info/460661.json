As the choppers fly over and the parachutes fill the sky all you can do is fire as many bullets as you can, but pay attention, each shot will cost you one point. Plan your shots and use the explosions to take out other helicopters and troopers. Once a trooper has landed on the ground they are relatively safe from your bullets, but with careful aim you can take them out using another paratrooper.\u00a0 Once you have four trooper on either side of you, its game over.</p>\n<p>This game is a quick remake of an old 8 bit game of the same name. This is a game written for a Udemy course on making a game in Unity. I added a title screen and start button to make it easy to replay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T02:47:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/660ef441ebcffad100bfef9eec10c22f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MGD MillsGameDev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
