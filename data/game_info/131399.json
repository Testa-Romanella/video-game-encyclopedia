Today, in the digital age, we rely heavily on technology to remember for us. We use the internet to support and extend our memory, everything lives on the cloud. The unchangeable nature of digitally stored data is considered to be more dependable than any other method. 1998 is a project that relies on a computer's memory to store past events of my life. In this VR interactive experience, you are teleported to spaces that hold some of my most prominent memories. One of them for example is of my favorite stuffed dog, another of a bonfire. The user journeys through the different memories and if they interact with certain objects, they are teleported between spaces. The whole experience is meant to explore time and space in memory capsules that leak into one another creating an unusual narrative that is intended to gives the user a sense of nostalgia.  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d9/7d9678f045bc200df802e5b951d85d5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["faryalhussain"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
