Starring a little red man named Anton - Boiler City\u2019s top exterminator - Antonball Deluxe Lite quite literally turns the breakout genre on its head, blending traditional brick-breaking gameplay with tight, intense platforming. Antonball Deluxe Lite features a free lite sampling of stages from Antonball Deluxe.<br/><br/>\"Working on Antonball Deluxe has been a dream come true for the studio. Personally, I'm very excited to be working with Proponent toward the goal of making it acceptable for everyone to play with their balls,\u201d says Tony Grayson, Studio Head at Summitsphere.<br/><br/>Antonball Deluxe Lite includes three separate modes:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>ANTONBALL</strong> is an enhanced low-definition remake of Summitsphere\u2019s legendary game jam title! After a long night on the town, <strong>Anton</strong>, Boiler City's resident exterminator and overconsumer of fizzy libation, is struggling to find his way back home from Brulo's Casino. Using his trusty Antonball, Anton decides to take the most direct path home after an unfortunate trip into the sewers: breaking straight through every single wall between the sewers and the city he calls home in 3 stages of brick-smashing fun!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>PUNCHBALL</strong> is the tale of Anton's building-mate <strong>Annie</strong>, and her indefatigable need to be the absolute best. When Annie discovers the Punchball Tourney being held at Brulo's Casino, with the grand prize being a lifetime supply of Ballble Tea, she sets out to win first place! You'll need to help her defeat all of the trickster beasts that have volunteered to take part in Brulo's wild game. Use the Punchball to slam enemies, then kick 'em off the stage! Do you have what it takes to be the Punchball Champion?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>VS. ANTONBALL</strong> is Antonball but competitive! Each team has their own brick wall and aims to break the other team's wall first. Defeat the other team by destroying their wall! Play 1v1, 2v2, or even 2v1 (if you're into that)! Many power-ups are in play, with some twists and turns depending on which arena you're having your ball-based blitz in! You can even pick some up and throw them!<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul> <li>Brick-breakin', ball-bustin' gameplay with a platformin' twist!<br/> </li><li>Includes THREE games: Antonball Lite, Punchball Lite, and VS.
