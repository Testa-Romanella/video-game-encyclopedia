Whoever adds the breaking bird loses and gets zero points for the round.</p>\n<p>Each bird you place will gain you points, and later birds will get you even more points as the tension on the wire grows. Listen for when the wire is about to break, you don't want to be the loser who ruins it for everyone do you?</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<ul><li>Only one controller needed! Pass it between players!</li><li>Select how many players you want.</li><li>Use left-right on the controller to select a spot to place your bird (the closer to the middle the more points!).</li><li>Press confirm\u00a0 to place a bird.</li><li>After 10 birds are placed, putting birds in the middle gains you much more points than ones on the outside.</li><li>IMPORTANT:\u00a0Putting birds in the middle weighs A LOT more than birds on the outside.</li><li>When there is too much weight on the wire, the wire breaks, you don't want to be the one to break it!</li><li>Select New Round to continue with the same points from the last round!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMjc0MzUxLzEzMjgxNTQucG5n/original/k09ZSK.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheGRS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
