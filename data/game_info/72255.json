The old farmer lives in a charming and slightly enchanted village with his animal friends Mr. Piggy, Mr. Baa-lamb, Madam Frog, Miss Turkey, Moo the Cow and Monsieur Bunny. They jump on the old cart to depart on the big adventure ahead, through the gardenscapes, forests and acres of fertile land surrounding his ranch.<br />\nTheir journey will lead them through the fascinating village and country around the charmed farm. Along the way they have to collect the apples, waterdrops, carrots, leafs, feathers and stars. But they encounter many more unexpected challenges! Will you help them and become the Farm King?<br />\nMATCH TO COLLECT<br />\nSwap items to line up 3 or more to match and collect them. Matching 4 or 5 items will result in various beams of magic fairy dust to spread over the level which will charm the items and double their value! These beams will also increase the value of previously charmed (highlighted) items and collect them at triple value.<br />\nTHE CHALLENGES AHEAD<br />\nThere are many tasks that need to be accomplished along the way. Grow the sunflowers and free the birds, help the bees collect honey and grow mushrooms. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Doesn\u2019t matter, on our farm we have both! Match the eggs to hatch them and match the chicks to bring them home. No surprise, grandpa Joe also really likes fishing! Feed the caterpillars so they become beautiful butterflies and collect the jam pots for your winter stock. Also clean the garden from dirt and stones while you&#39;re at it. Further ahead you have to fight the snails and spiders (and their nasty webs), fill up the barrels and help fireflies out of a trap! If you travel even further you&#39;ll encounter more challenges that are yet to be discovered.<br />\nPETS AT THE RESCUE<br />\nGrandpa&#39;s favourite farm pet friends travel along to help him out. They each have a special ability: they can charm one type of item when they have enough energy. This will be a tremendous help, so they&#39;re the heroes of this story!<br />\nThere are also some amazing boosters available to help you through the harder levels. Receive some help from outer space and call for a UFO to harvest one type of item. More down to earth is your stock of highly explosive pumpkins. For more precision work, you can use your trusty slingshot to shoot acorns.<br />\nYOU WILL LOVE FARM CHARM!<br />\nYou&#39;ll have an absolute blast with this relaxing casual match 3 puzzle game!
