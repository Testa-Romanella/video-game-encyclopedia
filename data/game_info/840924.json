What will you sacrifice for love? Can you trust your own heart?<br/><br/>Noblesse Oblige: a Cr\u00e8me de la Cr\u00e8me Adventure is a 137,000-word interactive Gothic romance novella by Hannah Powell-Smith, a standalone story in the Cr\u00e8me de la Cr\u00e8me universe. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br/><br/>On a windswept island, far from the mild shores of Westerlin, stands the estate that is your new home. You have been hired to work as a conversation partner for a lonely aristocrat. It is a profitable opportunity, and your impoverished upbringing and middling university education leave you few others. <br/><br/>But secrets lurk in every darkened corridor, and nothing is what it seems. Why does your young charge go wandering in the middle of the night, haunted and mourning? What is in the letters that the charming new secretary constantly writes? Why is your employer so intent on keeping outsiders from prying into the family\u2019s business?<br/><br/>Attend grand balls, ride through fast-paced fox hunts, spend jovial evenings with the servants, teach diligent lessons to your charge, and observe - or take part in - this northern land\u2019s religious rituals. Meanwhile, there are webs of deceit for you to unravel, and deep mysteries to explore. When you reach the end, will you bring justice to those who deserve it, or keep their secrets buried forever? <br/><br/>And, of course, there is love: midnight trysts, stolen moments, and sweet warmth amid the cold.
