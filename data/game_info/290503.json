Find your way using four elusive perspectives that expose and conceal your surroundings. Overcome the unexplained, reveal hidden curiosities and secrets within.  </p>\n<p><em>WORLD4 </em>is inspired by walkers like <em>Proteus</em> and <em>Gone Home</em>, asking what draws us in to explore and make sense of ambiguous worlds? It has been described by players as a puzzle that is explored but not solved.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Play alone or with others using four displays.<br/></p>\n<p>WSAD to move, mouse to look, ESC to quit.<br/></p>\n<p>\n<br/></p>\n<p><em>WORLD4 </em>is a work in progress, part experiment and part research project. You can support ongoing development by leaving a comment or sharing.</p>\n<p>If you like it, ping me on Twitter @alexandermuscat.<br/></p>\n<p>The multi-display build is still experimental and I only demo it on occasion.
