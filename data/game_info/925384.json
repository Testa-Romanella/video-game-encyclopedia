You can only remember the tiles that you can see around you; if you move away from an area and move back, you may notice that the passageways have changed.</p>\n\n<p>Click (and hold) to shoot. 1/2/3 to switch weapons. Place down torches (by pressing E) to remember a small area around the torch. Watch out though, as the passageway leading to the torch could also be forgotten.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was written in Rust and using the Bevy game engine. There are also a couple of experiments written in Python that you can check out in the <strong>demos</strong> directory.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Generation<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The dynamic world (re)generation is powered by a very simple cellular automaton which can seamlessly produce and regenerate cave-like structures. If you would like to see how it works, feel free to check out the Python scrips in the <strong>demos</strong> directory.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Development</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Kubin<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Rokcas<br/></strong></li><li><strong>spdskatr<br/></strong></li><li><strong>zeyonaut</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Testing</p>\n<ul><li><strong>memst</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Check out the GitHub for full list of contributors and attribution: https://github.com/jbachurski/tenebris<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T06:14:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4b/b4bd3496810001eae14c0f259c5fa52f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["spdskatr"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
