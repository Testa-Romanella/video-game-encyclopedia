I started off with three different levels, but I\u00a0wanted it to be a \"seamless\" transition between the three. Making it feel like a small journey from one end to the other.</p>\n<p>I practiced with such things like ProBuilder, lighting, and even animation.</p>\n<p>Things that are missing in this part of the development - Scripts for the moving platforms, a\u00a0\u00a0main menu, and when you get to the end after collecting the crystal, it does not do anything since there is no main menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This Project was created by - Zach Brooks</p>\n<p>And of course I would like to thank Michigian State University for help with assets and guidance, as well as Unity for the amazing asset store for prefabs like sand or trees.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T10:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e72/e7218ef9a7fb78b76e88ef8defdbf10d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Moxie_Brooks"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
