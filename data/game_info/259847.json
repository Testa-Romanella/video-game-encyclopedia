Each map requires you to make matches of specific gems to clear the map and move to the next one! The more you play, the more powers you will unlock and each will enhance your experience (pause the timer, destroy all white gems, show all combinations, etc.).<br/>\r\nOnly one class is available at start, but this class will evolve through the game and this evolution will grant you a powerful power specific to your class. With 20 levels, 6 classes  to master and 4 mini games, Gems Kingdom offers many hours of fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa7/fa7ed9433fdf931fa7c9bd2c57d6de6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ODBear Studios"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["ODBear Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
