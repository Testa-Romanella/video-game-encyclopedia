Game-play is smooth and resembles old-school isometric games, with some modern touches and HD graphics.</p><p>Twenty years ago, the zenos began invading terran colonies, leaving a trail of death and tears in their wake.  Terrans fought back, one planet at a time, while building a fleet to stab at the zeno home-world.</p><p>You arrive with that fleet, just after a massive space battle where all the supply ships have been destroyed.  You are left with a huge invasion army but no supplies to invade with other than one drop-pod and one pistol.</p><p>Good luck.</p><p>_______</p><p>With each soldier you send, you can collect new weapons and resources to rebuild your arsenal and improve the success of the next soldier's invasion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d50/d50e43598645c44dbee9c332d9830afa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquishyGamesCo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
