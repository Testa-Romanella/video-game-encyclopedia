Kill those enemies with no mercy and loot them to have some coins. You know how this works, you gave the money back and some magic happens to your bullets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But you don't want it to be that easy. You want to murder much more enemies, so just spend some gold circles to contract more enemies to die. But they're too weak, so make them stronger.</p>\n<p>LOOK OUT! You almost destroy the Castle. I mean, that's the main objective. But is kinda boring doin it right now. Add a few more bricks so it can resist some more bullets. Oh, there're also some construction workers who can restore the walls so you can continue destroying it. They'll do it\u00a0for a bit of money (always is for money, no one does it for the love of art).</p>\n<p>Oh, no. I mean, I said that you could upgrade your enemies, but not that much. Now they cross the red line (literally and\u00a0metaphorically). Now they gonna eat you and all your coins, it's the end. And how you're dead you can't make points, you died, you lost, that's common sense. I guess.</p>\n<p>But you have a last trick up your sleeve. A\u00a0 magic weapon. A tool descent for you from the gods. The all mighty saver. The reset button. So smash it with all your rage and go get the best score ever.</p>\n\n\n<p>This my first jam and the first game that i actually finish. I would like to put some more time in the art and some sound, but i'm really happy with how it came out.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for playing. I hope you like it. Have a nice day<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T18:28:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/432/4326ef62970c72d98c17a3b8ac326af2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dospo_01"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
