As there is no \r\nin-game chat, it is best to use a VOIP program like Discord or Skype to \r\ncommunicate. If you\u2019re looking for a server to either find team mates or\r\n talk with your existing crew; join the Wayward Ventures discord server!</p>\n<strong>Installation</strong>\n<ol><li>Download Wayward Ventures from the Downloads page on IndieDb</li><li>Extract the root folder to a destination of your choice</li><li>Run OceanProject.exe found in the root folder</li></ol>\n<strong>Hosting a game</strong>\n<p>To host a game, you\u2019ll need to either use a VPN tool like Hamachi, or\r\n forward ports 7777-7778 on your router. When you\u2019re ready; launch the \r\ngame and select Host Server from the menu</p>\n<strong>Joining a game</strong>\n<p>In order to join a game, you will need the IP of the game\u2019s server \r\nhost.

It \r\ncan be found at dock in the main central port players spawn at. <strong>It can be identified by its blue and yellow colour scheme.</strong></p>\n<p>The galleon has 5 sails; each sail contributes a set amount of speed to the ship\u2019s acceleration.</p>\n<p>The ship can be boarded from water level by interacting with the side ladders in-line with the ship\u2019s wheel.</p>\n<p>The ship\u2019s armament breaks down practically in to the following categories:</p>\r\nPORT SIDE\r\n<p>x4 Long Guns (Lower Gundeck)</p>\n<p>These have three ranges; short (pistol shot range) medium (musket shot range), and long (Beyond musket shot range)</p>\n<p>x2 Carronades (Upper Gundeck)</p>\n<p>These are short range guns designed to be used at point blank range</p>\n\r\nSTARBOARD SIDE\r\n<p>x4 Long Guns (Lower Gundeck)</p>\n<p>These have three ranges; short (pistol shot range) medium (musket shot range), and long (Beyond musket shot range)</p>\n<p>x2 Carronades (Upper Gundeck)</p>\n<p>These are short range guns designed to be used at point blank range</p>\n\r\nBOWCHASERS\r\n<p>x2 Long Guns (Bow)</p>\n<p>These have three ranges; short (pistol shot range) medium (musket shot range), and long (Beyond musket shot range)</p>\n<p>Bowchasers are used to fire at targets dead ahead of the ship.</p>\n<strong>Making Sail</strong>\n\n<p>Sailing your galleon requires learning how to make as well as take in sails. The galleon has 5 sails.</p>\n<p>To unfurl (or make) sail, the <strong>yardarms</strong> need to be \r\ninteracted with. This is best done with a player on either end, mashing \r\ntheir F keys until the bar is filled. However, a player can unfurl the \r\nsail alone by filling their interact bar on one end of the yard, and \r\nquickly crossing over to the other side to do the same. If this is done \r\nfast enough, a single player can unfurl the sail themselves.</p>\n<p>Once the sail is unfurled, it will need tying down, this is done by \r\ninteracting with the belay pins found on deck. These interactions are \r\ncarried out in the same way to the sails.</p>\n<p>To furl (reduce) a sail, this process is repeated in reverse.</p>\n<p>(Belay pins are seen in the screenshot below)</p>\n\n<strong>Naval Gunnery</strong>\n\n<p>Fighting hostile ships in Wayward Ventures first involves preparing \r\nthe guns aboard ship. To do this; each gun must be loaded with a powder \r\ncartridge and shot.</p>\n<p>Both cartridges and shot are found in boxes aboard the ship. \r\nInteracting with them will pick up either a single cartridge or shot;</p>\n<p>Once this is done, interacting with a gun will load it. A gun can be \r\nloaded with just a cartridge, but will only fire powder (no shot).</p>\n<p>To fire a gun, equip a <strong>slowmatch </strong>and left click the gun with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Once a gun is fired, smouldering debris is <br/>left behind from the powder and shot. This is indicated by a smoke trail<br/> emanating from the gun. If a fresh cartridge is loaded without cleaning<br/> the gun there is a chance it will detonate (this is bad!). To clean the<br/> gun, equip a sponge and mash left click on the gun until the smoke <br/>trail is no longer present.</p>\n<strong>Small Arms</strong>\n<p>Small arms are the means with which you will prosecute hostile NPCs and players. They consist of pistols, swords, and muskets.</p>\n<p>Swords are relatively simple; once selected they are equipped to the \r\nplayer and kept in their scabbard. Left clicking will draw the sword; \r\nFurther left clicking will attack with the sword.</p>\n<p>Right clicking will block with the sword. Blocking lasts a couple \r\nseconds during which you are unable to take further action; but any \r\nsword hits made against you will be parried. To sheath the sword simply \r\nequip it again.</p>\n<p>Pistols and muskets are loaded by holding the R button. Loading takes\r\n a long time and should generally not be attempted in battle. Once \r\nloaded, press the R button to cock or decock the gun\u2019s hammer. All \r\nfirearms must be cocked before they are fired.</p>\n<p>Lastly, all firearms are drawn facing up (for safety!) right click to toggle between pointing forwards and pointing upwards.</p>\n<strong>Useful Items</strong>\n<strong>Lifeline</strong>\n<p>These are a VERY IMPORTANT item! All players should carry at least \r\none lifeline with them at all times. Should you fall overboard whilst \r\nsailing, equip your lifeline and activate it with left click. Provided \r\nyou are still close, you will be returned to the ship</p>\n\n<strong>Telescope</strong>\n<p>This is extremely useful for navigation. There is always one found in the Captain\u2019s quarters</p>\n\n<strong>Compass</strong>\n<p>Equally useful for navigation but also essential for pursuing quests \r\nfrom NPCs that give bearings. Found in the Captain\u2019s quarters</p>\n<strong>Hats</strong>\n<p>Equip from the inventory with the F key. Press G outside of the inventory to drop it</p>\n<strong>Tea</strong>\n<p>Tea regenerates your life, equip and use with primary click to drink.</p>\n\n<strong>Factions</strong>\n<p>There are two main factions in the game with a third planned; The \r\nyellow faction (neutral) and the green faction (hostile). Not all ships \r\nadhere to these colour schemes though so be wary of their behaviour.</p>\n<strong>Quests &amp; NPCs</strong>\n<strong>Cargo shipping</strong>\n<p>Speak to this NPC found in the central town to ascertain the \r\ndirection of the nearest port. Sign their ledger to begin purchasing \r\ncargo. Each signature will spawn a cargo box next to the NPC. If these \r\nare brought to a shipping warehouse at another port they can be sold for\r\n profit.</p>\n\n<strong>Treasure Hunting</strong>\n<p>Speak to this NPC to begin a treasure hunt quest. Sometimes you will \r\nreceive the location of a clue or other NPC, sometimes you will receive a\r\n potential treasure location. You will need a compass to follow the \r\nbearings given.</p>\n<strong>Shipwright </strong>\n<p>Speak to this NPC to repair your ship</p>\n<strong>Bugs/Important Information</strong>\n<strong>Server Host Screen locks</strong>\n<p>There is a bug where the server hosts screen can lock frequently. \r\nThis can be quickly remedied by entering and exiting the inventory.</p>\r\nShip Damage readout\r\n\n<p>This is important for keeping track of the ship\u2019s health \u2013 it updates automatically</p>\r\nKeep the guns clean!\r\n<p>Repeatedly firing the ship\u2019s guns without cleaning them is dangerous;\r\n if a gun malfunctions it will explode and be irreparably lost.</p>\r\nDelegate Tasks!\r\n<p>It is very difficult to see to all tasks aboard ship yourself. It is \r\nalso a bad idea to just assume someone else will see to something. \r\nConsider electing a leader or assigning roles to crewmembers. Gunners, \r\nsail handlers, lookouts, helmsmen, etc.</p>\r\nArm yourself!\r\n<p>It is recommended that you carry a sword or pistol on your person at \r\nall times. The ship starts the game with a stocked armoury located \r\ntowards the front of the ship. (Forecastle)</p>\n<strong>Storms</strong>\n<p>Always have someone at the helm of your ship during a storm. They \r\nwill need to fight the wind as it pushes the ship around. If this isn\u2019t \r\ndone the ship will almost assuredly capsize.</p>\n<p><strong>Wind </strong>is not simulated in Wayward Ventures. Tacking to adjust for wind direction should not be taken in to consideration when sailing.</p>\r\nStopping the ship\r\n<p>As there is no working Capstan/Anchor system yet, the fastest way to \r\nbring the ship to an immediate halt is to untie all the sails.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/723/7236505e2038d9f34dd7250bed95d126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Subtractive Alchemy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
