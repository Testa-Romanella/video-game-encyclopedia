It took me about four months to make this\u00a0in my spare time. I've been making games as a hobby for over ten years, and I've started many projects but never ended up completely finishing them. My goal with this project was to spend only a few months on it and bring it to full completion, and I'm happy to say I\u00a0achieved that goal! It may not be a very impressive game, but I'm learning to finish my projects, and I'm\u00a0taking steps toward my next big idea.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a prototype of a bigger concept of mine, which is a first person re-imagining of classic fantasy beat-em-up games like Golden Axe and King of Dragons. These games were fun, easy to understand, and simple enough to enjoy even with a friend who didn't play games very often. I\u00a0hope to capture that feeling of sitting on the floor next to a friend, choosing the characters that suit your personalities, and going on a fun adventure together.</p>\n<p>I hope you like the idea and enjoy playing!</p>\n<p><em>Created by Christopher Ohanesian<br/></em><em>Music by Mark Ohanesian</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:41:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afbb7dda2acf74057087f99fbf415480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cohanesian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
