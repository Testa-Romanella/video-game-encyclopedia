I'm stealing some ideas from it for a new action game, but may revisit this prototype (and its odd control scheme) and add new enemy types at some point.<br/><br/>It's an action game played only with the mouse.<br/>Rounds are short and difficult.<br/>Avoid the enemies. Shoot the enemies.<br/>Follow the directions and you'll do just fine.<br/>Good luck.<br/><br/>Placeholder Music:<br/>https://seaofaland.bandcamp.com/album/morning-star...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/740/74033e63cac9c400e149db005fb1696e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["samuelesque"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
