Instead of 48 hours, I made a game in 10 hours. Within those 10 hours I encountered a LOOOT of problems which I may bring up in a Youtube video I may or may not create on the channel AwSomeone. I have made other games and videos, so check out my profile or yt-channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXEYAB_BcQXNcGiQewy5pog</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:26:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e3/4e32dd85b09d2d4526a01d9da0aa21e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aw_Someone"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
