You have told the captain of your theories but he tells you that his orders are specific and the ship cannot be stopped or turned around to allow you to go back to the planet. He orders you to attend to your duties and forget any ideas about jumping ship.</p>\n<p>You decide that you cannot rest until you have discovered what these \"keys\" are for and resolve to once again go it alone and disobey the captain's orders.
