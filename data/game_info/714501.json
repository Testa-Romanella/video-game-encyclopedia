While the mysterious stoat's treatment has bought some precious time, Liam and Sophia must now travel the rest of the way to Redwall Abbey for a more permanent cure. This is the dramatic conclusion of their journey through the murk of Portman's Slough, the miraculously-functioning puzzles of Grating Gulley, and the ancient ruins of the Otters' Den.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>A brand new original story set the winter before the events of the first book.<br/></li><li>A stunning woodland world inhabited by charming critters and villainous vermin. <br/></li><li>Two characters with divergent dialog for replayability.<br/></li><li>Unique real-time scent mechanic fitting for woodlanders who experience the world primarily through their noses.<br/></li><li>An assortment of achievements and collectables for the completionist spirit. <br/></li><li>Original soundtrack created especially for fans of Redwall.<br/></li><li>Fully voice acted by a talented cast of new and established actors.<br/></li><li>Engaging puzzles and side stories for those who delight in world building.<br/></li><li>Full controller support with multiple schemes to choose from. </li></ul><h3>Mechanics</h3><ul><li>\"The Scout: Act 3\" completes the growing list of scent-based skills by introducing a new rot indicator used to identify the age of scents.
