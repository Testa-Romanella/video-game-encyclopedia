Yes, we all do.</p>\n<p>So did Garry, who accompanied his father when he just wanted to buy cigarettes. From the first moment he was completely enchanted by these crackling Magic -\u00a0boosters in which the color of his eyes was reflected. The moment he firstly opened a pack he was like spellbound by the artworks\u2026 the style\u2026 the smell. At his age every boy was dreaming of girls - he dreamed of cards. Classmates were curious about partys - he were curious about the upcoming card set\u2026</p>\n<p>It was his personal love. He spent every buck and second into his deck and eventually started playing at his local stores. He defeated everyone easily. Soon he began to destroy the regional qualifies but for him\u2026 this wasn\u2019t enough. Garry had to show everyone that this was more than a game - it was his passion. From there on he had to show everyone his love for this game. So his main purpose in life became playing Magic everyday\u2026 because it\u2019s his everyday's magic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T10:24:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74cc00eacc6175032222f429d5fb7781.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["boesh", "Capscreen", "memoryleak47", "aloc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
