{"id": 543324, "slug": "late-knight", "name": "Late Knight", "name_original": "Late Knight", "description": "<p>I started developing a RTS game for mobile that is going to be very similar to clasic games like Age of Empires (mostly)\u00a0in terms of mechanics. In the same time since it needs to be adapted to mobile there is a lot of space for experimenting and inventing scenarios/mechanics/rules. Game is in full development so errors can happen.</p>\n\n<p>And so the idea here is for anyone who would like to play the game in this early stages and help in finding the fun'est' version that we can have for the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also have a job so progress with this one will be slow, but I currently enjoy working at it so there will be some activity in any case. Also starting this kind of discord servers \u00a0or facebook, as in the following links, that bring more people to it, keep me motivated as well</p>\n\n<p>I should also post here some tutorials, but for now .. you can keep in mind that that the game is based on finger HOLD(longer HOLD)/TAP.
