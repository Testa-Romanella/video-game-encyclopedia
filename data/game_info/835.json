{"id": 835, "slug": "volgarr-the-viking", "name": "Volgarr the Viking", "name_original": "Volgarr the Viking", "description": "<p>Volgarr the Viking is a 2D action-platformer inspired by classic platformers such as Ghosts \u2018n Goblins and Rastan. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game follows a Viking named Volgarr summoned by Odin to defeat an evil dragon. The gameplay shares many similarities with old-school side-scrollers.<br />\nThe game consists of six main worlds and one secret level. Each of the world except the final one, divided into two part: an open area referred to as \u2018level\u2019 and a \u2018temple\u2019 with a boss on the end of it. On every stage, you have to go from the beginning to finish slaying monsters on your way and picking up treasures and power-ups. Volgarr has two weapons: throwing the spear and a sword. Throwing spear can be charged, and if it hits the wall, it serves as a platform that allows player achieve secret places. Additionally, Volgarr can pick up Mjolnir\u2019s Blessing, a power-up that kills all non-boss enemies on the screen upon taking a hit. The hero has several different moves to fight the enemies and getting through platforming sequences such as jumping slash, crouching slash and down thrust. <br />\nThe player can collect treasures scattered throughout the levels. Most of them only affect the player\u2019s points. However, picking up particular Life Fires gives the player access to particular Valkyrie levels \u2013 alternate versions on game world with different layouts and more challenging enemies. The amount of Life Fires player collected affects the number of lives they have to beat Valkyrie level. Completing all of them in a single playthrough unlock a secret level Yggdrasill where Volgarr has to defeat the last boss in the game - Nidhogg.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2013-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-19T12:28:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/2184086b78ff972f35855d72a3f186d1.jpg", "website": "http://www.volgarrtheviking.com", "rating": 3.28, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 50, "owned": 1092, "beaten": 19, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 62, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 70, "ratings_count": 106, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 109, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Wii U", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Crazy Viking Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Adult Swim Games", "Crazy Viking Studios", "Crazy Viking"], "esrb_rating": null}
