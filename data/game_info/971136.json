Discover new planets, assign them planet-wide projects, and watch as trains miraculously ferry the fruits of their labor around... through space! Discover strange planets and unlock their secrets. Research technologies that range from silly to literally game-winning, sometimes both. Different every time! Robust train reaction based scoring system for people who are way too into this.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's goofy, it's low-pressure, it feels like having your brain squished through a strainer, it has enough of a \"One More Turn\" effect that it's been seriously difficult to get feedback on the last two thirds of the game because all the play testers are too engrossed to provide any actual feedback.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T06:00:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/897450aadb8676336980d36aad419903.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Noisy Owl"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Noisy Owl"], "esrb_rating": null}
