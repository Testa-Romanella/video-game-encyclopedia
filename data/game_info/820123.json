Defeat your opponent by manipulating the dice with quantum physics.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p><p><strong>How to play</strong></p><p>You can remove your opponent's Dice by selecting it then a Dice of yours with greater value. You can even use more Dice if the sum of their values is greater.</p><p>QuantumDice go to superposition if they are not visible and get a new value when they become visible again. In the shady hidden area your opponent can't see them so try blinking.</p><p>QuantumDice can have quantum entanglement between them. The value of an entangled dice is the value on the opposite side of it's pair's value.</p><p>Click on an ActionDice to make a special action. Try them all out! Other than not having a value, they behave as other Dice.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Created for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 in 48 hours.
