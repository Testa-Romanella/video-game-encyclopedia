Your starting village is trying to gather resources and find new places to expand.</p>\n<p>Your sole task is to place new tetrominos so that your villagers can access more resources and thus expand to new plains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal is to grow your population as big as possible. The catch - placing new tetrominos will cover existing resource fields or plains. No resources can be gathered from covered fields and already existing villages will be crushed.</p>\n<p>Place your given tetrominos wisely, so your village can prosper.</p>\n<p><strong>Fields:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Plain</strong><br/><br/>\u00a0A field for creating new villages<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Food</strong><br/><br/>Your villagers need food.
