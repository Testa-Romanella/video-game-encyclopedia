It is a sequel to the game Smuggler&#39;s Run. Like the first game the player is a smuggler trying to deliver illegal cargo to destinations within 3 large maps in the game using several different types of vehicles to make deliveries in a given amount of time. A GameCube version was released in 2002 titled Smuggler&#39;s Run: Warzones.<br />\nThe game was originally supposed to take place in Afghanistan but following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan, the developers changed the Afghanistan levels to the deserts of Georgia, Soviet/Russia instead.<br />\nUnlike the original game, Smuggler&#39;s Run 2: Hostile Territory did not become a Sony Greatest Hit.<br />\nThis was most likely due to the difficulty of the game. As in the first one, the police can drive the same cars but with much greater max speeds, the ability to go faster, slower and turn in mid air to land on the player off jumps, extreme acceleration, and being outnumbered and taken out easy. Along with very inflexible time limits, leaving no room for mistakes.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2001-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T16:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0fc/0fcc4d0bdb3bd4389b08bc31aa5e2322.jpg", "website": "https://www.rockstargames.com/games/info/smugglersrun2", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "GameCube"], "developers": ["Rockstar San Diego", "Angel Studios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Rockstar Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
