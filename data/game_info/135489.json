You shall dominate the sector and gain control over this part of the universe.</p>\n<p>This game is a small project made by only one person in about three months. All the assets, sounds and music in the game has been made by myself. I hope any amount of people will like it, as it is a rather peculiar game. You are in control of a nucleus and a cloud of electrons. You must harvest resources to expand your cloud and become stronger to defeat the evil Anti-Particles.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Quick Guide:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move your core (Blue) around with <strong>WASD<br/></strong></li><li>Use the <strong>mouse</strong> to move your electrons (Cyan) around</li><li>Keep the <strong>left mouse button</strong> pressed to increase entropy within your cloud</li><li>Move your electrons into matter (Purple, Green and Yellow) to harvest</li><li>Kill the anti-cores (Red) with your electrons</li><li>Destroy the mother-anti-core to progress</li></ul>\n<p>The general idea of the game was to be a rather simple game with simple mechanics, but challenging with those mechanics. With the way the game works, it means being better that the Anti-particles at maneuvering your electrons to smash your cloud in their cores. <br/></p>\n<p>The game is in English and French, free to play and distribute. It is the same with the soundtrack, feel free to share and remix it if you please.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck making the Universe<em>, and have fun!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59b/59b5940c672fc2d6b3e54342b4e1af99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["doublewookiee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
