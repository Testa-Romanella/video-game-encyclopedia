{"id": 91315, "slug": "yume-nikki-3d", "name": "Yume Nikki 3D", "name_original": "Yume Nikki 3D", "description": "<p>Yume Nikki 3d<strong> </strong>is a fan game based on<strong> </strong><strong>Yume Nikki</strong> universe (if you haven't played the original Yume Nikki, I highly recommend it). The game is not a simple 3d remake, but rather a spin-off to the original, with lots of extra content. Instead of using RPG Maker, I used an old 3d engine from the 90's. </p><p>The package also includes <strong>Isolated DLC</strong>. Only play this DLC after you've completed the main game.<br/></p><p>Note that <strong>it's not necessary to be a fan of the original game</strong> to enjoy YN3D. The concept is understandable and it's easy to pick up and play. </p><p>You play as a little girl Madotsuki. The game starts in your room. You can use the bed to enter the dream world or desk to save your game. The bed can transport you into a dream world where the majority of the game takes place, and your task is to find six \"effects\" and three keys in this world. Some of the effects are requied to progress in few areas of the game. The most important effects, such as bicycle and the knife, are hidden in the locations connected to Nexus (the hub location). Most locations in Dream world are connected by series of portals and there's no boundaries. You are free to explore the game world.</p><p>Uboa event video<br/></p><p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong> </p><p>WASD - move<br/> Space - jump<br/> E - use, open, pick up<br/> Shift - use effect<br/> Enter - menu<br/> F12 - take a screenshot </p><p><strong><em>Credits:</em></strong> </p><p>Yume Nikki 3d is made by <strong>Zykov Eddy</strong><br/> Zykov Eddy's site: http://eddyprojects.blogspot.ru/ </p><p>Yume Nikki is made by <strong>Kikiyama</strong><br/> Kikiyama's site: http://www3.nns.ne.jp/pri/tk-mto/ </p><p>Eduke 32 is made by Eduke 32 team<br/> Eduke 32 site: http://eduke32.com/ </p><p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aa336f373053e6084fd14552c70e828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zykoveddy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
