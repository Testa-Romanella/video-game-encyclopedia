Monitor your energy once you have recharged the fruit by pressing \"q\". If your energy is very low, you won't jump. <strong>Hit, jump and eat. Simple and frenetic!</strong></li><li>You can jump very high between branches by holding the jump button \"space\". The longer you press the higher you get.</li></ul>\n<p>Sounds too simple? Well, try the different difficulty modes on settings menu that we have prepared for more experienced players</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T07:07:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec3/ec39d1627e4bc4ab5ea2dd63f3b6c574.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JavierStark", "Jos\u00e9 Recinos", "Nospa", "vicen_92"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
