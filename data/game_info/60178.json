Guilty or not, you find yourself trapped in the middle of strange events involving a demonic possession and divine apparitions. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Each time you remember the boy or hear about being accused of murder, you go into a trance fueled by fear. These moments of madness depict gore, repulsion towards God, and sometimes even the voice of the devil himself trying to convince you of things that may or may not be lies...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gray Dawn takes place around the year 1920,  in a remote village in England. Throughout the game, you will often be transported to the beautiful world of Romania, which is inspired by the mysticism of Eastern Europe.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-10T21:11:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f6/1f698c752488c11f4a5efab8448c731f.jpg", "website": "http://gray-dawn.com", "rating": 3.54, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 26, "owned": 237, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 33, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 37, "suggestions_count": 517, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 37, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Interactive Stone"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Interactive Stone"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
