{"id": 364811, "slug": "the-eternal-cylinder", "name": "The Eternal Cylinder", "name_original": "The Eternal Cylinder", "description": "<p>In The Eternal Cylinder, players control a herd of adorable creatures called Trebhums and must explore a strange alien world filled with exotic lifeforms, surreal environments, and the constant threat of the Cylinder, a gargantuan rolling structure of ancient origin which crushes everything in its path. This unique ecosystem is a massive, procedurally generated land with unique animal AI, real-time world destruction, and organic exploration and puzzle design to create emergent gameplay that ensures no two playthroughs are ever the same.</p>\n<p>Your Trebhums begin at the bottom of the natural food chain but can mutate and evolve with new physical attributes and abilities by eating a variety of flora and fauna. Discover and adapt dozens of mutations, including new traversal skills like flying and swimming to reach new areas, and new senses to help overcome puzzles, challenges and dangers. Your many Trebhums can each have different mutations, and new mutations don\u2019t replace ones you already have, letting you stack ability sets in dynamic ways. Each mutation will also change the physical look of a Trebhum and stacking these will generate near countless surprising new creature designs which players will be able to organically discover as they explore this unique alien ecosystem.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T02:16:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6b6398deece575e85fae62e8c10cd10.jpg", "website": "https://www.eternalcylinder.com/", "rating": 3.42, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 21, "owned": 70, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 41, "dropped": 11, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 24, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 24, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["ACE Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Good Shepherd Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
