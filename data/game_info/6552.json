At first I thought it would be easy to play, but after about five levels, I realized it would take a lot more skill. The graphics are great, with an excellent parallax background effect, but it&amp;#39;s the intentionality behind the level design that really gets me excited. I definitely recommend.&amp;quot; - by rainmaker101<br/><br/>5/5 - &amp;quot;I really love this game. It looks amazing and the gameplay is fun and challenging.
