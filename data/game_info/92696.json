We actually spent the first 12 hours of the gamejam discussing the topic (and sleeping over it).<br/>You will find, we handle the topic on a meta-level. If you can't figure it out yourself, try beating all the levels... maybe there is a hidden explanation somewhere.<br/></p>\n<p>We also integated this topic on another level: The stories you get to read in the book are about a giant stealing the badly cooked stew of a group of gnome soldiers, who did not have the correct ingredients for their traditional recipe. The giant liked this stew so much that it ended an ongoing war with an amazing symbiosis between the two races.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a3/9a3d43106e30d1fabb488d402ffa6998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vhite Rabbit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
