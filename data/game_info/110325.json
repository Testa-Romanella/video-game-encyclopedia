It uses public domain paintings by early 20th-century Lithuanian painter Mikalojus Konstantinas \u010ciurlionis for the handful of pictures. The story, such as it is, is loosely based on a dream I might have had, and some of the text is transcribed directly from my dreams. Some of the sounds are field recordings, others are sounds I created.<br/></p>\n<p>I was like 12 the last time I tried to make a game, and I\u2019m not used to publicly sharing things I write, so I welcome any feedback about any aspect of this thing. I rushed the production of this a bit to submit it for the Self-Care Game Jam 2 - thank you to j hayley and the other participants for inspiring me to try making a game! This rush means the interface is a bit sloppy, and there\u2019s no character art. Maybe I\u2019ll add some sort of character art later, though maybe it\u2019s better like this where you have to imagine the characters. Either way, I will probably make a revised version at some point to do some text revisions and make the interface and visuals cleaner.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd1/bd123ce4a8a830c8b474572c3fbe3dd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["carrie z"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
