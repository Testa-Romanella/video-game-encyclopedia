Due to school progress may be slow.</p>\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>The gameplay is fast pace but the time to kill\u00a0is somewhat slow (~1500ms). The reason for this is that I think most frustration from games like Call of Duty is the fast ttk as the player doesn't have enough time to react in some scenarios which may feel unfair. As for guns I can't promise\u00a0much that is why I've decided not give them their\u00a0own point but I'll try\u00a0to make the guns as unique as possible instead of feeling repetitive, with\u00a0different stats, models and animations.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nAdvanced AI:\u00a0\r\n<p>Because most FPS focus on multiplayer the AI is bound to be poor and feel either very bad or artificial. My goal is to make the AI as human as possible, I want the player\u00a0feel like their playing with actual people. However with that comes the element of frustration if the enemy team is dominating you which brings us to the second feature.</p>\n\r\nDynamic AI Difficulty:\r\n<p>The main goal is to combine the advanced AI with a dynamic enemy difficulty. Not only do I want the difficulty to change at the start of the match but I want the difficulty change in real time.</p>\n\r\nKill Streaks:\r\n<p>I think the concept of killstreaks is interesting. But the problem with them is that they may feel unfair and unbalanced even if they're not.\u00a0However with the dynamic AI this <strong>SHOULD</strong> balance out.</p>\n\r\nStory:\r\n<p>Now here I can't guaranty much due to my lack of time and constantly feeling burned out from school and social interactions (Social Anxiety). However the story I envision is about two human factions in the future\u00a0fighting a conflict in a <strong>Simulation</strong> the hosts of the mentioned simulation is an\u00a0alien race. The whole plot is around the simulation itself. I also wanted the story to branch out so the player would\u00a0 be able to choose the path they want with their actions, but I don't know how that will work out.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Keyboard:<ul><li>Move (W, A, S, D)<br/>\n</li><li>Jump (Space)\r\n</li><li>Reload (R)\r\n</li><li>Slow-motion\u00a0(F1)\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Mouse<ul><li>Shoot (LMB)</li><li>Look (Mouse Movement)</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T05:50:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/06097fc909acb7579e6d049be207fc11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
