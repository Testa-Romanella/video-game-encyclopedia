OR be a nice kid and click and speak out sweet red words to make the enemy LOVE you!<br/>\u00a0 Use the mouse to left click on stance box to write down commands.<br/>REMEMBER: commands start with &gt;<br/>for eg: &gt;act, &gt;fight, etc<br/>every action which requires you to type in the bar needs to start with &gt;<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Basic information:</strong><br/>&gt;Fight<br/>during &gt;fight, you have to click on words, words which are violence related (kill, hurt,etc) which will hurt the enemy and cause them damage. While clicking on sweeter words (love, cuddle, etc) will not cause damage to the enemy, but will increase their LOVE towards you! Hurt words will cause damage to the enemy and eventually knocking them down unconscious. But fighting is not the only solution to end a battle.<br/></p>\n<p>&gt;Acting<br/>Acting is another way to handle enemies<strong> without fighting</strong> and can be accessed by &gt;act. Different act commands can be entered through the stance:acting bar. These acts help to increase your befriending chances essentially, after enough tries you can end battles peacefully by befriending the enemy through the &gt;befriend command.</p>\n<p>&gt;Inventory<br/>Inventory is where you have your items. Food and equip able. Food items can be consumed, or shared with the enemy. The enemy will take the item and appreciate this kind gesture, also increasing your chances of befriending enemies. To consume items, you need to give space and write consume beside them for eg: &gt;apple consume<br/>Similarly, to <strong>share items</strong> you have to add share beside, for eg: &gt;apple share.<br/>Be sure to give [space] between the two words for the command to work!</p>\n<p>This is just an experiment I worked on for 4 months using Scratch. This is my first game publishing on Itch.io\u00a0and it's not really a game, just a small experiment game.</p>\n<p>There might be a lot of bugs and issues I might have overlooked. Please forgive me for it.\u00a0 In order to restart, you might need to close and re-open the game (you can't press the green flag since this isn't Scratch,\u00a0 but I'll update it to bind it to a button in a later update)<br/></p>\n<p>The battles itself aren't really that hard, you can get over with them in a breeze since I really didn't care to increase difficulty.<br/></p>\n<p>there are 5\u00a0<strong>different ways of ending battles, but I won't spoil it for you, it's up to you to find them!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Credits:</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Soundeffects</strong> from Undertale, Earthbound and\u00a0Ace Attorney</p>\n<p><strong>Music </strong>from Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue: Trainer battle!</p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong>from Earthbound and google images search</p>\n<p><strong>Enemy - </strong>Default Scratch cat,\u00a0<strong>pixelized</strong></p>\n<p>Red spider lily from: https://www.deviantart.com/hunnibunnii/art/P-Red-Spider-Lily-Pixel-718399576<br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt;poop</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:14:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/002b3b34bf2188af8c42eda6f60f14c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dardudee"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
