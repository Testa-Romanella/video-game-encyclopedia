It's definitely a little rough around the edges but I'm still proud of what I accomplished alongside my teammates.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong><br/>It's 1922 and you have the honor of carrying the torch across the great metropolitan plane. As you're running, carelessly I might add, you trip and fall into a manhole that was left open by some lackadaisical construction workers. You're stuck, at the bottom of a reasonably sized sewer-system, infested with green slime boys and overflowing with water. You have only the waning light of your torch keeping you safe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have to traverse through the sewer, jumping from platform to platform, and from platform to ladder, and maybe even ladder to platform... Keep safe, and keep your torch out of the water.</p>\n<p>Keep the torch ALIVE!</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare (46)</p>\n<p><strong>Gallery:</strong></p>\n\r\nConsumed By The Drain\r\n\r\nWhat Lies Below<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Move Left - A<br/>Move Right - D<br/>Jump - Space<br/>Float (In Water) - Space<br/>Climb Ladder - W<br/>Aim Torch\u00a0 with your mouse<br/>Throw your torch by\u00a0either holding left-click for a second then releasing for maximum power, or just click for a weak throw.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong><br/>Unity<br/>Visual Studio 2019<br/>FL Studio<br/>Audacity<br/>Piskel</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Programming: Or1beau<br/>Visuals: Tipika<br/>A Single Sound: Mo<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T08:00:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/875/875465b9650321af18e44df4606da66b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Or1beau"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
