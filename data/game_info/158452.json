There is no challenge involved, you can simply take a sip by tapping or just chug through your beer if you press and hold. A UI in the HUD fills up as you keep drinking, it slowly reduces after you stop. It is supposed to indicate a level of intoxication but it currently does nothing even if it fills up.<br/><br/>I currently have no solid plans to build a game around this but that would be exciting at some point.</p>\n<p>Design: Varun Raj K</p>\n<p>Art: Varun Raj K (made using GraphicsGale)</p>\n<p>Code: Varun Raj K<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44b/44b4f22f555e16d4dfde81a83b92b0ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["varunraj"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
