{"id": 441678, "slug": "zenith-junction-alpha-build", "name": "Zenith Junction (ALPHA BUILD)", "name_original": "Zenith Junction (ALPHA BUILD)", "description": "<p>Zenith Junciton is a digital deck-building RPG where players use tiny sets of cards to defeat massive foes. Zenith Junction takes deck-building strategy to the next level; not only do players craft their decks both in and outside of battle, but each turn they split their cards into three \"engines,\" making the best possible combination to outsmart the enemy. Zenith Junction bridges the gap between tabletop and digital card games- and does it all on top of a runaway train.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This is an alpha version! This game is in an early stage- assets are not final!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T09:07:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93c/93ceee0e8fc8a72112823c3d84a0e6af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dnelk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
