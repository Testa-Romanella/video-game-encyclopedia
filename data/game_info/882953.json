Thanks to the powerful function of Godot Engine, we can now present both financially and spiritually free level editor to you! With the powerful editor, you may create astonishing effects for your chart and share your level with other players!<br/><br/>Note: the Level editor and Steam Workshop function will be released in the future.<br/><br/>Have suggestions?
