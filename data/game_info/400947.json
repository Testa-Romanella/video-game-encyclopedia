I'm not an influencer or even an extrovert, but I thought whether it be dying for the vine or killing time I knew I didn't want to be alone. So, I opened up Facebook live and streamed for the very first time. To stay calm I joked about making a VR game about my experiences and two years later I found myself in a class called CTAN 504 Virtual Reality Production where I was able make good on that two year old promise. An interdepartmental collaboration with Thorton School of Music, John. C. Hench Animation Division, and the Interactive Entertainment and Games Division.</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Steven Harmon \u2013 Developer<br/>Isaac Mailach &amp; Sterling (Michael) Maffe \u2013 Composers<br/>Bethany Lai &amp; Leon Cruz \u2013 Mocap Tech Assistants<br/>Eric Hanson &amp; John Brennan \u2013 Faculty Advisors</p><p>Presskit available here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T02:15:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd7/bd7987603428049b7547e2c1254a5d6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["StevenHarmonGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
