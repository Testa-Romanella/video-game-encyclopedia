I was way to ambitious with it, and after almost 3 years of off and on attempts to finish just a demo, I'm calling it quits on this.<br/>Still, I think there is a lot to look at and learn from this project. Take a look, draw inspiration or get ideas for your own game.<br/><br/><strong>Plot<br/></strong>You play as the new person in town. Finally able to move into your new \"affordable\" apartment, only to have it bought by the richest man in the city, Mr. Rich. With the rent now unreasonably high you must do whatever you can to make ends meat and pay your rent.<br/><br/>This game was made in <strong>RPGmaker VX ACE<br/></strong><br/>:Art, Programming, Writing:<br/>WeirdRikert\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twitter<br/><br/>:Music:<br/>Yung Bean \u00a0 \u00a0 SoundCloud<br/><br/>:Dialogue (the ones with personality):<br/>Peter Logan \u00a0 \u00a0Twitter<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T05:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fbaac54b3e5cb0882bfbad5dad64460f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WeirdRikert"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
