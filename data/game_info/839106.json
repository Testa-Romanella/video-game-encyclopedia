{"id": 839106, "slug": "spacetime-dimension", "name": "Spacetime Dimension", "name_original": "Spacetime Dimension", "description": "Spacetime Dimension is a physics simulator based on NVIDIA engine in Unity3D, Players can build a chaotic system and observe its fantastic trajectory, observe the interaction and gravitational potential energy of planets, place an infinite number of dominoes and connect any number of space triangles.<br/><br/>You can explore an endless range of the world. The terrain is generated by waveform superposition without repetition. You can freely explore the ocean, islands, mountains, and even the solar system, set the direction and speed of the emitter, and place and launch objects.<br/><br/>Build with Joints or Springs and simulate the motion of single, double and multiple pendulums in accordance with Newtonian physics in the real world, or connect objects in arbitrary places such as triangles, triangular pyramids in 3D space, cubes, bridges, buildings, etc. Structures, even the strongest bridges and building solutions can be determined based on how much they bend under increased loads to facilitate construction and presentation in the real world at a true scale.<br/><br/>Soul Journey of Time and Space: You can travel freely in the universe and create your own planets, star systems, etc. You can also observe the gravitational potential energy of celestial bodies and how they bend the surrounding space.with God Mode, and you can simulate collisions between celestial bodies at will. Based on Newtonian mechanics, the motion of planets can be simulated in the infinite environment with gravity/without gravity, which is in line with science and physics, just drag and hold the planet, then gently toss it, and quietly watch the N-body evolution of stars, planets and moons.<br/><br/>You can throw objects, connect objects using springs and sticks and watch chaotic system's fantasy trails,You can build propulsion, clips, or mechanical instruments, or build 1m long, 1/4 or 1/16 long blocks in game, the camera uses a high display range, no matter how far the object is from us From afar, we can all see them.<br/><br/>Simulation capabilities of Spacetime Dimension<h3>Geometry</h3>Build triangular pyramids, cubes, and easily build any complex geometry.<br/><h3>Mechanical</h3>Use springs and ropes to build mechanical instruments, catapult systems.<br/><h3>Astronomical</h3>Simulate gravity, true planetary proportions, and celestial interactions. It also allows you to feel the vastness and magnificence of the universe, the basis for the formation of the solar system.<br/><h3>Domino</h3>Use dominoes, ropes, balls, and blocks to combine to build a domino system of any size.<br/><h3>Chaos</h3>Build double pendulums or arbitrary pendulums, drag celestial bodies to create N-body motion.<h3>Physics</h3>Control objects to observe the motion of pendulums, spheres, and blocks in gravitational and non-gravity environments.<h3>Architecture</h3>Build bridges, frames and perform dynamic simulations of physics.<h3>What has been done so far</h3>Sky Ball, Ground, Player,Pick Up &amp; Throw, Gravity, Inventory, Launcher, endless terrain, ocean, planet impact,  Planet, Sun, Halo, Dominoes, Billiards, Spring, light,teleport,Delete Function, Music, Springs with Multiple Stiffness Coefficients,Wooden Ball, Ramp, Block, Airplane Mode, Exit Menu, Exit the game,    fixed perspective when opening the bar, mini-block, pick up optimization, pick up an item, 3d text, icon, spring connection, pendulum connection, scene construction, text and other functions.<br/><h3>Some features and improvements we would like to add</h3>Archive function, more celestial bodies, terrain editing, multi-language, coloring function, Fixed Joint And Lope, Electric Charges and Molecules,Light Awareness, Missions and Goals, Location Markers, Thrusters, etc.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T03:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e48/e48a492a35b50463082d39734b5c0900.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GraphPhysical"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GraphPhysical"], "esrb_rating": null}
