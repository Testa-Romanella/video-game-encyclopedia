The game controls like an RTS, but unlike traditional RTS games, each cat will have needs and desires outside of performing the player's every whim.\u00a0Players will need to take into account the cats'\u00a0 hunger, sleepiness, and desire to just sit back and relax. \u00a0Miserable cats will desert camp, causing a drop in\u00a0population and productivity.<br/></p><p>Catadel is still in the early Alpha/Preproduction phase, so expect unfinished art, unfinished sound design, features\u00a0that need polish,\u00a0and bugs that need to be fixed.
