But be careful as each attack has a different shape, range and accuracy, and each enemy moves around you accordingly to be hard to hit!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Defeat your enemies, earn points and enter the battle against the chief of their army! You can cast three different colors: blue, red and yellow; and by combining two of them you use three more colors: purple, orange and green.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Move around with the arrow keys/left stick, and cast colors with X,Y,B/1,2,3 (use a Xbox controller for a better experience).<br/></p><p>Link to the Global Game Jam page:\u00a0https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/color-mess.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/66457daca4f4075c99078881fb2ba03f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Thomas Rodriguez"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
