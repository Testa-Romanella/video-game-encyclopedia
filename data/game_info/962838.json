{"id": 962838, "slug": "bdsm-apocalypse", "name": "BDSM Apocalypse", "name_original": "BDSM Apocalypse", "description": "You play as a mercenary in a world full of zombies and haywire killbots built to destroy them but also target humans. There are a few safe zones, and that is where the survivors gather in various settlements and groups. Even the so-called safe zones are only relatively safe, the undead roam in hordes, and the killbots border the area ready to kill anyone that gets in their zone. To make things worse, raiders and warlords constantly fight for control over supplies and territories, and you are just one mercenary trying to make a living.<br/><br/>The game also features heroines that you can court, but given the harsh environment, the inhabitants have developed certain kinks, particularly in BDSM. You can play as either a sub or a dom, depending on your preference and choices in game.<br/><br/>The game's combat system is CTB (Conditional Turn Base) with low number stats that easy to keep track of and allows for fast-paced combat with little to no grinding. The world's currency runs on ammunition (amms), which you also need for your guns, so you will have to be careful on how you spend them. There are plenty of things to spend your amms on, from prostitutes, food, drinks, mods for your guns, supplies, etc. each with their own advantages.<br/><br/>But that's not all, you can largely even avoid combat through stealth or by assassinating targets with back stabs, avoiding the battles all together, though certain exceptions exist. Shooting a gun is the fastest way to kill your enemies, but gunshots can also attract hordes to spawn in your area, so it's often more prudent to use a knife even in combat... but that all depends on the situation.<br/><br/>The game also contains dozens of animated sex scenes with sound.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T03:27:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ef/1ef735ced850755e93bd2a06fe348e72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noxurtica"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Noxurtica"], "esrb_rating": null}
