{"id": 868731, "slug": "pspickr", "name": "PSPickr", "name_original": "PSPickr", "description": "<p>A simple color picking game originally made by Sean M. Tracey, re-created on PSP with slight changes. The game has two modes, one with a timer and one without. The timer is the green bar (which eventually turns red) at the bottom of the screen. The player has 5 lives and the achievement is to get the highest score possible which is saved on the device. The one thing that makes this different from Sean M. Tracey's game is that it has a deliberate glitch, where if the user does not guess correctly for over 5 seconds the boxes will disappear for a second. Don't get me wrong, this is not a glitch, its a feature!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T10:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/18339b29c87a0caac8c9e5131ccf976f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joel16dev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
