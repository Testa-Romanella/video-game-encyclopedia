It\u2019s Tetris, but every once in a while you are asked to sacrifice a tile\u2026 hence the name \u2018Tetrifice.\u2019 This was honestly just a fun exercise for me to make Tetris. It is a very powerful Tetris engine that I am super proud of, you can perform lots of high level piece rotations, so have fun if you are in to that sort of thing. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/9402e0026832ef527b0c4427e12c1f8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["johnnyturbo"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
