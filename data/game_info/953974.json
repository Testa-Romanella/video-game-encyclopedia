{"id": 953974, "slug": "ashcrown", "name": "Ashcrown", "name_original": "Ashcrown", "description": "The once prosperous kingdom of Coela is now fragmented. Ravaged by war and chaos, its now splintered regions drift further apart, giving birth to new ways of life. This land torn apart, though, is also plagued by those who deal in nefarious ways. The people need a hero such as yourself to guard the roads long left at the mercy of the wicked.<br/><br/>Be it for fortune or justice, will you heed the call and restore glory to the Ashcrown?<br/><br/>Ashcrown is a turn-based PvP game that\u2019ll test your strategic mettle. Combining the champion-based gameplay of MOBAs with the depth of strategy games like chess, every decision you make will determine if you\u2019ll achieve glorious victory or crushing defeat.<h3>Recruit Your Army</h3>From a wide selection of 50+ champions, each with their own abilities and spells, you\u2019ll choose three to take into battle. Each turn, you\u2019ll be faced with hard choices. Focus fire on a specific enemy champion or spread the damage? Use buffs to amplify your next turn or lay waste to your foes as quickly as possible? These questions are but the tip of the depth iceberg of Ashcrown\u2019s combat.<h3>Outsmart Your Opponent</h3>Cutting your teeth in this free-to-play multiplayer game is as easy as it gets. There are no advantages or pay-to-win gimmicks. Players compete on an even playing field with nothing but their own tactical prowess to guide them. It all starts with Normal mode where the stakes are low but the learning is infinite. You can go with a Blind pick queue and dive in head-first. Or, you can work on your drafting skills in Draft, which utilizes a picks and bans system.<br/><br/>This will prepare you for the ultimate challenge of Ranked where your mettle will be tested and rated through a comprehensive ELO system.
