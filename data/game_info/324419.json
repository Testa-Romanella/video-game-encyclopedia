It is believed that the person was murdered, but no body was found. <br/><br/>You are aided by your special memory gloves. When the gloves make contact with a bare forehead, you are gifted with a snapshot of the persons memory. Convince the carnival attendees to expose their foreheads and unlock the secrets to the century old mystery!<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the JamDNA #16 within 96 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>W,A,S,D </strong>to move the main character around.</li><li><strong>Scroll wheel </strong>is used to switch between items in your hands, you must hover over the specific hand to switch items in that hand.</li><li><strong>Left Mouse Button </strong>uses the equipped item, in the left hand, on whatever you have clicked on.</li><li><strong>Right Mouse Button </strong>uses the equipped item, in the right hand, on whatever you have clicked on.</li><li><strong>i Button </strong>is used to open and close the detective menu - the <strong>ESCAPE Key</strong> can also close this menu.</li><li>You can quit the game mid play by accessing the detective menu and pressing the\u00a0<strong>EXIT GAME </strong>button in the bottom right corner of the book.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game Jam Criteria:\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Atmospheric</strong><ul><li>I have tried to convey a ghostly atmosphere in the game. Instead of transitioning between scenes, when the player approaches something that they can interact with, a ghostly image of the object appears before them, getting more clear as they get closer. Everything is varying levels of transparency and all characters have a creepy vibe to them through the art style. All of this helps to add towards the atmosphere of the game. The game is also a blend between an exploration and a point and click.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Carnival</strong><ul><li>The game is set inside of a carnival, there is a carnival monkey, clowns, strongmen, old time freak-show members, carnival games etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Wasi</strong><ul><li>The main character can acquire snapshots of people's memories by slapping them on the bare forehead\u00a0-\u00a0that's\u00a0one\u00a0strong\u00a0slap! </li></ul></li><li><strong>Eerie Music<br/></strong><ul><li>The game features creepy carnival music - which has an eerie vibe. As the game progresses, the pitch of the music shifts to make it even more eerie.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Follow me for gamedev stuff on Twitter over at: https://twitter.com/RobThomasWhite\r\n</p>\n<p>or on Instagram at: https://www.instagram.com/robwhitedeveloper/\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS / DISCLAIMER (The assets listed below were not created by me, everything else was):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>One public\u00a0domain\u00a0music\u00a0track (main theme song):</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html<br/>\"Tenebrous Brothers Carnival - Act One\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p><strong>One\u00a0rain\u00a0sound\u00a0effect, licenced under Creative Commons 0:</strong></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/director89/sounds/265627/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T03:48:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/514/514d23d3e6dd7cced87e9dbf1515e285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Robert White"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
