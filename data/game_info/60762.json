{"id": 60762, "slug": "orphan-age", "name": "Orphan Age", "name_original": "Orphan Age", "description": "Orphan Age is a <strong>life-sim game</strong> where you <strong>look after a band of orphans</strong> in a <strong>cyberpunk warzone</strong>.<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of an unforgiving, <strong>neon-lit dystopian warzone</strong>, your only battle is the fight for survival, scraping out a living in the face of extreme danger. You will <strong>guide a band of orphans</strong>, each with their own skills, emotions, strengths, weaknesses and fears, through a <strong>dangerous and ever-changing city</strong> in a bitter struggle for survival. Constantly <strong>balancing risk and reward</strong>, you must make the big decisions to <strong>ensure the group stays alive</strong>. <strong>Build</strong> up your base, <strong>scavenge</strong>, <strong>craft</strong> and <strong>explore</strong> the city for new recruits, whilst ensuring there are enough supplies to <strong>keep going</strong>, even when it seems <strong>all hope might be lost</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Orphan Age plays as a single player campaign with a lot of replayability inspired by the 4X genre. But there\u2019s a twist! 4X stands for <strong>Exploration</strong>, <strong>Exploitation</strong>, <strong>Expansion</strong> and <strong>Extermination</strong>. In Orphan Age, we replace Extermination with <strong>Empathy</strong>, bending the 4X genre into a 4E.<br/><br/><br/>The city of Orphan Age is ever-changing and procedural. You won't find the same building twice. There are <strong>high risks and high rewards</strong> when you <strong>explore</strong>. You can find <strong>rare resources</strong>, <strong>Orphans to recruit</strong>, but you can also get wounded or worse...<br/><br/>Exploration is similar to the expeditions of Fallout Shelter: procedural text adventures. They offer more complexity though, because you have to make decisive choices while you're out of the orphanage.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Hundreds of resources</strong> are left to be scavenged in the Orphanage or in the city. They are classified in <strong>6 categories</strong> that allow you to eat, drink, take care of wounds and to craft the items and resources you need to build your Orphanage. <br/><br/><br/>The Orphanage is the place your Orphans call home. The <strong>environment</strong> surrounding the Orphans greatly affects their moods. Try to keep the rooms lit, warm, furnished and clean for the happiness of all!  <br/><br/>There are <strong>38 different items of furniture to build</strong> (beds, playgrounds, science mats, campfire, heaters...) and each one can be <strong>upgraded</strong>.  <br/><br/><strong>Research</strong> allows you to discover better furniture and improve living conditions for the orphans.<br/><br/><br/>Orphan Age is a<strong> deep micro-simulation</strong> making each Orphan unique in personality and in gameplay. The Orphans have <strong>different ages, set of skills, backgrounds and personality traits</strong>. Depending on who they are and how well they are, the Orphans will take <strong>different paths</strong> anytime there is an issue to be discussed.<br/><br/><br/>INFO:<br/><ul><li>Available in Early Access this winter<br/></li><li>For PC, Mac &amp; Linux<br/></li><li>Comes with a companion visual novel Orphan Age: Diaries<br/></li><li>Music composed by Makeup And Vanity Set</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23b/23bb95870a1b7812ac4e98056f7893cd.jpg", "website": "http://orphan-age.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 383, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Black Flag"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Studio Black Flag"], "esrb_rating": null}
