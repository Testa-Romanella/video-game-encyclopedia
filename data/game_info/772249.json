If so this game was inspired by that - and that I had a day free when I was on my trip and wanted to make an Easter themed game. So here it is, I hope you can all enjoy it. If enough of you ask for it I will release the game on Android, in the google play store. I haven't done now because Easter will be over by the time it gets verified.</p>\n<p>I would explain the controls but there isn't much too them but here they are anyway:</p>\n<ul><li>Click the egg with the mouse</li><li>Press Escape to open/close the shop</li></ul>\n<p>That's it.</p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy Playing</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><em>If you'd like some updates or the android version\u00a0leave a comment. Ill try my best, feel free to check out my other games as well :)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T11:56:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f12/f12991e0cc0034bb7505512873c6e303.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nutty Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
