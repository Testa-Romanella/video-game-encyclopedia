Originally inspired by the NES classic Black Bass. We'll see if we end up fishing!</p>\n<p>First take on the Dragon Ruby Toolkit. Pretty sweet!</p><p>Feature progression:</p>\n<ul><li>A boat!</li><li>Map goes vroom!</li><li>Wall says bang!</li><li>Music makes splash!</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Now the boat spins!</li><li>And there's things to catch!</li><li>And BIG BOYS under certain conditions!</li></ul><ul><li>There's a fishing pole, and the fish target is now where the lure would be, \u00a0as opposed to directly under the boat\r\n</li><li>Boss fish are more exciting to catch. Still looking to filling out fish with sprites rather than blocks\r\n</li><li>The boat has a separate collision map for each direction, giving a better feeling experience.\r\n</li><li>The map is now separated into a collision map, and a decorations layer. This means you can float over certain riffraff and drive behind trees (okay, it's actually in _front_ of at this moment heh)\r\n</li><li>The map decorations are filled out. Though, you can't see most of the detail at this resolution from the boat ; ;\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>...
