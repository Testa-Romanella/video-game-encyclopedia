On the Endless Night, a magical occurrence that happens once in a millenia, Nimbus wants to create a potion to grant Lady Wrenfell immortality, too, so she will never have to die again.</p><p>You can:<br/>- Find the\u00a0\u00a0seeds to grow the\u00a0potion ingredients<br/>- Plant and harvest them to create the Potion to Restore the Soul<br/>- Check how far along the plants are after you've planted them<br/>- Interact with other animals in the garden</p>\n<p>I created, wrote, designed, and programmed the\u00a0game\u00a0 in RPGMaker MV using assets from some incredible creators.
