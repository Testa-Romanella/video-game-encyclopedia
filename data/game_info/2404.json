It takes a deep understanding of your own weight, thrust, and inertia in order to be a master Particle Mace gladiator, but once you get in the zone, this game satisfies like no other.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPARTICLE MACE is a game about capturing the thrill of classic arcade games with a new, physics based mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPARTICLE MACE is a game about trying not to die, but that's impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPARTICLE MACE is explosive arcade fun for 1-4 players that pays homage to twitch games of the past, but replaces the typical guns with an unruly physics-based weapon. Take control of a tiny ship in an extremely hostile universe, and defend yourself as long as possible from enemy ships and asteroids using a collection of trash particles tethered to the ship. To survive, you must carefully navigate around the many hazards while building up momentum to swing your weapon into your foes or your friends, all in a field of brightly abstracted visuals and an entrancing procedural background. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures: <br/>\r\n\u25a0 150 Missions<br/>\r\n\u25a0 1-4 Player Local Coop<br/>\r\n\u25a0 9 Ships to Unlock <br/>\r\n\u25a0 2-4 Player Deathmatch <br/>\r\n\u25a0 2-4 Player Arcade Co-op <br/>\r\n\u25a0 Leaderboards <br/>\r\n\u25a0 PS3, PS4, Xbox One &amp; Xbox 360 Controller Support <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame by Andy Wallace <br/>\r\nMusic by Nathaniel Chambers <br/>\r\nAudio by K.
