Beat the game to unlock hard mode where you can revert the game to its pre-nerf difficulty.</p>\n<p>The code is open source in spirit of the competition but by no means a contender for Cleanest Bevy Code.

The logistics of making that work seemed too hard to do quickly\u00a0so I\u00a0pivoted to \"Mario Party but your opponent cheats.\" Seemed easy to do, just make the AI have some clear advantage in the mini games, always have good rolls, and maybe have a trump card up his sleeve.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:08:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d3/9d3fb5d62c92cd58b0a5e5b3c3c6cee1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jabuwu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
