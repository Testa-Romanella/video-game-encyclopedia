The more you have, the worst it\u00a0is.\u00a0Try to see how much treasure you can loot and beat your friends to it on the leaderboard!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move: wasd</li><li>shoot: left click</li><li>reload: r</li><li>machine gun: 1</li><li>shotgun: 2</li></ul>\n<p>Enter the Tomb and loot as much as you can on coffers and mummies you kill. The more treasure you have the further the mummies will hear you and come after you. Also beware of the traps!</p>\n<p>When you find the staircase down you have a choice. You can go back to the surface to \u201cget some rest\u201d, this will save your score and heal you. Or you can \u201ccontinue\u201d to the next depth and will get a loot bonus for doing several levels in a row but beware as monster and loot become more numerous and dangerous with depth.</p>\n<p>On the surface you can use the money you just looted to improve your equipment and skills at the store. Don\u2019t worry, the score is saved before you spend money so you don\u2019t loose score. You can only use what you just looted (not your whole score) and it will be set back to 0 when you go back in the tomb. So you better loot as much as you can before going back to buy a lot of upgrades! When you go back in the tomb, you will go back to the depth at which you were last, but any bonus will be rested.</p>\n<p>Death is definitive and you will be prompted for you name to add to the leaderboard at that point.</p>\n<p>Hope you like our game!</p>\n<p><strong>You can play on the web here!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Devs:<br/>- Guillaume<br/>- Minimata<br/>- Sebastien<br/>- Yukaword (John)<br/>- Yann<br/>- Citarox<br/>- Romane Donnet<br/>- Dan Bourquin</p>\n<p>Art:<br/>- Cyndesign (J.H)<br/>- Aminata<br/>- Swan Keller<br/>- Charline Saucy</p>\n<p>Music &amp; Fx:<br/>- Cyril</p>\n<p>Game Design:<br/>- Alexis Giard</p>\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to Oniroforge for hosting the gamejam in Fribourg.</em></p>\n<p>PS: there was never a first game, but we are greedy so we start directly with the second.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de9/de997a2de6d9b225ae40a7e0f94226ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["VadeMetro", "AlexisGea", "piller.yann", "sebdegraff"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
