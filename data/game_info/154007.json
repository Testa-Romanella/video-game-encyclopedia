{"id": 154007, "slug": "quest-for-fire", "name": "Quest for Fire", "name_original": "Quest for Fire", "description": "<p><strong>Quest for Fire</strong> is a side-scrolling, retro style beat-em-up, heavily inspired by arcade games of this\u00a0genre from the early '90 like <em>Streets of Rage</em> and <em>Cadillacs and Dinosaurs</em>.</p>\n<p>In this game You get to play one of two characters, each one with a unique combat style and gameplay feel. You will travel a randomized  level, avoid traps and defeating waves of hostile lizard-man to find a new source of fire and bring it back to the safety of your own camp. Just don't take too long - the sun is slowly   setting and it's getting dark, without the fire You will find it very difficult to spot traps and enemies.</p>\n<p>Although the game can be beaten in about half an hour (depending on difficulty), it has high replay value thanks to the randomized levels, multiple characters, 4 difficulty setting and its high score tracking system. It's easy to play, but hard to master.</p>\n<p>The game uses the Panda3D engine and was originally made for a PyWeek game jam. It has been significantly improved since then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All funds (minus the itch.io share) raised by this game will be used to develop further, more ambitious games. Thanks for Your support!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea0c71baa5889133c73f020c1bf9b95d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wezu"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
