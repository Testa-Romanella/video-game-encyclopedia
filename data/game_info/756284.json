To achieve this, she chooses to lead the slaves to rebellion, then to overthrow the system and establish parity.</p>\n<p>The player has to fight enemies in turn by turn. Before fighting them, he must first get information from the NPCs by talking to them to find out the weaknesses of the enemies, but be careful, there are honest and lying NPCs. Once this information is gathered, the player can attack the enemy based on the information previously obtained by the NPCs. There is also an exploration part where the player can find equipment and evolve.</p>\n<p><strong>The team :</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Game Designers</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Producer :</strong> Kilyan Fernandez</p>\n<p><strong>Programmers :</strong> Cl\u00e9ment Catorc</p>\n<p><strong>https://clemca.itch.io/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>https://www.clementcatorc.com/</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Alexandre Mitranescu</p>\n<p><strong>https://org4nx.itch.io/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Level Designer :</strong>\u00a0Thibaud Bailly</p>\n<p><strong>Narrative Designer :</strong>\u00a0Lalo Messine</p>\n<p><strong>https://cailloudelariviere.itch.io/</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Game Artists</em></strong></p>\n<p>Hugo Mathieu / Nello Gotuey / Marie Dangr\u00e9aux</p>\n<p>Note : The game is only available in French.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T11:00:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70c642ecffb4bfba00a16e7b1bbd84a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ORG4NX"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
