Destroying her shrine in the process. She got angered so she contacted\u00a0Yukari about it, Yukari seems to be missing. And then Yukari came, holding a gun and a pickaxe in her hands. \"What's going on?\", \"Reimu, it seems like there's a disturbance in Gensokyo. Mysterious people started to show up in these portals.\", \"What can we do now?\"\r\nYukari held her at gunpoint \"I guess this is what outside worlders call it 'Battle Royale'.\" She starts shooting Reimu, Reimu escaped, realizing how the others are already affected by the Incident. Entitled \"Battle Royale Incident\", it caused all youkai and humans to kill each other till there's one left and return and repeat the cycle over and over. Reimu got angered by this so she started to explore thoroughly. In her exploration, she met a mysterious foundation that tasks to help on the culprit.\u00a0Same as she would do so.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA short Touhou script with guns, use these guns to speedkill your opponents.<br/><br/>\r\nUpdate\u00a0: Fixed a small bug when exiting, removing leftover assets<br/>Update 2 : Added Novice mode<br/><br/>\r\nFortnite is from\u00a0Epic\u00a0Games<br/>\u00a0Touhou is from Team Shanghai Alice\r\n<br/>\r\nArt, Boss, and Player\u00a0sprites made by me\r\n<br/>\r\nExpanded ZUN shotsheet by Ozzy/ExPorygon (v1.0)\r\n<br/>\r\nSFX is from\u00a0Touhou, Fortnite, Binding of Isaac\r\n<br/>\r\nFonts Used:\u00a0\r\n<strong>VCR OSD Mono</strong>\u00a0by\u00a0Riciery Leal<br/>\r\nVoya Nui Font is from\u00a0BIOMEDIA Project (Used for creating the jewelcase)<br/>https://www.makewordart.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Music is from Silvagunner:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3TyKfU3mR</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T10:46:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31b5b540daff610eec62729d0ab51b37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MakutaMatara"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
