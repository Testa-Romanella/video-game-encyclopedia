To do this, you must clean their poop, help them to reproduce and spoil them with dandelions!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Be careful not to let them die of disease or in sadness.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is playable only with the mouse and is a demo version of a more ambitious management game I am developing. Have a nice day.\r\n</p>\r\nGame rules:Click on the cows to select them and move them in your game environment.\u00a0\r\nYou will then see 3 bars of statistics:\r\nThe first bar is the remaining life of your cow, because it is inevitable, it will die one day. However, you can make sure that she dies having had a happy life and many children.\r\nThe second bar is the ability to reproduce. Bring your cow close to another cow with a full bar and you can make a small calf.\u00a0\r\nThe third bar is the happiness of your cow. If the cow is happy enough at the end of her life, she will bring you 200 coins instead of 100 if she loses her life.\u00a0\r\nHer happiness increases when you give her dandelions or when she has children.\u00a0\r\nBe careful, the happiness can drop suddenly if your cow gets sick.\u00a0\r\nTo avoid diseases, remove their poop and treat them before they contaminate others by using the care pens.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T07:01:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30e/30e2c6b70ee1336d3d7808e2214469ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PlantBasedStudio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
