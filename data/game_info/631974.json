Now you can get up close to the organisms and diverse flora that live inside the gut, and learn about the importance of fibre in maintaining this thriving ecosystem. <br/><br/>Just like any healthy ecosystem, a rise in the dominance of one or more species can upset the balance and affect its overall health. To educate people on the importance of this, Kellogg\u2019s created an immersive and educational VR experience called the Gut Bacteria Reef. Where viewers can travel into the gut in a virtual submarine to uncover the inner workings of the gut ecosystem for the very first time.<br/><br/>Let your gut dive instructor take you on an exciting journey inside the human gut, where you can learn all about the types of food and fibre that help healthy gut flora grow.<h3>Single Player</h3>Shrink down as you work your way through the hidden world of your gut ecosystem. You will need to pay attention to the schools of bacteria species that swim past if you want to sustain the Gut Bacteria Reef.<h3>Diverse Ecosystem</h3>Explore the living organisms that occupy the Gut Bacteria Reef (and your gut). A rise in the dominance of one or more species can upset the balance in either ecosystem and affect its overall health.<h3>Fibre Feeder</h3>Fibre helps the good bacteria to grow and thrive. Select the right mix of foods and fibre to load the fibre feeder, helping good bacteria multiply and overwhelm the bad bacteria.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T02:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be7/be721aa87727a4fdc939b9de5980aff1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NAKATOMI"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["KELLOGG"], "esrb_rating": null}
