This game started as a seven-day roguelike challenge where I tried to make a Stardew-like that would keep on changing. (Actual time before the first build was uploaded: 16 days. That's game dev for ya.)</p>\n<p>My twist on the Stardew formula is that some plants will affect their neighbors, either increasing or decreasing that crop's value. You'll have to change plans on the fly as new seeds and new plants become available.<br/></p>\n<p>All of the music, except for the title theme, has been stolen from my other games.
