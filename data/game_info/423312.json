All assets you see and hear are self-made; no assets from the asset store, no downloaded materials, the music is done with the google melody maker, all handcrafted by a German guy trying his best to make it look like a cute game.</p>\n<p>Font used: \"edirne\" by\u00a0 Iordanis Passas. Free for personal use.</p>\n<p>The theme of the game jam\u00a0was \"SOLIDARITY\". My interpretation is that we all need to play a role in slowing the spread of the corona virus through social distancing and other measures.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Can this game be any more fun? Yes, there are a million things on my to-do list, but some I could just not include because my skills in C# are still low. If you see anything that might be a feature, sorry to disappoint you, it is more likely a bug that I tried to hide :)</p>\n<p>Stay healthy and please give tips and tricks.<br/>Drop me a tweet: @420Misterg</p>\n<p>misterG, 29-03-2020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a56/a56c4f048efd12f9455173ac4c44fa28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["misterG420"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
