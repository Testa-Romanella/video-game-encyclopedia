Nothing makes sense here.\u00a0\u00a0There are many characters to meet and even more adversaries to fight. And fight them you must, in order to survive the threats of the deep blue sea.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is so beautiful here</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Turtle Simulator is a game designed to look like a Gameboy Color title in every way.\u00a0The ocean is a place of incredible beauty.\u00a0Is beauty an inherent property of certain things, or do we project beauty upon that which is physically ordered and pure in this world? Only investigation into the depths of this ocean world will yield answers.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Confront hard decisions</strong></p>\n<p>In this game, you must confront existential dilemmas. Are you willing to fulfill the destiny that nature has preordained for you? You may not like the answers that you seek in your quest to find your turtle kind.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move.
