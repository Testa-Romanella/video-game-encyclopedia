Lexa, an unusually mischievous student, is one of the player's peers. Lexa has a bad habit of conjuring creatures from all manner of dimensions...and not putting them back. The Headmistress tasks the player with banishing whatever Lexa summoned back to where it came from. Lexa has left clues on sending the beast back in the form of notes on a desk.</p>\n<p>Of course, that banishing this monster won't be without some risks.</p>\n<p>There are three timed puzzles, including one that requires text entry via keyboard. An interesting troubleshooting issue was coming up with controls and keys to press that weren't part of that puzzle in the scene.</p>\n<p>This was also my first time making sound assets, and it's obvious. :)</p>\n<p>Diversifiers:\u00a0<strong>Brxu Vhfuhw lv Vdih zlwk Ph,\u00a0Emotional Rollercoaster</strong></p><p>Meant to be played in fullscreen.</p><p>Play at\u00a0https://liluo.io/games/9d51f8af-54ec-440c-8c4d-138714c4d96a\u00a0(controls are a little janky.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T04:47:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c16/c16c19eb887b27f7afa88a420da5e642.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["schnoodlemedia"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
