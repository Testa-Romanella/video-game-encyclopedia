Things that shouldn't glow begin to glow, and ancient beings stir. Zoe must figure out how to appease the gods ... at least until the electricity comes back on.</p>\n<p>We humbly request that you please humbly play in the humble fullscreen mode.</p>\n<p>POINT-AND-CLICK INSTRUCTIONS: Click on items in the world to pick them up or interact.
