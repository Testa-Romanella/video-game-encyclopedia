Your goal is to destroy all of the weeds before they destroy your flowers. The problem is -\u00a0 as you kill weeds, more will spawn off of the weeds you have yet to kill.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The weed growth\u00a0limits your mobility by reducing the space you can move around in and it also forces you to cut paths as fast as you can so can reach flowers in order to protect them.</p>\n<p>If a weed grows on the base of a flower, the flower will warn you that it is under attack. If that weed reaches maturity, it will kill the flower. So, you must race to flowers that are under attack and destroy those invading weeds.</p>\n<p>To win the game, you must save as many flowers as you can, and destroy all of the weeds to prevent them from growing back. If all of the flowers die, you will lose.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Controller:<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left Stick/Directional Pad</strong> to Move.</li><li><strong>Right Action Buttons</strong> (eg.
