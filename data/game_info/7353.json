{"id": 7353, "slug": "back-to-bed", "name": "Back to Bed", "name_original": "Back to Bed", "description": "<p>Back to bed is an indie surreal puzzle game developed by Bedtime Digital Games. The game was initially developed as a student project for DADIU. The prototype was later expanded with the help from Kickstarter.</p>\n<p>The player&#39;s objective is to help a sleepwalker to safely get to his bed moving the objects in each level. The sleepwalker follows a distinct path. The players have to change this path and guide him in the right direction. The players have to be careful with their decisions as the sleepwalker can just walk off the level. Several entities can also prevent the sleepwalker from arriving at his destination. Most of these entities just block the path and have to be moved out of the way by the player.</p>\n<p>The game features a surreal art style which is somewhat inspired by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. There&#39;s also a small mix of the sixties inspired artwork which can be seen in the sleepwalker&#39;s outfit or simply the typography of the game.</p>", "metacritic": 57, "released": "2014-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T11:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43a/43a648790000e1317c81c268cf6c0ed7.jpg", "website": "http://www.bedtimedigitalgames.dk", "rating": 2.82, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 124, "owned": 1819, "beaten": 49, "toplay": 23, "dropped": 82, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 68, "ratings_count": 172, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 173, "platforms": ["Android", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 3", "Wii U", "Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Bedtime Digital Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["4EversGames", "Bedtime Digital Games", "2Awesome Studio", "Surreal Games ApS"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
