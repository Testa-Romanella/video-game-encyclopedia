They can find some of their\u00a0missing modules lying around*, but a robot can't reconfigure itself. They'll need each other's help to get\u00a0out of the place.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>* Except they still can't!</p>\n<p>This is an entry for the Photon Multiplayer Game Jam. Unfortunately, we could only create the first level, basically just an introduction to puzzle solving, during the time of the jam. Networking is hard!</p>\n<p>We plan to develop this a little bit more. The core mechanic of installing and combining modules\u00a0is not even part of the game yet! We still threw in something silly for those who will take the time to get to the end of this little demo we put together.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>The team was composed of me (Matteo Grilli), Francesco Frassineti, and Shapour Nemati.</p>\n<p>Also thanks to Acciaio's library for serializable dictionaries!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T11:43:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d1/1d171f8b83cde775f16e1ff0c66f8302.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gri_M"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
