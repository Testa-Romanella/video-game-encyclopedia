In fact, it's just the beginning!\r\nThe beginning of your new life as Zombie Employees!\u00a0\r\nWorking together with your fellow \u201c Zomployees\u201d, you'll ensure all our machinery is switched on, and stay on! No one operates a dead man switch like our beloved Zomployees.\u00a0\r\nAll our Zomployees are equipped with the latest in glow in the dark Uranium rods!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Welcome to the team!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Controls + Gameplay\r\n<br/>\r\nArrow or A+D keys to move Left/Right\r\nSpacebar to Jump\r\nShift key (or Just Die Button) to Kill your current Zombie character, leaving the body behind.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each Zombie can last for 30 seconds, before they expire for Uranium poisoning. Use their time wisely.\r\nEach level has 1 or more switches which need to be turned on (and remain on) before getting to the exit zone. Leave zombie bodies on the switches to keep them on.\r\nWatch out for hazards like spikes, acid, and more!\r\n</p>\n<p>Known slight bugs or quirks.\u00a0<br/>Occasionally the Jump button doesn't register while moving (not been able to pin down why, it's not very repeatable).\r\nI've left in the ability to \u201cshimmy\u201d up walls by bashing the jump key, rather then add a feet collider. I felt it added more fun to the game :).</p>\n<p>Credits<br/>\u201cDead End Job\u201d was designed, programmed (and voiced) by me (Peter Morgan).\u00a0\r\nThis game is my entry into the GameDev.TV game jam 2022.
