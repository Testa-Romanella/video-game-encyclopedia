So here is our take on it !</p>\n\n<p>The game implement 3 distinct areas for a total of 35 combat rooms. You loot charms at the end of each room and when you die you can decide one charm to keep permanently while loosing the others. Doing so you can make a build that correspond to you through the cours of a game. To balance this, you also lose a part of you max life at each death.<br/><br/><br/>The game is balanced as much as we could in the time available and still has some bugs, but we are convinced that even in this state it can provide a good experience, at least that's what we wish you!<br/><em><br/>Be aware that the browser version is particularly buggy and in the case of the user interface it does not work well with other screen sizes than 1080p at 16/9.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T09:01:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c0/0c085cc14a13711b96d5a8c3261c0bf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["LordKevep", "Enzo POLI", "Lucas FERRIER"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
