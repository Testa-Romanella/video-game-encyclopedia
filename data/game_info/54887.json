Received generally unfavorably by critics, the game marks a departure from other entries in the series, insofar as areas are explored with the playable character seen from a top-down perspective, with battles fought in first-person view. The story revolves around a viral outbreak on a passenger ship and has Leon S. Kennedy and Barry Burton return as protagonists.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-01T20:59:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/944/94405fb5920b2deaf1dfada027b91c35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.78, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Japan"], "esrb_rating": null}
