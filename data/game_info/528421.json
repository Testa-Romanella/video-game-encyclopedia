The vine-covered, wooden-paneled, slanted house stood with an alluring force that you had tried for so long to ignore. But, with your presence at its front door, you know that you have failed. You could try to convince yourself that you\u2019re just taking a quick peek. Just a small gander at the neighborhood spook. But you know better than to kid yourself. You\u2019re here to finally go inside this wretched building and claim its many, </em><em>many secrets as your own.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The House at the end of Bleeker Street</em> is a sprawling narrative adventure played from the perspective of a child.</p>\n<p>Throughout your journey, you will discover secrets and hints left by dozens of children who have since disappeared. These hints will guide you on your quest to find the entities responsible for the operation of The House. Occasionally, these hints will be tricks left by the malignant forces controlling the house. These tricks will mislead the player into attempting dangerous or unrelated activities in order to stop them from discovering The House\u2019s secrets.</p>\n<p>This was a final project for HPU's Narrative Design Course.</p>\n<p>Katie Pearson - Narrative Design, Art Design &amp; Character Design<br/></p>\n<p>Matt Boyer - Narrative Design, Implementation, &amp; Graphic Design</p>\n<p>Ross Woods - Narrative Design<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T06:49:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20c/20cfc79b207f6bd37565e3ced6987e48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Matt Boyer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
