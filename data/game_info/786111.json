This is an action-puzzle game about a frog eating bugs. 40 awesome and a bit difficult\u00a0levels\u00a0will challenge your quick problem solving and\u00a0aiming skills.\u00a0Nothing much to say more about it. Made for Mini Game Jam with love and sweat.</p>\r\nHow to play it then?\r\n<p>Your task is to destroy all colored bugs before the time runs out. Your frog shoots lasers in a straight line. You must eliminate all of the same colored bugs in one shot. One shot must touch only the bugs of one color (that is very important!). Do not try to shoot black wasps.\u00a0They will disappear on their own. You should complete all screens to finish the game. Every completed screen will reward you with some more time.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Left mouse button - shoot laser to the indicated point</li><li>Right mouse button - jump to the indicatedpoint</li><li>Escape - exit to main menu \\ close the game</li></ul>\r\nTips and tricks\r\n<p>You can't spam lasers, there is a 0.3 second recharge. Color of your laser indicates the result of your shot. White\u00a0- no bugs were touched / not all the bugs of the same color were touched / bugs of different colors were touched. Black - wasp was touched. Colored - successfull elimination of bugs.\u00a0Analyzing and memorizing the patterns is key to victory. There is always a way to beat level\u00a0consistently, you just need to fugure out how.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T07:55:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8d/f8de4e85ea968e09c3d2bbc9490f0d8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Udega"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
