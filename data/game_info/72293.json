The hexagonal match-3 gameplay is easy to learn, but crazy addicting! <br/>On your dive to the treasure at the bottom of the ocean, you'll have to match your way through many obstacles, meeting new friends and foes.<br/><br/>Clear the moss off your shiny pearls, grab them out of the arms of Octave the Octopus and collect them in ancient vases. Break through rocks, drop and collect seashells, open the clams, and defuse the sea mines. Oh, and don't forget to wake up Angie the cute Light Bulb Fish (yea yea it's an Anglerfish), to bring some light to the deep ocean.<br/>You won't get bored down here!<br/><br/>When the swimming gets though, there's always Willie the Swordfish to help you take a stab at things, the whirlpool to wash away your troubles or the rainbow pearl to match them all!<br/><br/>As with all our games, you don't have to wait for lives or annoy your friends to advance. Endless matching fun awaits! Just keep on eye on that timer, as time will pass quickly while playing this game!<br/><br/><br/>For more match-3 goodness, go to https://www.facebook.com/SmileyGamer", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:25:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6a/f6a8dd626742d2f2db5847bd6d5e3a6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SmileyGamer"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SmileyGamer"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
