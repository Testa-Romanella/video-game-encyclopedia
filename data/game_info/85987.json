The first 5 minutes where I talk about basic features are relevant to synthPond Lite<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>synthPond is a relaxing spatial sequencer and generative audio toy inspired by the work of Toshio Iwai.<br/><br/>Unlike a normal sequencer where you place notes on a grid and a moving playhead plays them, in synthPond you place nodes in a field (pond).<br/><br/>Because the system is spatial, it's easily graspable and very intuitive, but also very deep. While it's easy for someone with no music knowledge to create a complex melody, synthpond is also suited for advanced musicians who are interested in generative musical composition.<br/><br/>Additionally, the audio generated can be placed in a 3D space, occurring around the listener coming from the relative positions of each node. This also allows for spatial features like orbiting to create a more generative composition.<br/><br/>synthPond requires headphones, without them you may hear distorted or limited audio.<br/><br/>synthPond was built with mobileFrameworks, an iPhone related c++ library for artists<br/><br/>synthPond Lite includes most of the features from synthPond 1.0, but lacks many of the more complex features of synthPond 2.0, which is available for $1.99 USD", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T14:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45d/45dcbb4c9c69e5c275074b7b033d91fc.jpg", "website": "http://apps.stfj.net/synthPond/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zach Gage"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Zach Gage"], "esrb_rating": null}
