That means some things\r\nI have aren't completely finished, or end abruptly. There WILL be\r\nspelling errors and grammar errors so please make note that I might\r\nnot know where they are so please let me know so I can fix them.</p>\n<p>This is my first\r\ntime publishing a small cutscene demo so I am VERY nervous and hope\r\nthat it at least intrigues someone. If any dialogue sounds clunky\r\nplease let me know as I had a few areas where I was struggling to\r\nthink of what the characters would say/do.</p>\n\n<p>The game is supposed\r\nto have a few battles, but to make sure the cutscenes work I gave the\r\nplayer 2 skills, where they can use them to insta win or lose a\r\nbattle to see the different outcomes. The FOLLOWING BATTLES WILL BE\r\nTHE ONLY ONES THAT YOU CAN USE THE LOSE POWER TO GET THE ALT ENDING\r\nOF THE CUTSCENE:</p>\n<p>Dovine's fight</p>\n<p>Pyre's fight</p>\n<p>Game is compressed with RTP.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30a/30a356208997d49a908b2dd18a105ab8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Owltears"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
