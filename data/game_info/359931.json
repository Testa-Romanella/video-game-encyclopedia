But here it is, the theme was \"Only One\" and i make it around only one controller input, and a \"mini-story\" that follows only one structure and iterates itself.<br/><br/>This is my first entrie for a jam, and my very first game that isn\u00b4t a clone of something else, i don\u00b4t think this is original or innovative, but i feel proud of it, and probably i will extend and develope it further to make a finished game. Enjoy &lt;3<br/><br/>PD: i suck at time space between dialogues xd.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T14:44:03", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattPatrick"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
