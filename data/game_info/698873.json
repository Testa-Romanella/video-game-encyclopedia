While preparing to teach a Construct 3 class, I finally got my\u00a0chance . The participants chose to make a Tower Defense game - and that was all the incentive i needed.</p>\n<p>Another purpose for making this game is to show how accessible and easy game-making can be. I wanted to see how much I could do in a few short weeks - with onlly the 25 events that the free/no-sign-up version of Construct 3 allows.\u00a0 I love to encourage people and show them that they can create fun things without a lot of experience or a lot of money.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the\u00a0art is in the public domain but I like to credit the sources, so here they are:</p>\n<p>David Hellman's Braid art (it was a giveaway)</p>\n<p>Game Art Guppy</p>\n<p>Public Domain Vectors</p>\n<p>I also made a few small things in PowerPoint - which can be a great, simple art maker if you're creative and persistent.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T09:34:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f3/4f32c067f5032dc9b00144823399a11f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KayIsGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
