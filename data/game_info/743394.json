You remember eating your first slice of pizza at the local pizzeria. You remember how the cheese would slip off the crust and onto your new jeans. You remember that one cute employee who refilled your soda a little more than the others. You remember running out of tokens for the arcade and smacking the machines when they didn&#39;t work; and you remember how one of the animatronics winked at you and proceeded to flirtatious shake its hips at you the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Oh you don&#39;t?</p>\n<p>Well, on one night at the Steeze Pizzeria, something like that happened.</p>\n<p>Gameplay:<br />\nOne Night at the Steeze is a JPRG with Dark Souls elements in terms of level progression, difficulty and overall environment exploration. You collect tokens from battles and use them to increase your &quot;Pizza Club Rank&quot; or level, to gain new skills to face the horrors of the pizzeria with. Alternatively, you could take the quick and dirty route and pick up trash for some &quot;counterfeit&quot; ways to dispatch your enemies. You&#39;re at the pizzeria to have fun, just don&#39;t expect a to see a friendly face if you venture too far in.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<pre><code>Souls-like gameplay!\n\n\nEarthbound/Mother 3- inspired graphics!\n\n\nInspired by Five Nights at Freddie&amp;#39;s!\n\n\nMusic by Queen!\n\n\nStrange sense of humor!\n\n\nA cute pizzeria employee!\n\n\nPIZZA!\n</code></pre>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T15:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f17/f17bd67a1b06463bfebe52173e8932ed.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/9072/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
