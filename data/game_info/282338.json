The levels are procedurally generated and contain enemies that the player must fight off in order to have them drop items. At the end of a floor, the player drops down into a shop where they can sell all their items collected in order to upgrade their stats. The game features mechanics like: a weighted inventory system that allows the player to hold up to a certain amount of weight of items, combat system that lets the player attack in 8 different directions, and a difficulty system that makes enemies deal more damage, have more health, and spawn more often as the player progresses throughout sequential floors.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e9/1e9523af63b67576df08cad66eb2667f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarcoR"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
