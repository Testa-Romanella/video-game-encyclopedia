The goal of the game is to essentially survive for as long as you can, avoiding and blasting asteroids in the meantime.<br/></p>\n<p>This uses the second iteration of my custom game engine, called Yin, which you can find more information about it here. The engine was originally being designed with a very different game in mind, so it's been an interesting challenge mangling a lot of the technology to work for this.</p>\n<p>That said, this probably should be considered more of a tech demo than anything else, it's really not as fleshed out as I wanted it to be given it all sort of came together right in the last few weeks.<br/></p>\n<p>All the content created for the game is available here. All the models and their associated materials can be considered public domain.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>W/UP, forward</li><li>S/DOWN, backward</li><li>A/LEFT, left</li><li>D/RIGHT, right</li><li>CTRL, fire/select</li><li>ENTER, select</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T10:18:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/087/087e97092ba5ea39b14b0149529cfe84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hogsy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
