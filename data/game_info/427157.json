There are also 3 distinct enemy types and 3 distinct weapons - so hopefully this should keep you occupied for at least 5 minutes...</p>\n\n<p>I would love any feedback you have to offer. Also following me and sharing this with people you think would enjoy it would help me out massively! I will slowly but surely keep producing better and better content as and when I can find the time.</p>\n\n<p>Follow me on twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/madbookstudios</p>\n<p>Subscribe to my Youtube Channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_vCpox5w2ZXvh8fshC0_hA</p>\n<p>Link to website:\u00a0https://www.madbookstudios.com/</p>\n\n<p>Free music used in this mini-project:</p>\n<p><em>\"Exit the Premises\"\u00a0</em>Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:27:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aed/aede424b5704929587d2f03bc1661900.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madbookstudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
