Defeat the waves of enemies in this tower defence game. There is a twist at the end.</p>\n<p>-Left click to build a tower on a plot of land</p>\n<p>-Right click to pick up coins</p>\n<p>Use the buttons to change which tower to build</p>\n<p>Was made in 4 hours - slightly over the 3 hour target. I was going to add animations, music, particle effects and additional sounds,\u00a0but the important thing for me was conveying the concept of my idea and even though the game isn't exactly how I'd like it, it does demonstrate the 'twist' well enough.</p>\n<p>Sound effects by Juhani Junkala under Creative Commons license:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T12:27:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0de/0de36156db36737d8955a10665b82f0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tkellaway"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
