The concept was based on an actual series of tasks given to me by a therapist in the past.</p>\n<p>The player is tasked with leaving their home, walking across the street, successfully ordering a coffee, and returning home. When they step out of their home their mental health will rapidly decrease to zero, but as they continue to try the speed at which it decreases will slow, allowing them to get closer and closer to their goal with each attempt. Eventually it will stop going down at all, signaling them having gotten over their anxieties.</p>\n<p>For this project I handled all aspects of development, including design, programming, and art.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T06:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c562321c1e8fc7a9a3bd5df8543755d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thedobaga"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
