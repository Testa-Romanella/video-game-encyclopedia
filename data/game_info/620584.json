They all move together, jump together, and overcome obstacles simultaneously. They have different gravities and walk on different plains, but they move as one.<br/><br/>If a\u00a0character has reached the goal alone, a single piano key plays, but when they all reach the goal together, a piano chord plays instead.<br/><br/>Play 20 unique bite-sized puzzle\u00a0levels, including 6 mechanics, and even a boss fight.\u00a0<br/><br/>If you get <strong>STUCK</strong>, just press both the<strong> S and K keys to skip a stage.</strong><strong>\u00a0<br/><br/></strong>Want to <strong>RESTART</strong> a stage? Just press the <strong>R and E keys</strong> together.<br/><br/><strong>Keyboard Controls:</strong><br/>Arrow Keys to move and jump.<br/>or<br/>A and D to move, and W to jump.<br/><br/><br/>This game was made by just me, one person. I made the music as well.<br/>This gamejam's theme inspired me with many ideas for a sequel to a game I called <em>Mimicry</em>, which is available on STEAM.\u00a0<br/>In that game, you control 2 characters at once.\u00a0<br/><em>Mimicr i i i i</em> uses 4 characters instead each with set to their own gravity and orientation.\u00a0<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy, and please send me any feedback.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b4/8b441594f04d46f21c96549e10170f68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anxiety Monster"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
