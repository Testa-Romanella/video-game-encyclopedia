Please find their music on Bandcamp:</p>\n<p>https://steviasphere.bandcamp.com/album/pool-water-blue<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What's next:</strong></p>\n<p>The project is in its preliminary/demo phase. So expect more to come.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the game is developed I hope to expand the horror experience, but also introduce a multiplayer element as well. There will of course be additional stages and themes as the game progresses. Other additions will include benefits (such as buffs or abilities) for finding the collectibles (MAXIMS).<br/></p>\n<p>Please take your time to play the demo and leave feedback. I want to make this as good as possible!</p>\n<p>I have set up a Discord channel also, if you'd like to discuss in chat:<br/><br/>https://discord.com/channels/1028011581533081701/1028011583282102335<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T05:59:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d4ecaf198db75daa1e3f22ab7461ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Battle Stag"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
