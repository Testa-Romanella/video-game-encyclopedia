Key features do/will include proper orbital mechanics for all objects in space; detailed ship system control, functionality, inter-dependency and damage reaction; and the ability to move freely from one ship to another, EVA, and effect repairs while in flight.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRogue System\u2019s Core Module (CM) will be a complete campaign-driven sim on its own. It utilizes both dynamic as well as scripted missions to allow for greater replay-ability while telling an intriguing story.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFinally, Rogue System is fully moddable, allowing both DCI as well as the sim\u2019s community to add new ships, missions, and even campaigns.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLater, Extension Modules (EM) will add even more gameplay.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/891da046cd73e7b522f30d502ca65786.jpg", "website": "http://imagespaceinc.com/rogsys/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 113, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 337, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digits Crossed Interactive"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Image Space"], "esrb_rating": null}
