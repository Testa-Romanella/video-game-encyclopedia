Well, weight reduction. You can reduce weight for each and every car in 3 stages. By equipping the Stage 3 weight reduction, you also equip a roll cage.<br/><br/>ENGINE MODS<br/><br/>Engine mods come in 3 Stages. With the first stage, you replace the restrictive factory exhaust system,  install race cams, improve intake, upgrade to individual throttle bodies, upgrade injectors, and have a custom tune installed on your ECU, which you get some nice exhaust pops and backfires with. The second stage uses some E85 mix and of course some more aggressive ECU tune, with forced induction, and turbo boost level is at the lowest for maximum engine reliability, which still brings some serious WHP. And here comes the third stage of the engine mods, full ethanol and highest possible turbo boost with forged engine internals, forged pistons, and forged connecting rods, things that make the ultimate Drift car build a real race car. Hit the tracks and try it out for yourself.<br/><br/>SUSPENSION:<br/><br/>The suspension can be set up completely to your liking, set ride height, offset, camber, and test it on the tracks.<br/><br/>DYNAMIC SYSTEMS<br/><br/>Tyre smoke system has been fully rebuilt from the ground up. Tyre smoke doesn't just come from the wheels and that's it. With dynamic tire smoke, you get realistic smoke amount depending on your speed and angle, making it as realistic as possible. We took it a step further, not really a huge deal but small things matter, so here comes the brake disc glow. Depending on the load the brake discs get, which comes from speed and weight, your brake discs start to glow red as you heat them up with aggressive braking.<br/><br/>TRACKS<br/><br/>You can select from 5 tracks to Drift at, both available day and night. We tried to give some freedom to drifters, so most of the tracks are big spots and you can drift wherever you wish. Drift your style, freestyle.<br/><br/>RANDOM WEATHER<br/><br/>There are 20+ random weather conditions, both day and night, which gives a different feel to each track every time you play.<br/><br/>WHEELS<br/><br/>A huge selection of wheels is available to purchase for every single car.<br/><br/>YOUR GARAGE<br/><br/>Select from 7 garage styles to make yourself at home.<br/><br/><br/>If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:13:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ede/ede97d000d78e339ad440764f7c968e9_q6fqJdR.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/profisoftgames/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Adam Keninger"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Adam Keninger"], "esrb_rating": null}
