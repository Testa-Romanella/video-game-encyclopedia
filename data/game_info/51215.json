All of this has been fully optimized, fluent and accurate.<br/>\r\nThe game screen is very delicate, with majestic atmosphere of music, make you immersed.<br/>\r\nYou need to control your aircraft and collect two boxes in the game. You need to judge the magnitude of gravity, through the transmission of the orbit. Finally landing on the designated platform, remember that you can't land faster than the maximum landing speed of the aircraft. Here, we hope that you can learn the relevant knowledge of gravity, so that you can better pass the customs. The size of the gravitational force is proportional to the speed and range of the gravitational body, and in the game, you can see it at a glance.<br/>\r\nWe will continue to update the new level, let everyone play happily, and hope that you can fall in love with physics, understand the astrodynamics, and become an excellent scientist.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72a/72a7640d8ccab6673816d02835fdd70c.jpg", "website": "http://www.apillo.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 37, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Apillo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Apillo"], "esrb_rating": null}
