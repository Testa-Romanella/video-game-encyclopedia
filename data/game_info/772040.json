Dick, Galatic Pot-Healer</em>\r\n Game objective \r\n<p>\r\n  Reorganize some chaotically placed geometric objects at will following your inner NeedForOrder. You can choose to reorganize randomly \r\n  placed lines, squares, and disks. There is no specific goal...create your pattern/order: lower the entropy!\r\n</p>\r\n My goals \r\n<p> \r\n  Second attempt at game development using the\u00a0Godot engine with C#. Another \r\n  abstract/clean/simple 2D game without great expectations. Another much-needed learning project, building on the (little) knowledge acquired in the \r\n  making of StickyBlocks \r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build and complete another little abstract game (completely on my own)</li>\n<li>Learning new Godot-specific stuff: better use of collision layer, multi-resolution support, touchscreen support, Android export, annoying ads... \r\n    </li>\n<li>Put more faith in Godot and less in my maths skills (I studied theoretical physics): before going into the rabbit hole of mathematics, try to solve problems using Godot's features!</li><li>Learning new C# stuff, try to write more SOLID code (...not high hopes about these...) </li>\n<li>Create a base game mechanics (select/drag/drop/rotate/scale) to be reused in the future in different games</li>\n</ul>\r\n Simple controls \r\n<p>\r\n  Support mouse or touchScreen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LEFT-CLICK/TAP to select an object</li>\n<li>PRESSED and DRAG to move an object</li>\n<li>PRESSED and DRAG on the rotation icon to rotate an object</li>\n<li>LEFT-CLICK/TAP on UI buttons</li>\n<li>PRESSED and DRAG left/right on UI scroll elements to change the corresponding feature</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T09:45:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/425d876df83f53b74ae38ecf30b3a8ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NeurodivergentGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
