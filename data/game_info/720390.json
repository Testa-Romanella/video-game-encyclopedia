The theme for the competition was the HTML code 404. The game has it flaws but I fixed some bugs present in the JS13K upload (The biggest one was that animations were not playing properly).\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>The game is about a librarian that finds a weird book in the library where she works. She grabs this book and suddenly is transported to another world. She now wields a scepter instead of the book and she must find all the book's pages to return to her world. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Arrows - Move the character <br/></p>\n<p>X - Attack <br/></p>\n<p>Z - Jump<br/></p>\n<p>Programming and pixel art Ragnatic</p>\n<p>Art adviser CarolRiverArt<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58e/58ea05c3495cd52802744cdecf48efae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["irisinterludio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
