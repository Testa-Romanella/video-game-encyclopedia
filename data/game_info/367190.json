I\u2019ve put the clues together. I believe there is a connection. <br/>The 4 main gods of the past all seem to have these tablets in common. Eldorat\u2026 the God of Foundation. Prizmite\u2026 the God of Civilisation. Demotite\u2026 the God of Patience, and Helit\u2026 the God of Fire.<br/>I have been translating the tablets I have uncovered, and they seem to point to a location in the Ice capped mountains of Picchi d\u2019incontro. I have made plans to head out on an expedition to the Mountains. I have gathered a Crew that will come along with me. I only hope we find a connection. This would change everything\u2026<br/>-Leviticus Colman<br/><br/><br/><strong>Explorers Log #712</strong><br/>Day Unknown<br/>This may be the last words coming from me.
