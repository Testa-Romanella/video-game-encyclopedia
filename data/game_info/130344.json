Luckily, thousands of years of human colonization have left countless derelict space craft, abandoned space stations and the crumbling remains of human settlements ripe for looting. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately the galaxy is not quite dead yet. Genetically modified organisms, hardened for hostile environments, ancient mechanoids with corrupt A.I, rival scavengers, and countless hordes of humans who succumbed to a genocidal nanite plague, infest the dark corners of mankind's broken legacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>Derelict will not hold your hand. Nor will it take you to A&amp;E and call your mum when you've raided a derelict full of millennia old, raging androids, armed only with a knife. (Okay it will a bit, but only because my testers made me put a tutorial in).</p>\n<p>- A wide range of hand crafted and randomly generated open worlds to        explore.<br/>- Dozens of weapons, ships and equipment pieces to loot. <br/>- Multiple difficulties. From rogue light to rogueaaaAAAGH.<br/>- Hordes of enemies to gib.<br/>- NPC's to aid or end. <br/>- <strong>Grim Epitaphs.</strong> Seek out shrines lamenting your death for phat lewts.<br/>- State of the art 2D graphics with a fully customisable player character.</p>\n<p><strong>Redux overhaul:</strong></p>\n<p>The past year has been spent over-hauling the whole game. The Redux update brings the game closer to the original vision for the game.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 Rebuilt from the ground up in game maker studio 2.<br/>-\u00a0 Full pad support and rebinding.<br/>-\u00a0 New derelicts, planets and a completely remade space environment.<br/>-\u00a0 New enemy types.<br/>-\u00a0 New weapon and inventory systems.<br/>-\u00a0 [b]More grim Epitaphs.[/b]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Totally non-biased quotes from people who've played during development:</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"It's allright.\"</em> - Developers nephew.<br/><em>\"Pretty sure I had fun.\"</em> - Part time QA Tester Arpz.<br/><em>\"Looks like mario.\"</em> - Developers mum.<br/><em>\"420/10 would epitaph again.\"</em> - Dr Tester, PhD</p>\n<p><strong>Message from the Dev.</strong></p>\n<p>The game has been a labor of love over the past 3.5 years since i drunkenly decided to try and make a game, it's been coded and designed in my spare time, and tested by my hardcore group of friends. The aim was to make a top down shooter where you weren't constrained to loading up arena's and just fighting waves, one where you actually felt a part of the world.
