First a \r\npoint, then a \r\nline, and then a \r\ntriangle, and so on! The enemy launches bullets synced with the soundtracks' beats. You must avoid them in order to progress to the next level.</p>\n<p>For now we have implemented only 3 Levels due to the short time within the jam. But, we intend to develop it into a <strong>Bigger</strong> project in the future, so if you liked this game, please rate this game for the jam, and provide us with your feedback.</p>\n<p>Your feedback is valuable as it would help us in improving things for the final version.</p>\n<p>Included in this page is a Web Version made using pygame WASM, and also a downloadable executable file (windows only).</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out the game!</p>\n<p><em>Source code for the game can be found </em><em>here</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T11:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea7/ea711a7f448efbc09937a0b02f483ca8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Captain", "tank king", "okno"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
