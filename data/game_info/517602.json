{"id": 517602, "slug": "goblin-tennis", "name": "Goblin Tennis", "name_original": "Goblin Tennis", "description": "<p>The Drynzikz Open, the most prestigious tennis tournament in goblin world, is about to begin, and you are hoping to make some money off of it. Click on any player's face on either of the main tabs to see some information on the odds and to have access to betting and dirty tricks.<br/></p>\n<p>Matches take place one by one, moving from top to bottom down the left side of the bracket first and then the right. Once the first round of the tournament is completed, the quarterfinal matches will begin, again starting at the upper left.</p>\n<p>TO PLAY:<br/></p>\n<p>Before each match, read a newspaper on one player in the match, chosen randomly. All goblin tennis players are susceptible to underhanded tactics, but most are especially vulnerable to one type of trick, and the Racquet Racket usually has some clues.</p>\n<p>You have four stunts to pull: (1) \"Itching powder\" will place pepper in the player's shoes. (2) \"Poison\" will put compromising chemicals in the player's drinking water. (3) \"Sabotage\" will spread honey over the player's racquet. (Most goblins spell the word the French way. It makes the title of the newspaper funnier.)  (4) \"Bribe\" puts some coinage directly into a player's claws in exchange for a promise to perform poorly.</p>\n<p>All dirty tricks cost you money, so be careful of your wallet. You only start with 100 grorks.<br/></p>\n<p>After you perform your dirty work -- or not! -- you may place a bet on either player. Then go back to the Bracket tab and click \"Play Match\" to discover the winner and see how much money you made -- or lost.</p>\n<p>Keep going until a champion is declared. How much money did you end up with? Did your favorite survive?</p>\n<p>CREDITS<br/></p>\n<p>Game design by Brad and Ken Stephenson</p>\n<p>Coding by Brad Stephenson</p>\n<p>Artwork by Ken Stephenson</p>\n\n<p>Fonts:</p>\n<p>Dr. Caligari by ChromaticFonts<br/>Last Man on Earth by Dreadful Productions</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T03:38:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e19/e19432e9ebf072ebcdd00bf472cc87c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["professor1453"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
