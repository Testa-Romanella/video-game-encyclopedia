{"id": 396353, "slug": "stay-warm", "name": "Stay Warm", "name_original": "Stay Warm", "description": "<p>DISCLAIMER: Proto-type game for educational purposes.<br/><br/>Space to fire, wasd/arrow keys for movement, E to spawn turret.</p>\n\n\n<p>Ice is covering the world, and the Frozen Legion is on a quest to extinguish all the flame and heat in the world. Stand against the un-ending frozen blight headed your way; or feel the cold grasp of death.<br/></p>\n<p>This is basically a line-defense game, but the lines are not clearly distinguised. Enemies will keep spawning from the right-side of the screen and head to the left. Stop them; for if they get past, you will lose life until you die and need to restart.<br/></p>\n<p>You can spawn camp fires which shoot straight in front of them. These will slow down their rate of fire as time passes; but you can refresh and empower their speed by shooting at them; or have another camp fires fire at it. Currently camp fires have no cost, and no collision; so you can stack them. In a potential future version of this, it will cost heat (your score) to build these camp fires.</p>\n\n<p>Things to include before it can be more than a proto-type:<br/></p>\n<p>- Change the code to not be so reliant on 60FPS to function properly</p>\n<p>- Add in sounds and music</p>\n<p>- Main menu and score screen<br/></p>\n\n<p>A short test game for educational purposes of the creator. It includes basic movement, raycasting, prefabs, fps-based updating code. Run at 60-FPS.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T03:18:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/700/70072f442dd2ff0568f294dee57c138f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kashgor"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
