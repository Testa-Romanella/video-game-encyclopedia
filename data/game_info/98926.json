Quick note from the devs .-</strong><br/> <br/>\"Emily Morrison's Garden\" is supposed to be a hard game, requiring you to plan the best strategy while running from one point to the other to complete your tasks in time. It may take two-three plays to fully understand all the mechanics, use the \"help interface\"! (pressing H while in-game) <br/> <br/>--- <br/> <br/><strong>-. Instructions .-</strong><br/><br/>Best played on fullscreen. Highly recommended to download the desktop versions(web version might take a while to load sounds and music) and press \"H\" while playing your first game (that will trigger the help interface). <br/> <br/>Move around with the arrow keys, plant seeds with \"X\" and switch your selected plant with \"Z\". <br/> <br/>The planet is dying slowly and everytime you plant a new seed it regenerates. Plants bloom and die on a given season, collect fruits once they have bloomed to get more seeds. <br/> <br/>Pay attention to the interface, as it'll let you know when each plant will bloom or die. <br/> <br/>--- <br/> <br/><strong>-.
