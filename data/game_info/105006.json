The final project is everyone makes their own fighting game character. He then takes all their characters and puts them in this fighting game engine and holds a tournament where everyone competes to win using their own character!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAt this point, most of the music, backgrounds and tiles are placeholder assets and ripped off the internet. No copyright infringement is intended and no money is made off this game. As more content is submitted it will gradually replace all the content not originally created specifically for the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe would like to invite the public to submit their own characters to the game. All credit will be given and artists hold full intellectual property rights. A tutorial will be made for how to make them to this game's specs soon. Basically the characters need to be no taller than 96 pixels (64 preferred). Any characters 48 pixels or shorter will be doubled in size in the game engine. You MUST have the character's feet touching the bottom of the canvas, and the character needs to be centered. The animations should be submitted as individual GIFs and be as follows:\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t~REQUIRED~\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tIdle - 2 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tWalk - 2-4 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tCrouch - 1 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tJump - 1 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tStanding Attack - 3 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tCrouching Attack - 3 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tWalking on hands - 2-4 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tInjured - 1 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tDeath - 1 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tUpwards Attack - 3 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tInto Handspring - 1 frame min\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tHandspring Attack(out of handspring) - 1 frame min\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSubmit your characters \r\n\there.<br/>\r\n\tAll feedback and critique is welcomed and needed.
