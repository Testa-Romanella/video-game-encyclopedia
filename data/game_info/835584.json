Since the game is unfinished you're in control of the difficulty, however, one way of playing is to alternate pressing A and D (you can't press either two times in a row), while delivering the right bundles and organising the fridge...\u00a0Or abuse the physics system and keep spawning fruit until your computer can't handle it anymore.</p>\n<p>After a minute or so you'll realise that there is no difficulty curve or balance at all. So you could also\u00a0just create as much chaos as possible and try to handle it afterwards without delivering the wrong fruit bundles :)</p><p>Hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T08:52:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be1/be1dc9aee3bd4aab3c2bb92782e0d359.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lemon juice"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
