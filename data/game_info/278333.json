Of course you do! Do you have what it takes to catch all the babies? You just might...You must be quick and you have to be nimble. Just make sure you don't let any touch the ground!<br/><br/>As they fall faster and faster to the ground you'll have to move quickly to catch them in your basket. Don't look away for a second or else you'll miss one and it will drop to the ground! You don't want the game to end too soon! <br/><br/>Perfect for all age groups, it might be simple in concept but that doesn't mean it's not exciting! The fun graphics, increasingly high speed of the dropping objects, and the fact you have to stay on your toes is what will keep you coming back to this again and again. <br/><br/><br/>Features: <br/>* Great for all ages<br/>* Amazing graphics<br/>* Universal app supports iPhone / iPad / iPod Touch<br/>* Addictive Gaming <br/><br/>Download right now!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T02:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6e/f6e8d7a392a604186b7d75ec62bc8c14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Undone Panda", "Netsummit Marketing"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Family"], "publishers": ["Netsummit Marketing", "Undone Panda"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
