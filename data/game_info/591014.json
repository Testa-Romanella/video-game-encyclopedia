The game is divided into two parts: LAN battle and single levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\nSingle levels are divided into large and small levels. The big levels are adapted from historical battles, Players need to rely on strategy to win. The small levels are adapted from historical events and rely more on the player's micro-manipulation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnlike other World War II games that either manage troops from a global perspective or focus on individual operations, this game uses the operating methods of traditional real-time strategy games, but pays more attention to thinking about the battle from the overall perspective. In this way, players can see and command their troops how to fight directly, and they can also use the Strategist's thinking to advance and win the game<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game introduces some new concepts, such as supply. The troops need to be supplied to act. When the supply line is cut off, the troops will lose their combat effectiveness in a short time. This way, the enemy can be defeated by cutting off the enemy's supply, therefore, more strategies and tactics can be realized<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game also reproduces the concept of armor and penetrate. When the enemy's armor is thick enough, your weapon will not be able to penetrate the enemy's armor, and you must go around behind the enemy to attack.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game also supports the weather system, adding more random factors to the battlefield", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T02:45:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d9/6d9121888909bb044d6760265175a74b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 417, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u6e38\u620f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u6e38\u620f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
