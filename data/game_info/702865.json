He is very meticulous, so he hates undetected bugs in the applications he works with. If a bug gets past him it really pisses him off. More than bugs Edward hates only insects. These little creeping things have always inspired animal fear in him. Monotonous work, setbacks in his personal life and lack of prospects leave their imprint on Edward's psyche. One typical day, while testing another program, he notices how various bugs suddenly begin to crawl on his screen. Edward tries to kill them all. However, attempts to get rid of them seem futile. More Edward kills, more new bugs creep into his screen. Worse, the bugs he looks for in the app have strangely also turned into insects. How it all bugs him off. Help Edward destroy all the bugs and find all the bugs before he finally goes crazy.</p>\n<p>Git URL\u00a0https://github.com/DrLuciferrr/I_HATE_BUGs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T06:44:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f4e1b9c90b54ced57dded8d869cb3d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DrLucifer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
