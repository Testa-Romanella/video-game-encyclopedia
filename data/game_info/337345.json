{"id": 337345, "slug": "mutiny-an-erotic-visual-novel", "name": "Mutiny!! - An Erotic Visual Novel", "name_original": "Mutiny!! - An Erotic Visual Novel", "description": "<p>Mutiny!! is set in a world of fantasy, and adventure. A realm where airships can sail among the clouds as well as the sea, entering the flogiston to journey to other planes. There\u2019s treasure spread out over many planes if you\u2019re brave or curious enough to find it! At the bottom of the sea or within mysterious ruins, protected by curious animated guardians. The world of Mutiny!! is in every way \u2018fun\u2019, silly and sexy as you imagine!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everything begins with you sat at a table, adjusting your clothes and blowing a kiss to the cute little Fairy you\u2019d spent the afternoon with. The \u2018Captain\u2019 comes in; a haggard and tired figure. Still, they might make for some interesting company, seeing as how captains have ships, money, and go on exciting adventures.<br/><br/>It becomes readily apparent that she\u2019s on her last legs, announcing that the Pirate life is hard, and her luck is drained to the final dregs. The Navy is on her tail, and her ship is being scuttled with debt. Of course, you\u2019re happy to offer a little \u2018Stress Relief\u2019, but she confesses she hasn\u2019t a penny to her name. Hell\u2014 she probably couldn\u2019t find gold in a chest.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>You sigh and shrug; you\u2019ve always been particularly lucky. The Captain seems awfully enticed at the whole prospect of some life-changing luck.<br/><br/>The little conversation is brought to a screeching halt by the sound of Navy boots stomping their way through the building next door. Not an issue to you of course, but the \u2018Captain\u2019 seems to be missing some facial coloration all of a sudden. Then with a snap of her fingers, she\u2019s up and out of her seat with a brand new purpose, tossing her hat onto your head.</p>\n<p>\u201cMust be fate!\u201d she announces pleasantly, and while you\u2019re still trying to figure out what\u2019s going on, her jacket is thrown over your shoulders. There\u2019s a scampering, a yelping of alarm from one of the patrons, and then silence.<br/><br/>Once you\u2019ve got the hat off from over your eyes, the \u2018Captain\u2019 is nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>Skipping past the Navy isn\u2019t an issue for you, and the real culprit is long gone. Nothing for it but to find this woman\u2019s ship and get things sorted out.<br/><br/>\u2026 Or at least give back the hat and jacket\u2026 despite how totally cool they are.<br/><br/>Once you get there, you find a mismatched crew of helplessly inept girls who weren\u2019t even a hundred percent sure they were pirates the whole time.<br/><br/>The crew announce that it\u2019s unlikely the \u2018ex-captain\u2019 is coming back. She gave over the hat and jacket after all! That\u2019s all it takes; its proof!<br/><br/>You scoff at the ridiculousness of it all, intending to drop the hat onto one of the girl\u2019s heads. She gasps and scrambles away, begging you not to put that evil on her.<br/><br/>It takes you a while to come to terms with it all, but it seems you\u2019re in charge now! First step, re-name the ship. Second step? Find a way out of debt. Third step? \u2026 We\u2019ll figure it out somehow.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warning</strong></p>\n<p><em>Features dickgirls, animal girls, spider girls, oviposition, animal anatomy on humanoid characters in a sexual and non-sexual context,\u00a0\u00a0moths, wholesomeness, hyper-active canine companion.</em></p><p><strong>Follow Us</strong></p>\n<p>Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/Lupiesoft</p><p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/shoujo_city\u00a0</p><p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/dP6qyVb</p>\n<p><strong>Key Game Features</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022\t11 unique girls to encounter<br/>\u2022\tA long, sprawling campaign story comprises the main game<br/>\u2022\t2 free additionaly character side-stories are included with the game, with more adventures and side-stories to come after launch!<br/>\u2022\t12 different locations<br/>\u2022\tPuzzle-solving minigames, and ship combat<br/>\u2022\tMonster Girl romance<br/>\u2022\tDifferent social options shape your relationships and ending<br/>\u2022\tVisual Novel style interactions<br/>\u2022\tCharming music and sexy, glamorous art<br/>\u2022\tDRM Free<br/>\u2022\tWindows, Mac, and Linux</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:32:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f05/f0599d4fef4be843693da10283aa2c00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lupiesoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
