The idea spawned from wanting to make a Crazy Taxi-like game but a little more my style with a little more story behind the character and the world.<br/><br/>This is just a prototype. There's plenty of work to be done if I keep moving forward, but I wanted to show off what I've been working on and see if anybody else likes the idea and direction.<br/><br/>This game was created and developed by myself, using assets from\u00a0Synty Studios and music from bensound.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T06:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dc/5dcd4b421e401053a3f0b9c9c8096589.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AesopB3EF"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
