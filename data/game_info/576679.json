Is there something more fascinating, curious and interesting than the universe? I bet not. Complex, rich and dynamic, this vast space that contains us can show the most unimaginable realities and surprise us at every step. For this reason, any documentary, book or story about the sun itself will catch even those furthest from interest in science.</p>\n<p>Have you ever dreamed of being able to travel the universe, see other planets, discover a new one or even colonize it?</p>\n<p>\"Those who dream during the day are aware of many things that escape those who only dream at night\" Edgar Allan Poe.</p>\n<p>So that you don't stop dreaming, we bring you Beyond Unknown.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T05:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96b37fece05efedea3922d5161a4f2f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eric Valero"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
