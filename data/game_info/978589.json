Joy, trust, fear... Each initial emotion corresponds to different initial attributes and props. \"Inject\" and control the characters to build 8 basic emotions, looking for the answer named \"Unintentionaler\".<h3>Background settings:</h3>In the past, carriages and horses were very slow, and letters were far away. Doves connected the two ends of longing, symbolizing \"love and peace\";<br/>Nowadays, machines are noisy, people are crowded, and information is expanding. Flying doves symbolizes \"betrayal and disputes.\"<br/>In a certain cyberpunk future world timeline, more and more people in a society where order has collapsed must correctly understand and process the emotions encountered at a faster speed:<br/>The waiter in the restaurant mistakenly captured the mood of the guest, and the office staff failed to understand the leader's thoughts in time, and they lost their jobs...<br/>Those who were greedy for pleasure before their lives were settled, got pregnant before marriage, had no one to take care of their offspring, those affected by the war, their emotions, and where should their future go?<br/>With great anticipation, AlphaMood has developed the first-generation discrete heart emotion module. One of the important functions of this module is to train participants' adaptability to the module through simulated consciousness. This test activity is now recruiting volunteers.<br/>\"Everything is becoming faster, and so are emotions,\" an anonymous person commented. \"It is imperative to implant electronic emotional chips.\"<br/>As a result, one after another emotionally numb characters, who have been beaten to death by life, are planning to participate in emotional module training and become the \"Unintentionaler\" who knows better about \"relaxation\", and all their worries will disappear.<br/>We are one step closer to becoming the best tool person who knows how to work without eating or drinking. \"This is just a small step for AlphaMood, but it is a giant step for all part-time workers,\" AlphaMood's CEO said at the press conference.<h3>Main target:</h3>None of the above is what the player should care about, the player only needs to complete the game.<br/>The main goal of each game is to find the empathy recipe for empathy within a limited time index(a value used to simulate real time) and become an \"Unintentionaler\", And you can complete a game by talking to the \"Guider\".<h3>Main features:</h3><br/><ul><li> Emotion-building is the core gameplay, which is inspired by the Plutchik-wheel<br/>    1. Restores the main content of the emotion wheel theory, including basic emotions, combined emotions, etc.<br/>    2. Emotions are set to increase or decrease various abilities. After obtaining the empathy recipe, you can adjust this combination through empathy.<br/>    3. You need to decide for yourself which emotions you should obtain or retain based on the situation you encounter, and...occasionally you may encounter a little accident that breaks your plan.<br/>    4. The guider will only allow complete the game people who is \"Unintentionaler\".<br/></li><li> There are not many system-level restrictions. Players do not have to play a certain protagonist to save the world in some way. You can deliberately play a certain role, it is up to you.<br/></li><li> Interact with NPCs. The plot includes puzzle elements. There may be connections between various plots, but they do not necessarily have to be connected.<br/></li><li> Simplified ARPG combat system: There are no fancy skills and magic systems, and there are several cold weapons that can be used as combat weapons.<br/></li><li> Mild ROGUE: Tailored RogueLike mechanism.<br/>    1.

Randomly generated sub-maps (generated once per game, different sub-maps will have different terrain and a greater possibility of encountering specific types of units).<br/>    3. Random attribute point rewards.<br/>    4. Encounter randomly generated units in the sub-map and choose possible plots.<br/>    5. All units, including players, can pick up items, have independent archives and will die permanently<br/></li><li> Trading system: You can trade with most NPCs and use currency to exchange for the items you want in their hands.<br/></li><li> Synthesis system: items can be synthesized after obtaining the recipe<br/></li><li> Freely decide the life and death of all NPCs, There are no battles limited by the plot.<br/></li><li> All units have the possibility of actively triggering battles (all units have no camp)<br/></li><li> All units are randomly generated and grow with the growth of the player-controlled character.<br/></li><li> After getting familiar with it, the game time can be controlled within 30 minutes, which is suitable for fragmented time.<br/><br/>Hope you have fun and live a happy life!<br/>The most important thing is: remember to \"relax\" when you are in a bad mood.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-18T05:45:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57fa37cb678c03724d44b6b60a5c8005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["leakart"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["leakart"], "esrb_rating": null}
