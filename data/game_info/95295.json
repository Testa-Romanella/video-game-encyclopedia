Also you can compete with other players cross platform. In Timbertales you will first have to draft an army before you can start a match. Unlike other turn based strategy games: You will not have to produce units. Its more based on a table top strategy game approach, where you have to build up an army with a specific point limit before the match starts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89d/89d853f042a8d1b5d4cac1252e8b4f3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rainware"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
