Also fixed a few text bugs as well (one that was cropped, one with a typo).</p><p>SECOND EDIT : Fixed a bug that broke the main puzzle, I'm very sorry for those who encountered it!</p><p>EDIT : Slight update to the game, added a menu (press escape during the game) that allow you to restart the game and quit.
