You and a friend have taken shelter in the local mall...\"</p>\n<p>You control a group of survivors, taking shelter in their community mall from the symptoms of a drastic viral infection: Zombies. \u00a0Scavenge the abandoned shops for leftover supplies and other useful gear, find hiding survivors to join your group, discover the best place and build up your colony, and ultimately survive as long as you can in the face of this horrible tragedy.</p>\n<p>Control a growing group of survivors, switch between them in real time and micro-manage them to take best advantage of fleeting time. The mall becomes more and more horrific as time goes on, you have some recourse, but ultimately the situation seems doomed. Build different kinds of barricades (in future versions, upgrade these into traps), \u00a0benches to craft equipment out of scavenged materials, storage containers to stock excess materials, as well as a few things which may make life a little less bleak in the face of these dire circumstances.</p>\n<p>Delve further and further into the increasingly treacherous mall to turn up better supplies, but be careful. As you traverse further into the mall you will find conditions become more dire, and the zombies become stronger and stranger. Crafting higher level supplies and medicine can help you make it further in, and hopefully bring back some useful stuff.</p>\n<p>Ultimately you will find you have to delve deeper, as supplies in the earlier areas of the mall begin to dwindle, hopefully you are able to prepare for this and move your settlement further as time goes on. Perhaps there is an answer to this catastrophe somewhere along the way? Otherwise it only seems to be a matter of time until you and your party join the shambling masses,</p>\n<p>Oh, and also if you like what you see, and want to see more, better, stronger, and faster; pop on over to https://www.patreon.com/fairweatherstudios to support me!
