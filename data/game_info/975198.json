I think it is suitable for players who like challenging battles and are not bored of dying over and over.<br/>While each enemy demands a different fighting style, fighting against them simultaneously may be an undesirable play style for some players. <br/>The game has a demo that is quite sufficient to introduce itself. <strong>I don't  recommend you to buy it without trying it.</strong><br/><br/>The first chapter is available in early access. The second chapter will only be the Boss versions of the enemies you encounter. In short, the game is not very long, but I hope you have a challenging and fun journey of 2-4 hours.I hope to make improvements and corrections according to your feedback during the early access period. Among these improvements is a mode that allows you to create your own arena.<br/><br/><strong>STORY</strong><br/><br/>Erlik Han the god of underworld (Tamag) wakes up and tries to return to earth as he promised to Father. \"Asena '' the wolf goddess will help him to succeed in this adventure.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/><br/>50+ different Skills<br/>14 unique levels with 2-4 Hours storyline gameplay .<br/>10 unique enemies with different battle tactics and 4 different difficulty and Boss Modes.<br/>Endless Arena Mode<br/>Demo contains 3 storyline level and Endless dungeon mode.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-15T05:08:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/428cec7286ac26d29e1c6203474ffffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OE WORKS"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["OE WORKS"], "esrb_rating": null}
