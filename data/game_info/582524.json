The theme was \"Drag and Drop\".</p>\n<p>I decided to go for a simple and relaxing art game, where you can drag randomly colored pixels onto a canvas (I got frustrated with the snap to grid funcion, but let's just call it a feature for now :D)</p>\n<p>What fun images can you come up with? Feel free to share them!</p>\n<p>Thanks for this fun jam, best regards</p>\n<p>misterG</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T18:56:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e4193f7fea060a50b1a73b9579594d70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["misterG420"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
