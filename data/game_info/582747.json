It's more a self-inflicted hackathlon project than anything else. As of 0.9 I worked about 2 and half day on the game and it's kind of playable : you can drift, do hotlaps, your car can crash and burn. The GUI is super simplistic, and apart from the arrow keys to accelerate, brake and steer the only other active key is F5 to restart (it resets the game completely, so you'll lose any hotlap time).</p>\n<p>Plans are to add some AI, though , considering all the drifting needed to complete a lap in an acceptable time, I'm not sure I am good enough to write it. Still ... I'll try.<br/>Multiplayer (over network or even splitscreen) is also something I'll look into.<br/><br/>The game was written with Godot 3.2 once again. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T19:50:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec5/ec52074d19ed7c630ff83ec660bdf98c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sammy Fischer"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
