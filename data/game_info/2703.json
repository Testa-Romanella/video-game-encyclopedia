{"id": 2703, "slug": "dreii", "name": "Dreii", "name_original": "Dreii", "description": "Experience the\u00a0mesmerizing world of Dreii, the award-winning collaborative physics conundrum.\u00a0<br/>Dreii is a puzzling game about skill, logic and friendship. It subtly connects players in real-time across the world, to help one another in a battle against gravity.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Build a Tower.</strong> The mission is simple. But once again, things get in the way... Explosives, thunderstorms, completely incompetent colleagues. Oh, and have you heard of this thing called gravity?<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Play with your friends.</strong> Dreii automatically connects all screens across all platforms. This means you can even play with your friends who have Dreii on their mobiles.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Speak in 19 Languages.</strong> Dreii features an universal communication tool which allows players to speak to others, wherever they are in the world.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Let's Dance!</strong> One of the best thing about Dreii is how it sounds. Each player has its very own instrument. Avatars work together to form Dreii's unique universal orchestra, creating a unique musical landscape, inspired by archaic instruments and ancient melodies.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Uber Swiss Design.</strong>\u00a0Dreii is designed to be as universal as possible. However, in a strange way it's also very Swiss, where it was made. Clean typography, minimalism with attention to detail. Maybe that is why it has won the European Design Award.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abe/abe1740908926dc6b90fefd0ef4db2e4.jpeg", "website": "http://dreii.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Linux", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Etter Studio", "BitForge"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Etter Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
