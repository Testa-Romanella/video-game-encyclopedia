It is by far not a very polished title, but yet I am still proud of it! It's my 2nd \"official\" game I made awhile ago. Oh the nostalgia!</p><p>**DISCLAIMER** The audio got a little bit messed up when I retrieved these old files and it is all scratchy. Unfortunately I can't find a way to fix it. But there are some comedic dialogue if you'd like to hear :) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35c3db52f26e078ff48b46de13cdf1e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stu Bean"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
