{"id": 15657, "slug": "guardian-arena", "name": "Guardian Arena", "name_original": "Guardian Arena", "description": "Guardian Arena is a VR game in development for HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and OSVR.<br/><br/>Inspired by classic online multiplayer shooters such as Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament, Guardian Arena gives players a fresh new perspective to some classic game modes.Multiplayer Shooter from a Fresh Perspective<br/>While Guardian Arena is inspired by First Person Shooter games such as Quake and UT, it isn't played from a first person perspective. While VR is a perfect match for first person games, the goal with Guardian Arena is to give you a fresh experience different to other available VR games.<br/><br/>In Guardian Arena, you control your character from an up-from-above God-like perspective. Watch over your player as you maneuver him through the arena. Scale the entire arena down to a table sized miniature to view the entire battle or scale it up to get closer to the action.<br/><br/>This god-like perspective means you can enjoy a frantic Quake-like pace without worrying about locomotion or other first-person issues.<br/><br/>If you've played 'Longbow' in 'The Lab' by Valve, you might remember the miniature table right before you start. Imagine walking around that table while a game of Quake plays out with miniature characters. That's Guardian Arena.Built for all VR on PC<br/>The goal for Guardian Arena is to allow any person with a PC based VR headset to join in the action. You can choose to play seated, standing or room-scale with or without motion controllers (gamepad required).<br/><br/>Guardian Arena has been built from the ground up for HTC Vive, but support for Oculus Rift and OSVR is in development. Supporting all VR headsets is a big priority in development.Built with UE4 with performance in mind<br/>Guardian Arena takes advantage of Unreal Engine 4's new forward rendered with MSAA. This means better performance and improved clarity for all systems. Individual graphics options such as supersampling, anti-aliasing and shadow/effects quality are all available in-game to tune in the perfect experience for your system.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e775e965b0a22fab01944fdee5311977.jpg", "website": "http://purplesquidgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 323, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Purple Squid Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Purple Squid Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
