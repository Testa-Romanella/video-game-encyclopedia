The player must traverse a never ending crowd of people. The player can choose to move forward (against the crowd) while increasing their feelings of nervousness or the player can choose to interact with people to decrease their nervous feelings and increase their confidence. <br/></p>\n<p>The player moves through the crowd easier/faster if they are confident. If the player is nervous they move slower through the crowd. The player will also engage in a situation that places the player against themself, forcing the player in a standstill thus preventing any progress. It is a person's own judgement and willingness to move against their anxiety in order to make it better. Towards the end, nothing can be completely forgotten thus the player's controls remain the same but move in the opposite direction. The game concludes the same way it began - this time moving with the current.</p>\n<p>The game is made using p5.js</p>\n<p>Produced by Eddson Jose<br/>Music and Art by Eddson Jose</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T02:58:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/072/07298cc0b9e330ece88b60eb5151baf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eddsonjose"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
