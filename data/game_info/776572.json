{"id": 776572, "slug": "mouse-joust", "name": "Mouse Joust", "name_original": "Mouse Joust", "description": "<p>Mouse Joust is a rival card game in which players place cards as units on a 5x5 board, moving them around like chess pieces or activating certain effects. Each player has a deck of 12 cards. Each card has four numbers that determine its \u201cstrength\u201d in each of the cardinal directions. Once opposing cards collide, they battle using the numbers that face the opposing card. The stronger card wins and flips the other card to the winning player\u2019s color. The primary win condition is to have more cards of your color by the end of the game. Each player also has a powerful \u201cking\u201d card called a Conqueror that can be captured or surrounded to immediately win the game.</p>\n<p>Mouse Joust centers around a bunch of adorable rodents playing pretend, imagining a fantasy world where they fashion themselves to be kings, queens, knights, nobles, thieves, assassins, and adventurers.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T07:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/261/261620d7ac2a38a2ae72d52d9dcd55ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["amr70493"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
