Seeing that, I thought &amp;quot;Well, I best make some content specifically for e-sports!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>In the last 10 years I've scrapped the project twice. It wasn't until my third attempt that I created what is now known as EF-12.<br/><br/>Video games are, in comparison to other mediums, not held in very high regard by society. A player who took home a prestigious prize from a large e-sports event is unlikely to receive any sort of attention from society at large.<br/><br/>I think the fact many think of video games merely as time-wasters, or nothing more than a tool for companies to make money is a major reason for this.<br/><br/>Shogi, or Japanese chess, started out in much the same way - as nothing more than a simple game. However, its pioneers worked hard to promote it, and now players are respected in society.<br/><br/>I believe for video games to achieve a similar level of respect, there are two important things:<br/><br/><ul><li>    We must move away from the business-oriented concept of &amp;quot;If it won't sell, we won't make it&amp;quot;<br/></li><li>    The game must be able to be quickly fine-tuned and balanced by users to maintain it's competitive element.</li></ul><br/>EF-12 was developed with rule 1 as it's primary goal. I believe rule 2 has also been achieved.<br/><br/>I am very much looking forward to the day when users can join me in keeping both of these rules alive. Until then, I will keep working on EF-12 by myself.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7b/d7b45b9d0f612da48ea8165d603c9921.jpg", "website": "http://ef-12.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 413, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QUAD ARROW Co.,Ltd."], "genres": [], "publishers": ["AGM PLAYISM"], "esrb_rating": null}
