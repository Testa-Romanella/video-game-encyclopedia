Send them on their way, but modify their instructions so that they no longer resemble what they once were...\r\n<p>In this game you build great machines using\u00a0conveyors, branches, and writers. You will have to think carefully about each design, as the\u00a0Great Machine\u00a0has keen senses, and knows when you are trying to get away with something.\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0How to Play\u00a0\r\n<p>\u00a0Select a stage at the Stage Selection screen, then read the description in the lower-right to learn what your objective is.\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0The Bot\u00a0\r\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0Each bot has a \"tape\", an array of colored indicators that can be read and often times, have to be converted to new data. Bots can be \"accepted\" or \"rejected\". A rejected bot just has to be thrown on the floor, while an accepted bot has to reach the exit.      \u00a0The tape reads from right-to-left, with the current marker being on the dot indicated by the box.  Other markers in the queue will be pushed right when the current marker is removed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0There are three types of objects you can build:\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nConveyors move robots around the machine.\r\n\r\nBranches add logic to your system. When working with bots, you will need to make logical decisions, and these will aid you in that. Bots will steer towards the direction that matches a color on the branch arrows.\r\n\r\nWriters add to a bot's tape. You can write many types of colors and with this system, it is flexible enough to let you define the meaning of each color. Use this power carefully to solve problems.<br/>\r\nOptional Download\r\n<p>You may choose to download this file optionally for on-the-go / local play.
