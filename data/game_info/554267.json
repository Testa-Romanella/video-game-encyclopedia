I was recently playing hollow knight again and was inspired by the games boss fights, so i made this. sure it doesn't look great so think of it as a proof of concept, also the boss's name is Oss i did not misspell that. also more boss fights will be coming.</p>\n<p>Tip: there is a counter in the top right with the numerical value of the boss's next attack if you can memorize the number associated with an attack you might be able to react quicker.</p>\n<p>controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - A and D control left and right, W is jump, and S is to fast fall.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - you can attack right, left and up, not downwards.</p>\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<p>if it doesn't let you move reload the page.</p>\n<p>also sometimes he dashes backwards but I lost the editable file so I cant fix that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T09:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/224ebe750382446e38bd689963ed55e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["beeeans"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
