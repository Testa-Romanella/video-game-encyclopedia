The event is a fun way for high schoolers to get together, create games/apps, and learn new skills.</p>\n<p>At 1am \u2014 when half the students are getting sleepy, and the other half are crackin\u2019 open bottles of Monster \u2014 my friend and I decided to design a little video game ourselves. Inspired by the students we had met and worked with during the day, we began working on a game based on our experiences as mentors; a digital diary of our time at CodeDay.</p>\n<p>Though we didn\u2019t finish that night (the kids who drank Monster were bouncing off the walls), I later returned to the project and completed it. It encapsulates the quirky but thought-provoking atmosphere at the event.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys\u00a0\u2014 move</p>\n<p>Spacebar\u00a0\u2014 talk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20b/20bdfeb781f0c8ad0226507a789bf153.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jon Tiburzi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
