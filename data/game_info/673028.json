The user control is just a three-qubit circuit composer with circuit depth = 3, and by using X, H, and CX gates we asked user to come up with states match to the falling enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>The idea that I am experimenting is how to represent in-game locations with quantum states. In Qilin this is realized in controlling where the laser beams are shooting. It requires proficient understanding of 3-qubit states and the player's fast response to put together a quantum circuit which maps to the enemy's location using circuit composer. The goal is simple - shoot down as many as enemies as you can!</p>\r\nA detail walkthrough for gameplay\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7a/a7ada2f5d04f96d2e2b49590b770023d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wslu42"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
