The only gameplay is to kill as many people as you can by flying over them. The game ends after a set amount of time (just after sundown). The controls are \"tank-like\", meaning that movement is relative to the direction the monster is facing, not the camera.</p><br/>Default Controls (configurable from launcher in standalone builds):<p><strong>Movement:</strong> WASD keys/Arrow keys/Left Stick(gamepad)<br/><strong>Turn:</strong> QE keys/LR(gamepad)<br/><strong>Pause/Quit at end:</strong> Esc/Start(gamepad)<br/><strong>Submit(in menu):</strong> Enter/Return/A button(gamepad)<br/><strong>Toggle image effects:</strong> U(Depth of Field) I(Fisheye) O(Noise and grain)<br/><strong>Gamepad note:</strong> I've only tested the defaults with an XBox 360 controller on Windows</p><br/>Credits/Tools:<br/><p><strong>Engine &amp; Standard assets:</strong> Unity 5.1.2f1 Personal<br/>Game Jam Template from Unity Technologies (primarily base for menus/pause screen)<br/><strong>Music:</strong> Base midi file generated from abundant-music.com<br/>Edited using LMMS using the FLUID R3 soundfont by Frank Wen<br/><strong>Some Textures:</strong> cgtextures.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/ddd5b789822de191b4606be3b7fc79a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["KuGrou"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
