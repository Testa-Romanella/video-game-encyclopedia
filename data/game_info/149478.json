I decided to make Snake because it was a simple game that I was familiar with and not too ambitious. I included lots of different modes and themes\u2014my favorite mode is Tron Mode, definitely try it! Every 3 points you get, your tail will be erased. It adds a new level of skill to an old game.<br/><br/>Try and beat all of the all time high scores\u2014 they're my personal bests for each mode. You might notice there is also a \"last hi\". Last hi just records the last local high score (in case my personal bests are too difficult to beat...probably not).<br/><br/>I'd love to hear any feedback (good or bad, I don't mind) and your personal highest scores!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/811/8114e77f940d2cecfa650f7b4c5055d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SunriseMoon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
