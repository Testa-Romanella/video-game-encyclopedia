Late at night, she goes to pay a visit to the old, abandoned estate. She has to simply record the location and the findings around that area, but something went wrong, because the footage was found days later by the local police. What is on that footage - play and find out.\u00a0<br/><br/>This is a very short game, which includes loud noises and creepy atmosphere. During the development of this project I got sick and had a writer's block - I could not come up with anything fresh to make the game longer. But, it is what it is. Hope you enjoy it. All the criticisms, feedback and comments are super welcome. Best to you and thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T06:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6eb7c112def380f3cd13302d63b59207.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niven Hedinger"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
