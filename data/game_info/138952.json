Named sticky. Your grandfather left you a legendary sword to defend the world with. Unfortunately, you're a procrastinator and left the sword laying around in a pool of goo. It got rusty, and deals 0 damage. It gained the magical property of stickiness. Now, you must finally venture out and destroy the evil monsters that are attacking by sticking them to your sword and beating the enemies in the face with their own brethren.</p>\n<p>It's a small game, and still has bugs. It is my first game jam as someone rather new to programming in general. Don't cringe too much. ; P Protip: If you play it, you have to be careful about how you go about killing the boss. You can end up being alive without a way to kill him.<br/></p>\n<p>Made in under 48 hours with GameMakerStudio2.<br/></p>\n<p>All assets made by myself, using bfxr, inkscape, and lmmx.<br/></p>\n<p>Theme Used: Sticky Justice.</p>\n<p>Modifiers: Gameboy, Buttersmooth Tools, Mozart, Maverick<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac9/ac94dd8782f86c5796a4497bdaefb60f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seanzee25"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
