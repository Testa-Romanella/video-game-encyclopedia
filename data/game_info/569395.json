Originally, it is\u00a0a space station 0,22 lightyears away from its star. It takes over one and a half hour in-game time to reach it. Players either hate or love it. I for myself love it and decided to make this little game about it.\u00a0But don't worry:</p>\n<p>You don't have to fly over an hour. The T-5 hauler featured in this demake\u00a0is fitted with the lates in\u00a0thruster technology. This baby will take you to Hutton Minimal in about 15 minutes!</p>\n<p>You can't do much in this game. Much like the original flight to Hutton Orbital. You can turn your thruster on and off. That's it.\u00a0Preferably you turn it on if you want to reach your destination. You only really need to turn it off once you are there. But remember to do so in time or you miss Hutton Minimal. The T-5 has a really good thruster but its turning cycle is a big mess (yes, you have to start over).</p>\n<p>This is the first entry in a series of waiting themed games. Yes, I\u00a0know.
