There are many different levels, which consist of balls and blocks in boxes. The goal is to collect all the blue blocks with the balls, but without touching a red block. The game is based on\u00a0Broken Breakout\u00a0by Tim Garbos but with extra features. There are collectable stars and a time limit that can be beaten individually for each level. In addition, each level in a section can be played in a harder version after all levels of the section have been won.</p>\n<p>There are currently 30 levels in 2 sections,\u00a070 more levels in 5 more sections are in progress. Gamepad is supported\u00a0in the Mac and Windows build.<br/></p>\n<p>Feedback is greatly appreciated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T07:11:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f4a4b0b39f30fc4de9a5a6f38922d37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["DD1990"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
