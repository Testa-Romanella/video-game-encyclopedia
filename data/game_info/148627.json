The objective is to make groups of three coffees and score points. The game is played on a simple 5 by 5 grid. Swiping left or right or up or down moves all the objects in the grid. When a coffee bean crashes into a water drop, it changes into a cup of coffee.</p><p>Obstacles such as walls that block moves and holes that swallow up coffee cups and coffee beans add to the challenge of the game.</p><p>Check out my web site at mindactivegames.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12c3d4aaff3279d25a7b83f5c99ec1dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Cheryl Savery"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
