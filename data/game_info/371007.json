This is my first published game and it was for the Community Game Jam hosted by the Brackeys team and many other awesome YouTubers! Didn't exactly finish, but hope you enjoy! If you are able to, please look at the cutscenes as I put a lot of time and thought into it to incorporate the theme.</p>\n\n<p>My plan was to add multiple endings for more replay value depending on how many enemies you did or didn't kill and the coins you did or did not collect. Oh well, at least it was submitted on time! I'll be reading and replying to all the comments and all feedback is greatly appreciated! Thank you so much!</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: First Game Jam, not quite finished, don't skip the cutscenes :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:59:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/339/339da4dcc26731e511d0406861cca25f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheSlimeElement"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
