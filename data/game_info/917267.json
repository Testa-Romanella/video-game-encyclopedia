But I think some people might enjoy it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the game, you can fly, walk, breath fire (like me), but also walk on ground (early developement). There is no goal despite doing cool trick shots and look at the ragdolling dragon crash on a tree (SO YES DANI, THERE ARE RAGDOLLS!). Depending on your thougths\u00a0of the project I might do updates in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T09:13:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ce/9ce5162f681593290bf846c08e7b83a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Firn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
