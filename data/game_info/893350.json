You find yourself in the middle of a forest with just a handgun and a biohazard-suite left, and everywhere slimes are crawling towards you. It seems, that every slime you kill, there will be more than before. You can only keep yourself sane by thinking of reaching your loved one before the slimes get there. You have to fight your way through the forest and reach the power plant. After you cleared your way through, you have to finally get to the spaceship, where, hopefully, your loved will be waiting for you.\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<ul><li>Keyboard<ul><li>WASD\u00a0or arrow keys to move\r\n</li></ul><ul><li>Mouse-click to shoot</li><li>R to reload</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\r\nTeam\r\n<ul><li><strong>Sebastian Uitz (</strong>https://www.firetotemgames.com<strong>)</strong>\u00a0- Game Design,\u00a0Programming</li><li><strong>Thomas Stadler </strong> (https://onecrispycookie.itch.io/) - Project Manager, Level Design</li><li><strong>Noel Treese </strong>(https://ntreese.itch.io/) - Graphic and Art Design</li><li><strong>Christopher Hribar (</strong>https://hribhrib<strong>.</strong>at<strong>/</strong><strong>)</strong>\u00a0- Music and Sound Design</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Music by Christopher Hribar<ul><li>Listen or download the complete soundtrack here: https://hribhrib.at/music/soundtrack-slime-after-slime.mp3</li></ul></li><li>Sound-effects by various people on https://opengameart.org/<ul><li>Slimes:<br/>\r\nartisticdude,\r\nIndependent.nu,\r\nrubberduck,\r\nqubodup,\r\nRandomUser,\r\nAmarikah,\r\nwill_leamon </li><li>Weapons:\r\n<br/>Gary,\r\nMike,Koenig (Soundbible),\r\nMichael Klier,\r\nLFA,\r\nMichel Baradari,\r\nKuraiWolf,\r\nSpringySpringo,\r\nzer0_sol,\r\nKonitaTutorials </li><li>Player/Misc:<br/>\r\nleohpaz,\r\nartisticdude,\r\ncongusbongus,\r\nAlmitory</li></ul></li><li>Tilemap by Kenney on Kenney.nl</li></ul>\r\nChanges\r\n<ul><li>v1.0 - 11.12..2022 - Game Jam Release\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T06:48:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/604/604710691b7d3185a3cb50112d5e2919.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["OneCrispyCookie", "Fire Totem Games", "Noel Treese Games", "hribhrib"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
