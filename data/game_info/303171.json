The cat (Blue) is my brothers\u2019 (Alex) new cat, and Beaux is my dog. Since I love my pets, I wanted to include them in the time-traveling story. I wrote my story to where my avatar has already time traveled, and Blue asks him to help save his friend Alex because he time- traveled and cannot get back. I was creative with my story and made it to where each room is a new place to adventure.</p>\n<p>What I am most proud of are my sprites and the layout of tiles in each room. Since I have never made a video game, this was a very challenging experience for me. I really enjoyed this project because I have now gained knowledge with this software and goes to show how fast and adaptable I am with new technology.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T02:53:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f34/f346666e69cc2b7d05a0e17f80074870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mariayoung"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
