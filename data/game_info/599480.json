Chains hang from the ceiling, and skulls lay on the cold ground beneath you. You must escape!</p>\n<p>Each maze is randomly generated and has one exit. Your coordinates can be seen at the bottom left of the screen. Use WASD to move around. Each maze spawns a golden idol-which when picked up will show you the coordinates of the exit.</p>\n<p>This game is a small demo for an algorithm I wrote in Godot that creates a procedurally generated 3D\u00a0maze map. The code for the algorithm/function is open-source and licensed under the GPL-3.0 license.
