The next round your previous co_bot will act on its own, and you have to cooperate with it in order to reach the goal. The amount of co_bots (and goals) vary from level to level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An XBOX-controller is recommended, but keyboard also works.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Development?<br/></strong>The current version of the game is in an early alpha state, so a lot of features are incomplete or missing. We are five students who are developing this game in our spare time while studying at university. We would love to release more features and content, so if you want more please show your support by commenting, following us on twitter, or donating. :)</p><p>https://twitter.com/teeth_human<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1db995e49003e49ab85cdaf7973fbea5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Human Teeth Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
