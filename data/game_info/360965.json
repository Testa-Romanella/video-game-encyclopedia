My Leg!", "description": "<p>For our game, we took the \"Only One\" theme and used it to make a game where the player can only do one thing, shoot rockets. The rockets can do multiple things though, like propelling yourself, damaging enemies and pushing health packs towards yourself. In addition the game only has one level, and there is only one type of enemy, who have a chance to drop one thing. With this game, the plan was to see if we could make a fun game, that was very minimalist to fit with the theme</p>\n\n<p>Code / graphics: Regan Taylor</p>\n\n<p>Sound: Benno Salmeron</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cba/cba9d0727ea06fd9d85b5413768a1ba6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["14rtaylor"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
