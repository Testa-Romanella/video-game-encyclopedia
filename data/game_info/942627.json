Our objective was to create a game where the player could experience a clean and minimalistic arcade experience that still ignites quick problem-solving and strategic decision-making!</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY</p>\n<p>In <strong>Breakthrough</strong>, the player will be moving Minos (which are falling shapes made from 6 blocks) onto a wall in order to \"break through\" the wall. A Mino has the possibility of having Boom Blocks as a part of their 6 blocks that act as explosions and helps the player destroy the wall. The end goal is for the player to have an entire Mino reach and be destroyed by the green Breakthrough Area. Players must keep in mind there is a gradually lowering Hazard Area that will end the game if any blocks cross the Hazard Line into the red space. Once a player's Mino reaches the Breakthrough Area, the board will clear, points will be awarded, and a new board will be generated!</p>\n<p>When players do specific actions, they receive points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2 points</strong>\u00a0for each tile the player fast drops the Mino<br/>\n</li><li><strong>6 points</strong> per destroyed block</li>\n<li><strong>12 points</strong> per block dropped into the Breakthrough Area</li>\n<li><strong>60 points</strong> for each fully destroyed Mino (as in all 6 blocks of the Mino get destroyed)</li>\n<li><strong>(600 x level) points</strong> for each breakthrough, where the \"level\" is the level that the player is currently on (which can be seen on the right side of the board)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The player's board score is tallied up as they are playing but is not added to their total points until they achieve a breakthrough. When they do, their board points are multiplied by the percentage that the board is cleared and then added to their total points.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>W/Up Arrow</strong> will rotate the Mino clockwise</li>\n<li><strong>A/Left Arrow</strong> will move the Mino to the left</li>\n<li><strong>D/Right Arrow</strong> will move the Mino to the right</li>\n<li><strong>S/Down Arrow</strong> will Fast Drop the Minos</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Frank Alfano</strong>: Programmer and Gameplay Designer</li>\n<li><strong>Gabriela Colon-Melendez</strong>: Visual Designer and Gameplay Designer</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T17:57:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62e/62e4f0c9adc59eaad8a70229fdf96221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Frank Alfano"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
