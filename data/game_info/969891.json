We've been trying to release games for a long time to prove that our characters are more than just pictures and have vitality.<br/>Our goal is to continue to expand our worldview even after the release of the game and build a virtual world where we can imagine everything. Please enjoy it!<br/><br/><br/>[About this game]<br/>I am wandering through Hemeko, Cho_cho, and P-hole through which I travel through the endless universe using P-hole, and I am seeing and feeling a lot of things. Where else will I start my adventure this time?<br/><br/>When I came to my senses through an unintentional P-hole with one accidental incident, I was in a house that was similar to Earth but felt something strange! To go on another adventure, we need to gather polygons with the power to open P holes. Can we find all the polygons in this strange place?<br/><br/>You should use various obstacles properly and find hidden polygons using buttons and switches.<br/>Also, make sure to use the hints all over the stage!<br/><br/>Please open up a new world by becoming a Hemeko and a Cho_cho for yourself!<br/><br/><br/>[Basic Challenges]<br/>Gather the 20 polygon pieces hidden in the stage and open the P hole!<br/><br/>[Additional Challenges]<br/>Find hidden Easter Eggs in the game.
