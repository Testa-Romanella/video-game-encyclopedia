{"id": 293660, "slug": "circle-of-champions", "name": "Circle of Champions", "name_original": "Circle of Champions", "description": "<p>\n<strong>Welcome to the Circle of Champions.</strong><br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis game was intended to be used as an unusual way to select prompts for art and \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcreative projects. Unfortunately, due to massive hardware failure the game code was \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentirely lost and all that remains of the project is this prototype version. This version was intended\u00a0for use in \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconjunction with a Twitch audience the twitch features are however, disabled as this copy and was never intended for release.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRather than allowing the the project\u00a0to disappear into the sands of time, it has been released here for you \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto enjoy free of charge.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt\u2019s also I guess, a game about killing cockroaches for no reason.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\nThe Game\r\n<p> <strong>Choose your Match</strong></p>\n<p> Each round takes 100 random prompts from a list of 717, after selecting how many prompts or \u201cChampions\u201d <br/> you would like to have at the end of the round, you can also choose whether or not to spawn in a herd <br/> of hungry Huntsmen spiders on a countdown or immediately, at a variety of spawn rates or even manually <br/> at the press of a key.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Setup the Arena</strong><br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUsing the four buttons along the top of the screen you can spawn a variety of items across the arena, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding Landmines and Napalm bombs, Armour and Speed boosts, to aid or hinder the cockroaches in \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir bid for survival.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Start the Round</strong><br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo start the round use the large Roach icon in the centre of the top gui, after the round starts the \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcockroaches will be released. Any that escape the Circle unharmed will automatically become Champions, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining slots are filled by the last roaches standing. At the end of the Round you will be presented \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a list of the Champions and some statistics about the round.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Notes</strong></p>\n\n<li>Add more prompts to the default list by opening the names.txt file and simply adding new prompts to the list. (One per line.)\u00a0<br/> </li><li>The more prompts you end up with the more complicated it will be to incorperate them all into your project, use this as a guide to \"difficulty level\"<br/> </li><li>The game window at this stage is at a set resolution and cannot be resized or made fullscreen.\u00a0</li><li>It is also sadly only available for Windows PC.</li>\n\n\n<p>PLEASE REMEMBER</p>\n<p> This is the last remaining prototype version of this game, the source code is lost and sadly no updates <br/> to it are possible.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are still glitches in this version which can in rare cases cause erroneous repeat prompts and \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchampions. There are also still features that are hardwired in from the twitch interface, including \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIMP STUDIO appearing any time an item is spawned. (originally this was the twitch id of whoever spawned \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat item)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI can only apologise for this but again\u2026. Early development, prototype demo, lost source code.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is by NO means representative of a final game, the screenshots on the right do show features from the final version. New screenshots of this\u00a0version will replace them shortly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:17:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/004/004ebd530d98b907524ecf25a2124e22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IMP-Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
