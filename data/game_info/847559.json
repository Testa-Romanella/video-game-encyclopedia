With all the trash around, it's uninhabitable for humans, but nature finds a way. The fauna here has evolved over the years of human absence and the presence of their leftovers to mimic their new environment.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>It's late at night and you, a small octopus, left the water in search of food. You have evolved to look more like a pile of noodles and can blend it well with the trash around you, but other creatures have adapted to these conditions as well.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>And the area you decided to check out is crawling with giant spiders that have evolved to blend in with garbage bags!?!\r\n</p>\n<p>The weather seems to be on your side though, since a heavy fog has spread out over the area. So do you risk navigating through a spider packed dumping ground to get your tentacles on some tasty clams that the tide has flushed out here?\r\n</p>\n<p>In this VR title you play as an octopus and have to crawl through an area filled with giant spiders that are looking for you. Drag yourself over the floor with innovative VR controls to collect clams and avoid those spiders in this post apocalyptic and post human horror game.</p>\n<ul><li>Gameplay and instructions:\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>This is a VR game in which you crawl around, avoid enemies and collect food.\r\n</li><li>Movement: Oculus Touch Controlller (Grab Button)\r\n</li><li>Interact: Oculus Touch Controlller (Grab Button)\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\r\nCharacters and Animation:Florentina von HausProgramming:Johannes Tscharn<br/>Environment:Karim Jamal El DineSound and Music:David M\u00f3r\u00e1szSpecial thanks for:Hakan Er\u00fcnsal<br/>Martin Viidik\r\n<p>Pre-existing components before the Jam:</p>\n<ul><li>The environment assets were taken from the epic store (piles, walls, buildings in the background, ground)<ul><li>Megascans - Brick Rubble Vol. 1 (2 assets)</li><li>Heaps and Piles-Anil Isbilir-Props (some of the assets)</li><li>Megascans - Crumbled Walls (all assets)</li><li>[SCANS] Abandoned Factory Buildings - Day/Night Scene (one asset)</li><li>One mega scan surface material for the floor</li></ul></li><li>5 monochrome textures were used as base for the creature and prop materials</li><li>XR_Toolkit (Plugin) was created before the jam but tested and expanded during the jam.<ul><li>Already included:<ul><li>Object Interaction System (grab, use etc)</li><li>Input mappings to Pawn</li><li>Wrist UI</li></ul></li><li>Climbing was newly added during the jam!</li></ul></li><li>AI Behavior Tree for a simple, patroling enemy was salvaged and heavily modified from an old college project</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T15:55:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/8661f58e07f0913f1504937582f3620a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["microdee", "Yui", "Karimje"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
