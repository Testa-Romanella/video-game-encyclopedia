I actually originally tried to do this in Construct 2, but I hit a snag with the number of events, so I ended up swapping it over to Unity. There's a text file included to credit all the resources that made this possible.<br/></p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>- Hit Z when the ! indicator shows up to increase your damage dealt and reduce damage taken, as well as increase your EXP gain. This is based on Paper Mario/SMRPG's 'action commands'.</p>\n<p>- You can press C to expand info boxes where applicable.<br/></p>\n<p>- Characters level up at 100 EXP, gaining a little bit in each stat.</p>\n<p>- All characters have skills that cost nothing, but have no action command.</p>\n<p>- Once a character dies, they're dead for good! Thankfully, they can still talk as a ghost during cutscenes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26d/26dec4f4069f278df71fde5569d7d2e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rustfoot"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
