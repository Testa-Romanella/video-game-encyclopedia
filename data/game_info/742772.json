The GGJ theme for 2022 is \"Duality\".</p>\n<p>In Man or Monster, the player is switched between two different characters at regular intervals. The Man character can collect items but is killed by hazards and traps. The Monster is immune to hazards and traps but cannot collect items because he's a big dumb monster. You'll need to make use of both characters to win.</p>\n<p>The platformer components were created by following a 2D tutorial from YouTuber Coding in Flow. Graphics and sounds are from free assets in the Unity store.</p>\n<p>Changes to platformer are:</p>\n<p>1) Player avatar switches back and forth every ten seconds between man and monster characters, with game effects as already described.</p>\n<p>2) Game levels redesigned (especially level 2) to make them more challenging.</p>\n<p>3) Five cherries are needed on each game level to progress or finish the game.</p>\n<p>4) Added additional sounds and made saw sounds directional.</p>\n<p>5) Added functionality for q and escape keys to end the game.</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Graphics\u00a0 \u00a0Pixel Frog</p>\n<p>Sounds\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dustyroom, B.G.M</p>\n<p>Tutorials\u00a0 Coding in Flow</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T08:46:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/192/1929328fd96413c6e275b486c91cdac2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Samut"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
