It uses minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and iterative deepening.</p>\n<p>It's drag and drop. The bot takes a max of 6 seconds to think so do pls wait but if the bot\u00a0crosses 7 seconds restart the page as the bot broke.</p>\n<p>Do try and tell me if u win which u probably will because the bot kinda sucks but I'm working on it and I will make it decent.</p>\n<p>Please, try both red and blue as then I will be able to see where my bot is going wrong or if it's biased towards any side.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T10:48:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/894/894e5d7fc9b87ed6b3f8081f604cbb6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kidcodert"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
