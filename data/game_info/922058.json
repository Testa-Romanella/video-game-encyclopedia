You need energy to build new mining nodes, and it costs more and more as you reach the bottom. Strategically build as many batteries as possible with as few mining nodes as you efficiently can.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0Find Gems to earn money, which can be used to buy upgrades from the bottom bar in the HUD. Your speed upgrades increase the speed at which harvesting occurs, and your energy upgrades increase the amount of energy yielded from batteries per payload. Eventually, resource nodes run out of resources, so be careful and try to upgrade to earn enough energy to keep going!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Once you've found all 3 of the final artifacts on this planet, you win!<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T03:26:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dff/dff22482a7390664409d9740126719f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["chromewing"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
