Downloadable on Mac and Windows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ant Quest is mainly inspired by the theme \"dreaming\". The intention was to create different worlds or locations that the ant travels to and explores. Each level ends with a door that transports the ant to the next location (or level).\u00a0 While designing, it ended up being less complicated to have the locations flow together based on their environment and what made the most sense.\u00a0The project was made to explore the concepts of level design and how to create an interesting game using minimal controls and features.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: Space to jump (hit multiple times to double/triple jump). Arrows to move the player. 'N' moves on to the next level.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Level Design/Game: Sarah Huseth</p>\n<p>Code: Provided by the\u00a0University of Texas at Austin\u00a0</p>\n<p>All Art Assets:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/</p>\n<p>https://www.freepik.com/</p>\n<p>https://www.shutterstock.com/discover/stock-image-v2?kw=shutterstock&amp;ds_rl=1243391&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMImLXZuLKN4gIVW7jACh2hRQSZEAAYASAAEgIqxPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds</p>\n<p>Recolor was done to some assets using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:35:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/876086822a4ff24fb2c9f1e49a347bbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sarah Huseth"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
