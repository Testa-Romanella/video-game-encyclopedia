Armed with only your wings, you'll have to slap enemy bullets out of the air and return to sender if you're going to ascend Mount Malicious and reclaim your honey!</p>\r\nThe Game\r\n<p>Made with love to raise money for a friend in need, Feather Rescue is an action-packed, family-friendly, cartoony romp through three levels, featuring an original soundtrack by Maize Wallin, environment art by Emi Midnight, AI programming by Cyrus Byrd, and enemy designs by Jeiel Aranal.<br/></p>\n<p>Feather Rescue is currently in development, featuring one of the three levels that will be in the final game. Further, there will be a fair few improvements to the AI, some more enemies, and hopefully a cute cutscene or two!<br/></p>\r\nThe Reason\r\n<p>All proceeds go directly to Zen, who just moved countries and has been dropped into unexpected debt. <strong>As a bonus incentive, if you commission Zen to model a character, I will put them into the game.</strong> Let him know you would like this when you commission him.</p>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<ul><li>The game doesn't correctly capture your mouse at first - press escape to open the menu, then close it, and it should work.</li><li>Audio settings reset when you die - we'll try and fix this asap, dying was a bit of a rushed thing!</li><li>Sometimes enemies are on walls? Probably fine.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dc/8dc191dc8b74a5fcb87f41a494143de0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fenreliania"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
