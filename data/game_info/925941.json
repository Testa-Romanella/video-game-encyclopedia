I wanted to limit the programming so I could make a small and more polished game without getting stuck. I then came up with the concept of doing a platformer game where you have to grow as a snake to overcome gaps. Limiting myself to a simple concept gave me more time to spend on the art and level design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T10:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b91dfa3f27ed47214ffaef1665fbcfb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noodle3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
