I travelled to Detroit in 2015 and took large-format photographs using a 4x5 view camera. This type of analog camera provides very high resolution images. In Cineribus, I allow you to zoom in these images and have a different, free look at them and all their little details.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can hear in the background a montage of field recordings made during several trips in the US these last years.</p>\n<p>No real gameplay other than moving around and observing. It is a platform for showing photographs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T12:39:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ed/5ed8e6e52182e91ee8b5199453bb78ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ALK"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
