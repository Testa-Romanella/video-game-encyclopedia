It is just another rhythm game, where you play as a goofy slime, with the mission to collect three golden eighth notes scattered in three different levels. Every level has different background music, with faster BPM as the player moves from one stage to another. Everything in the game world (and that includes you) moves to the beat of the soundtrack; the only thing you will be in control of is the slime\u2019s direction. Sounds pretty easy, right?</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Well.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s not.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\nWFace forward.AFace left.SFace back.DFace right.PPause.EscExit.\r\nSountrack:\r\n<p>LOLO's soundtrack was made by An, the Team's composer.
