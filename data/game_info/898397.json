If however, you can no longer place any of the blocks you are given, the game will be over. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow also available on desktop, its main intent is to be a game that can be played when you just want to relax. It can run in its own smaller window so you can do things on the side if you wish. No time pressure, play at your own pace and you can stop the game at any time to return where you left off later.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay smart and grow your high score!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut most importantly, have fun :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T04:42:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/187/187c39069e56615b548d25fe58862bc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frans Haeck"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Frans Haeck"], "esrb_rating": null}
