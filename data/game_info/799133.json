Using Oculus.<br/><br/>Made a bag of holding/portable hole. There is a portal inside the bag to another dimension to store your things. Press the \"Open\" button on the front of the bag to see it.<br/><br/>All assets were made in Blender. Made a small animation for opening and closing the bag, as well as some low poly things for the inside.<br/>Put the bag weight and tilt to very high so that it stays in place due to being in an open pass through environment. But also added death fields to reset the bag around the environment in case it gets thrown.<br/>The only outside source is the sound-effect.<br/></p>\n<p>Using one way textures on the object and then on the \"portal\", you can see the room from inside the bag but everything is normal from the outside.<br/></p>\n<p>Did not have time to add layer swap on the OVR headset so that you can stick your head further down into the room. That would be the next step together with lighting.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T17:42:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b6/6b60f2c5d7dbad6e0bb605a0cd362de4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IEC.D.B"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
