Accessible precision platformer", "description": "<p>I love precision platformers, but they've always been really difficult. \r\nMobility is my attempt to make the genre more accessible, with different\r\n difficulty settings, accessibility options, and a browser version. (Die-hard fans, though, can also ignore all that and just \r\nplay everything on the highest difficulty. Your choice!)</p>\n\n<p>In Mobility, every platform \r\nis a switch you activate upon contact. The goal in each \r\nlevel is to activate all platforms, making each level a little puzzle, \r\nespecially when you're attempting to score a new record. In the story, \r\nthese rooms are engine rooms on spaceships that you (a repairman in \r\ntraining) has to fix.</p>\n<p>I made this game over two years, in my free time during my game design study. While I am not charging for this game, if you enjoy it consider <strong>voting with your wallet</strong> to support me with making more games in the future.</p>\n\n<p>For more info about the game, or to sign up to my release mailing, check out the website! Or grab the ambient OST by Luke Steinmann!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69e/69ec15c06c3e2832d19fd5767ef147b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Auroriax"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
