Don't let them eat your plants, or else you will starve!<br/><br/>Aliens in my Yard is a small strategy game in which you have to manage plants with different stats to keep aliens away from your crops. Don't forget, though, that some plants may resist more hits than normal plants and could be used as barricades! And those aliens also brought some plants of theirs, you can get at the shop! Surely those may be useful.<br/><br/>Day by day, you hunger will be increasing, so be sure to have food in your orchard at all times, and keep eating! <br/><br/>See how many days you can survive!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T15:43:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a8d247729d14a3850fce87c680fb30b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SirTartarus"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
