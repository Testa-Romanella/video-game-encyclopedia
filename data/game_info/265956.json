You will also find an option there for muting the sounds if you find them too... immersive.</p>\n<p>\u56db, or s\u00ec, is the number four in Mandarin.\u00a0Tetraphobia, the fear of the number four, is in the far east more pervasive and pronounced than the fear of the number thirteen in western countries. Not only 4 but also 14 and 24 and so on are skipped in floor numbers, table numbers, prices, and many other things. This is because in more than one Asian language the word for four and the word for death are distinctly similar.</p>\n<p>This game was created in four days by Patrick Lauser.<br/>Sound effects are from Freesound.org mainly, in particular the morning flutes by Carlos Carty.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy your midnight walk!
