The \"things\" here are referred to as \"boxes\", and since I did the graphics by myself they are represented by wonderful colored squares.</p>\n<p>The top level box has a shape that vaguely reminds that of a companion cube because, why not? These boxes can be moved, but cannot be matched together (who wants to lose one of those?).</p>\n<p>Another square, with a smiling face on it, is the player.\r\nThere are four different game modes:\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>Normal: It starts slowly, more boxes appear every few seconds. Put three   boxes of the same color close to each other and give them a little push to   match them, get points and a higher level box. When points grow, the game   gets faster and boxes appear quickly. The objective of this game mode is to   get as many points as possible. The game ends when the screen is filled.</li><li>Crazy: just like normal, but faster.</li><li>Peaceful: The pace of the game does not change during the game. Objective: get as many companion boxes as you can.</li><li>Race: make one companion box as fast as you can.\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p>\u00a0This is my first game, and my first attempt to write such a big piece of code.\r\nI hope you will enjoy it, I do!</p>\n<p>In fact, this made it harder in the last days, when the game was almost complete, I was playing instead of writing code...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/664d1a6ba56fc3fff89bab3f4986001f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maedhros1978"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
