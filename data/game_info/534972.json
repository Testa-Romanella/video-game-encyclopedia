Each turn, the player draws a card from the person before them and proceeds to: a) make and discard a set or b) roll a dice. Rolling the dice changes your hands, with the chance of acquiring or getting rid of the Devil card.</p>\n<p>Every time players make a set, they must add points respective to that set in the counter.</p>\n<p>The turn passes and players continue till there are only 2 players left, of which the player with the devil card loses.</p>\n<p>Players can also win by scoring 7 points, after which their unfinished sets are turned into a deck of cards.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:42:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d2/7d240107924f348692bbb0fd499c8446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ruchikas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
