{"id": 100168, "slug": "bumble-bots", "name": "Bumble Bots", "name_original": "Bumble Bots", "description": "<p>Bumble Bots is a puzzle action game for the PICO-8 fantasy console. You control a bot which needs to find its way in sixteen small but increasingly more difficult levels. You need to collect pick ups, push boxes, fill gaps, use teleports and more while being chased by enemy bots or the clock.<br/></p>\n<p>Be warned, this is a tough game. The puzzles will challenge your problem solving skills and the action your reflexes and agility. I expect only a minority of players to reach the end, but if you do, I think you'll find the experience a fun and rewarding one. Feel free to share in the comments below how far you got.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The game is self-explanatory. You will encounter new elements and learn new tricks as you go along.</p>\n<p>Use\u00a0, the Z key on your keyboard,\u00a0to go to the next screen. During the game, you only need the arrow keys to move and turn.</p>\n<p>The game keeps track of your progress. When you start a new game, you can skip the levels you already completed.
