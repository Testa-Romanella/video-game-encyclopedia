Your goal to try and create a balanced, sustainable ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Buddies and dutties eat plants. Rummies eat plants or detritus.</p>\n<p>Borgs eat buddies and dutties. Corgs eat dutties and rummies.</p>\n<p>Bungees eat borgs and corgs.<br/></p>\n<p>Plants spawn in random increments of time. If no detritus is being recycled (eaten) or if there are too few plants, they will spawn less and eventually die off completely.</p>\n<p>If an animal eats enough food, it will spawn another of itself. If it cannot eat in enough time, it will die naturally and turn into detritus.</p>\n\n<p>To win, you must have your ecosystem survive at least 60 seconds with at least 1 of every animal still alive. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits (also in the game):<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made in GDevelop5</p>\n<p>Art made in Piskel<br/></p>\n<p>Music and Sound from zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>Made for GMTK Game Jam 2021</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to \u00a0Andi and Frankie for encouraging me :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f9/2f91faaa85726431a407f81c05989eda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jamfizz"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
