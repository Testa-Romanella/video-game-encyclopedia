They are machines, their origins lost to history and their memories even hazier than other Beacons. Their bodies speak to purposes as warriors, but why and to what end? Where did they come from? Who made them? The Lighthouse has taken them in and in exchange they fight to defend those they once were.\u00a0They are <strong>Eidolons</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>LIGHT: Uploaded\u00a0</strong>is a fan-created module for\u00a0Spencer Campbell's rules-lite sci-fi RPG LIGHT. It introduces several new concepts to LIGHT:</p>\n<ul><li>A new playable\u00a0<strong>species\u00a0</strong>- the mechanical, undying Eidolons.</li><li><strong>Traits</strong>, abilities that can be used before or during a Strike unique to each species.</li><li><strong>Tags</strong>, a form of skills that each character gains by choosing a unique set of Origins, Memories, and Beliefs. Tags can provide a bonus die on any action they apply to. As characters grow and change, these tags can be altered to reflect that growth.</li><li><strong>Mastaba, the Rimed Forge</strong>, a briefly-described location which can be added to your game and visited or fleshed out at the GM's discretion.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>LIGHT: Awakening</strong>\u00a0was created for the\u00a0#LightJam\u00a0in December, 2020.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:51:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/7738af4899ce3bf6fbb677ef9c0e26c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Color Spray Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
