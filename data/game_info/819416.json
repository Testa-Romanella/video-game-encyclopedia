It was really tough to make anything in two days, but the result is somewhat decent I would say.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\nA - strafe left, D - strafe right, Space - Jump, ESC - main menu.\r\n</p>\n<p>Rules:\r\n</p>\n<p>Bumping into object either increases or decreases your dice value (black number in the middle). Truck=3 points, Green building=2, white=1, hitting the ground reduces the value by 1 point.\r\n</p>\n<p>The task is to reach the dice value that is requested in the top left corner.\r\n</p>\n<p>You die if you stay in one place for too long.\r\n</p>\n<p>Lore (a bit sad that I've not managed to add anything related to it):\r\n</p>\n<p>The holy Trinity in the face of Father, Son and Holy spirit (represented as 3 spheres in the game, lol) play D&amp;D as Paladin, Necromancer and Priest. They love D&amp;D and they get the most luck when they throw dices on earth. Your task is to help God to get a perfect roll.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T17:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53a/53a32948bcb0ae6c77b45e513419bf44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Machine_Being"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
