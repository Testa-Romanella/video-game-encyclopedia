The project these characters come from won't have a visual aspect, so there's no canon designs.  These are just sillhouettes.</li><li>Critiques on the overall quality are more than welcome, as I'm planning on making much bigger visual novels in the future and would like to do those justice.  (Although I didn't exactly put my full potential into the art as I'm just setting out to practice coding in ren'py with this... I can practice drawing whenever I want)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95d12a5109d65aa8ebc7a7ef93e57f40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Orange"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
