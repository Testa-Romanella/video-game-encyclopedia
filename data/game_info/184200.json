This project will receive regular updates on Monday evenings.<br/><br/>THIS IS BY NO MEANS A RELEASE OF ANY KIND. This is mostly posted for easy testing.<br/><br/>That said, if people start playing this, please give me as much feedback as possible. Not only do I need that feedback to improve the game, but I\u00a0would also love to include any testers into the game, especially if they find particularly amusing bugs/glitches.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creepybard"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
