You must retrieve three gems in order to restore the water levels, and save the friendly whales who help you along the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left click to move, and right click (or space!) to dash. E to interact with NPC's and objects and \"F\" to use echolocation once it is unlocked.</p>\n\n<p>Along the way we ran into a few challenges, but the biggest one was the time limit. With a team composed of several procrastinators, we found the deadline approached much sooner than we expected. A few other challenges included Git merge conflicts and issues debugging.</p>\n<p>One of the highlights of our game is the boss fight. The final fight \u2014 an \"AI\" that decides between a variety of attacks \u2014 is a satisfying culmination to an epic quest.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T07:42:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec3/ec34aa182bb31639ad07896ee6e34d68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelPAD.io"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
