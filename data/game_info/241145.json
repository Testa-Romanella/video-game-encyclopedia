Immerse yourself in a new richer experience while building thousands of ships to reach Xanadu. <br/><br/>The MatchyGotchy cast is back, including Matchy Star, Spacey Galaxy, Pirate Planet, Loony Lander, Guru Moon, Speedy Sputnik and Doctor UFO. These Stars need your love so they can build ships, reach Xanadu, and become the rocket surgeons they always wanted to be. Look after your Stars' food, health, cleaning, games, and important selfie every other day. The better you take care of your Stars, the more productive they are and the faster they level. With four life stages: smol egg, tiny baby, awkward teen, and rocket surgeon adult, make sure to cycle through the activities to boost your Stars' productivity. They need your guidance to grow and work to visit Xanadu\u2019s legendary Space Water Park, BIG X!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Starbase\u2019s interdimensional ship building laboratory is full of new surprises.
