The facility is heavily guarded, so you will have to sneak past the security to gain your freedom. Good luck...</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD / Arrow keys - walk</li><li>Left mouse button / Space - punch</li><li>1, 2, 3 - consume a pill</li></ul>\n<p>In the facility you will find pills, which you can take to enhance your abilities. But every experimental drug has an unwanted side effect.</p>\n<p>Pill types:</p>\n<ul><li>healing (red) - heals 15 HP</li><li>speed boost (yellow) - makes you go faster</li><li>toxic fart (green) - stuns enemies in a small radius around you</li><li>invisibility (light blue) - turns you invisible to enemies</li><li>invincibility (purple) - makes you invincible for short period of tim</li></ul>\n<p>Side effects:</p>\n<ul><li>ouch - you lose some health</li><li>speed debuff - makes you go slower</li><li>sneezing - alerts enemies around you of your position</li><li>dizziness - inverts your controls</li><li>vulnerability - you lose twice as much health when hit</li></ul>\n<p>We haven't managed to implement an actual ending, so you can pretend there's a \"You win\" screen when you reach the final room. This is more of a rough demo than a finished game, but we hope you enjoy it anyway :)<br/></p>\n<p>If you're interested you can check out a spritesheet animation library we made specifically for the jam here: https://github.com/BigNtertainment/bevy-spritesheet-animation We plan on finishing it and releasing it on crates.io now that the jam is over.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:01:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caa/caa8196bcd4fc14fe0c0d3d3baded12b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BigNtertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
