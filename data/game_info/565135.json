There are\u00a0 two different endings depending on how many books you collected.</p>\n<p>The game mixes simple platforming with\u00a0 puzzle mechanics and takes about 20-30 minutes to complete for the first time.</p>\n<p>I am a 20 years old game design student from Germany and this is my first real game. It was made entirely by myself (design, programming, music and sounds) within 3 months.\u00a0 You can play it for free or leave a small donation if you really want to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feedback or opinions about the game are very welcome.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I hope you have fun playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:43:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4c/f4c84c7defbb4e079d2e6a64f9226702.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wardius"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
