Becoming street smart allows for learning, understanding, and developing awareness of dangerous situations.\u00a0The life lessons developed while interacting with the \"Street Smart Game\" app are invaluable tools of protection to develop the awareness required to become a part of your child's equipment for a good life.<br/><br/>The mission of Street Smart LLC is to:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0Educate children about how to avoid being victimized by a childhood predator.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0Educate parents on how to teach their children good safety habits.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0Involve families and allow for a safe interaction while children learn how to be aware of their surroundings.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0Identify potential dangers that exist in the world today.<br/><br/>I hope you see the value of our mission to raise awareness of stranger danger, to arm children with the tools they need to recognize unsafe situations, and to become \"STREET SMART\".", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T02:07:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b5/1b5759507cc72857787c1180b6ffca64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Rosemarie Thompson"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Rosemarie Thompson"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
