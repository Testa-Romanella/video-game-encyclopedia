A solution was found but not in time. And now the facility holding the solution lays quiet and formant ... until you arrived. Find the fragments and restore the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Fragments</strong>\u00a0is the seventh chapter in my <strong>One day at a time</strong> series.\u00a0The series\u00a0was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:</p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order. <strong>Fragments </strong>is based on the 2014 Global Game Jam theme of \"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:11:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d3/3d3bd8986fb40d9138a9b56ac1a879fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
