{"id": 967016, "slug": "ultimate-challenge", "name": "Ultimate Challenge", "name_original": "Ultimate Challenge", "description": "There are 7 works in the Stellar Echoes series, each of which has a different gameplay. Ultimate Challenge is one of the sequels. As a recruit of the Interstellar Administration, the player goes to the target planet to complete the final mission and obtain the interstellar medal. This time we reconstructed and upgraded the Qingzhou spacecraft under the URP rendering pipeline, making the experience smoother and the scene more realistic. The gameplay has also been greatly updated, completely abandoning the level map of the EA version. StellarEchoes:UltimateChallenge also has a DLC content worth looking forward to that will be launched recently.<br/>\r\nThe setting in the game is relatively simple, this is the last test to become the Interstellar Authority, you can use more weapons than ever before, such as shotguns, two-handed guns, explosive grenades, etc., to go to the target planet to take down powerful enemies. The battle scene is three-layered, for example, standing on the second layer can hit the first layer, but not the other way around. In short, it will be a crazy battle, see the interstellar badge, it is waiting for you to light up in the light boat.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T04:43:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7d/d7da35055f7eab610eac147dd5e569ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 507, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LI YIN"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LI YIN"], "esrb_rating": null}
