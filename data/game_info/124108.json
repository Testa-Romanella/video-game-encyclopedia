It's made in the style of One Night at Flumpty's and is not taken seriously. The game is free to download! I hope you enjoy the game around McBobby, a red chubby \"thing\" and his friends!</p><p>Can you survive the night?</p><p>Close the door with ENTER and light the hallway with SPACE. But don't close the door for too long... or \"The Crawler\" becomes active. When he is in your office, your door opens, and you will probably die.</p><p>Contains satire. Take it with humour!!</p><p><strong>WARNING<br/></strong></p><p><strong>If you have a screen resolution of 1920x1080 and up download the normal version!
