You control Pumpkin Man, a humanoid pumpkin thing animated by occult forces on a quest to discover why things are so creepy. And you vomit candy corn. On your way you can unlock additional playable characters to challenge the world of Halloween Forever.<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tAdventure through five weird, spooky worlds in search of your destiny. Meet chainsaw maniacs, undead sorcerers, spooky bats, and lots of skeletons on your way. Ten fearsome bosses will stand in your way! Can you survive the horrors that await you within these spooky tombs?\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI started work on Halloween Forever in the Summer of 2014 and it's finally complete! It is also my first full game created in Gamemaker. All artwork and animations were created using Photoshop. Halloween Forever supports play using both keyboard and usb gamepad. Check back for updates here as I'll try to keep this version up to date with any future Steam updates that take place.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRobert Mostyn made the chiptune soundtrack for Halloween Forever. If you like the music you should check out more of his work: \r\n\tbclikesyou.bandcamp.com\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThanks again for checking out my game. I love Halloween and wish it could never end.
