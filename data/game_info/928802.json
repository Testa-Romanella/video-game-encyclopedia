{"id": 928802, "slug": "stardust-exile", "name": "Stardust Exile", "name_original": "Stardust Exile", "description": "Stardust Exile is a space RTS game set in the Milky Way galaxy, containing currently known stars and exoplanets with their real characteristics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Create your own spaceship designs with an in-game procedural spaceship generator to give your fleet a unique look.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Spaceships visuals do not change their stats. This way players won't have to use ships they don't like because of superior stats.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The galaxy is populated with known stars and exoplanets and the rest with procedurally generated systems. The total number of star systems is 200,418,611,014 counted with a script. This value is based on the current estimated number of stars in our galaxy. You can explore and control star systems and rename stars and planets that you control outside of the Solar System.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Early Access phase will include only the MMORTS mode. A Single-player mode (Skirmish) and player-driven markets will be added during the Early Access and before the initial release. Players are also encouraged to suggest new features to be added during the Early Access.<br/><br/>In the MMORTS mode, all players are in the same universe, and the world is persistent. You compete with other players to take back the Solar System and end your exile. Players can always retreat to the periphery to regain strength and rebuild their fleets as needed.<br/><br/>Ships keep operating even when the player is logged out: production ships keep accumulating resources, and combat ships automatically engage invading ships. To allow players to mount proper defenses against large attacks, they can build disruptors to slow down travel from enemies to their systems for up to 24 hours. When players lose all their ships, they can start again in a different part of the map with a single shipyard.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T04:48:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/eddddcb2d11a734aa56567b451773ca6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Apseren"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Apseren"], "esrb_rating": null}
