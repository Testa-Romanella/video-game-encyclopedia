With his best friends.<br />\nYou should play it if:<br />\n1) You&#39;re fond of good stories with strong dialogues (especially about growing up)<br />\n2) You&#39;re a fight games enthusiast (you&#39;ll get your hands on some unique brawl mechanic and I promise you&#39;ll be satisfied)<br />\n3) You&#39;re into some yakuza-delinquent aesthetics<br />\nBasically, the game is an existential open world beat&#39;em up with some school sim elements. It has a little of everything: a town to explore, day-night cycle, npc on their schedule, battle grinding, school grinding, mini-games (ping-pong, billiard, video-poker, video-game console with one game...) and so on.<br />\nBut the main thing is the story I&#39;m trying to tell. And I designed the game to make you feel this story. So it&#39;s not about rival gangs, or taking over turfs, or anything. You just live there and feel. And that&#39;s all.</p>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2018-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-14T14:44:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/644/644a4b1f4fbca418ae82ad0300847b9c.jpg", "website": "http://ringo.by-yeo.ru/", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 22, "owned": 170, "beaten": 19, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 11, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 28, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 30, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS", "PS Vita", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["yeo"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["CIRCLE Ent.", "yeo"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
