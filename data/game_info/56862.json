The game was very detailed and advanced for its time, featuring car indicator lights, pedestrians, traffic lights, and a view of the car's interior controls. It may also feature the earliest example of a free-roaming city environment in a computer game. Turbo Esprit was the first free-roaming driving game, and has been cited as a major influence on the later Grand Theft Auto series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/067/06769dfa994972bdb06a3e7a78349b17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Mike Richardson"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Durell Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
