Inspired by the works of Jack Kerouac and the films of David Lynch, Amerivana takes place on a mysterious ghost train gliding through the wheat fields of some kind of world. You'll find some interesting characters along the way, each with their own interesting thoughts and non sequiturs.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There's no real point to the game, just enjoy the ride, and maybe say hi to the conductor. He actually has to double as the house band since they're short on staff...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This game was made with Bitsy, a pixel-based game engine created by\u00a0Adam LeDoux.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7c/d7cfef18cb2f6347bcd15616c74421b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Ciccone"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
