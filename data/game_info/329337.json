{"id": 329337, "slug": "lunesta", "name": "Lunesta", "name_original": "Lunesta", "description": "<p>Lunesta is a game where you purchase gladiators. The idea is you don't have enough coin to buy all three playable characters, so you pick one, and purchase more later when you can afford it.<br/></p>\n<p>The characters are composite layers of body parts programmed to animate based on states. The animations are programmed with rotation and displacement.</p>\n<p>The controls are simple - Spacebar is attack, any Shift is block, left and right are movement.<br/></p>\n<p>When you commit to an attack, the game teleports you back to the origin or your base. At this stage you can attack a target. Once I develop the first NPC the player will have to strategically battle for the center of the board to earn coin bonus as the roudns progress, and defeat the opponent in combat before the time runs out. A match which goes beyond the time limit results in a pass fail with the GM which will be based on how well you kept the center out of the NPC control. I will try an adaptation with controllers for 2 player local.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T05:25:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b88dd5f4f9f983d044cb1c29f782fdb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yogentelevision"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
