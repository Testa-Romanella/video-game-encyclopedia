Your consciousness will be downloaded into the craft of your choosing, and you will be inserted into a critical mainframe.  Your mission is to eradicate other infected Nano.crafts' and to ultimately hunt down the central virus unit and destroy it.<br/><br/>Death is no longer a problem, you will have as many backup crafts as you need to complete your mission.<br/><br/>Your Nano.craft's systems and weaponry are fully customizable, giving you complete control over how your craft will perform.<br/><br/>You will need to collect data by destroying infected Nano.crafts' to be able to update your crafts systems and weaponry.<br/><br/>On completion of your mission, you will be well rewarded, and gain the status of Nano.wars Champion.<br/><br/><br/><strong>What is Nano.wars</strong><br/><br/>Nano.wars is a game developed and publish by a solo indie developer.  <br/><br/>There is only one level, it is very large and open world, and game time till mission completion can be as long as it takes to find the Central Virus Unit, which could be from 10-100 hrs.<br/><br/>It's environment is procedually generated, as are the generation rules, resulting in a near infinite amount of different level layouts and combinations.<br/><br/>My intention for this game was to make a game that felt a bit like a mix between Descent and Virus.<br/><br/>There are a lot of different craft types and their stats level up differently for each craft.  They also gain in difficulty as you, the player, levels up your craft.<br/><br/>There are also environmental hazards to look out for.<br/><br/>Progress through the level is saved by converting Pyraplexes, which are found throughout the level.<br/><br/>Nano.wars has a very high replay value - no new levels are ever the same.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/><br/>So... do you have what it takes to battle your way through many enemies and become the next Nano.wars Champion?  Do you enjoy procedual generation?  Well this game is definitly something different for you to try.
