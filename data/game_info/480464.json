The visuals and story are inspired by games like <em>GRIS, RIME &amp; Limbo.</em></p>\n<p>The game is planned to have <em>FIVE</em> levels which all are meant to introduce a different mechanic and expand the range of the levels.</p>\n<ul><li>The Mushroom Cliffs\u00a0</li><li>The Decaying Core</li><li>The Forbidden Cove</li><li>The Sunken Fountain</li><li>The Golden Hill</li></ul>\n\n<p>Story, Art &amp; Programming - halconix<br/></p>\n<p>Music &amp; Sounds - Eric Matyas | www.soundimage.org</p>\n<p>This project is created as part of the \"I can't write but want to tell a story\" jam by Charlmes.\u00a0The game is currently<strong> </strong><em><strong>in development</strong></em> and has finished the first level of the game so far, please stay tuned if you want to know more about the project!</p>\n\n<p><em>DISCLAIMER:\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>The game is made within the span of 10 days.

The game might have inefficient programming, problems with physics or simply just bugs for the sole reason that I am learning, if you find some - please consider reporting them to me and I will get them fixed in the next demo!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T05:34:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36c/36c2f9a2c999e1482bff9ce487d95850.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["halconillustrates"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
