Use Spells cast from your wand to either boost yourself, or slow your opponents down, while dodging your opponents abilities. Choose from 3 different speeds and difficulty levels, and set your fastest time on each. </p>\n<p>Free-flight is still available if you want to just cruise around, try sliding down a mountain, or try and catch a (copyright-free) Golden Orb.</p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p>Requires a HTV Vive or Oculus touch (if you have roomscale).</p>\n<p>Launching from the itch App doesn't seam to load into the hmd everytime, if so just click on 'show local files' and click on BroomsticksVR.exe.</p>\n<p>This is still an early version so expect bugs.</p>\n<p>There's no music in the game yet, but I can highly recommend YouTube'ing your favorite soundtrack from a famous franchise that may or may not also have broomsticks in it and just fly around. </p>\n<p>-----------------Controls:-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Broom Hand<br/></p>\n<p>&gt; Hold Down the trigger to move, hold it fully down to go faster. Steer by pointing the broomstick in another direction</p>\n<p>Wand Hand</p>\n<p>&gt;Trigger fires an ability, if you've picked up one. There are 5 options: Fireball (red), Boost (blue), Wall (green), Bomb (purple) and Hammer (orange).</p>\n<p>&gt;Menu button (or A/B buttons on Oculus) shows the restart race and exit buttons</p>\n<p>Select a difficulty (beginner, intermediate, veteran) which will determine the speed of you and the bots. Then select a race, which will auto start. Alternatively just pick 'free-flight' if you just want to fly around and explore the maps. This is very similar to previous demo versions of this game if you've played them.</p>\n\n<p>-------------Abilities-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Each power-up gives 3 charges of an ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Fireball</strong> shoots a fireball, unsurprisingly, forward out of the wand, which will home slightly towards other players. On hit, it stops movement for 2 seconds.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Boost</strong> sends you or your opponents forwards rapidly, in the direction your broom is pointing.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Wall</strong> spawns a glowing green orb that will spawn a destructible wall after 1.5 seconds. this will slow opponents behind you down if they crash into it, or swerve to avoid it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Bomb</strong> fires a purple orb that explodes after 1.5 seconds, or on hit. it will knock you or your opponents out the way.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Hammer</strong> transforms your wand into a giant, over-sized hammer. Good for hitting people out the way with.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>I'm very happy with the way this game is shaping up, most of the systems (for map creation, obstacles, Pick-ups etc) are all in place which means I can focus on adding maps and content now. Yes, I am planning on adding multiplayer at some later stage, but that is quite a big jump. If you've got any idea's or suggestions for new gamemodes, abilities or obstacles I'd love to hear them!!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n\n<p>----------------Other information-------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Any questions contact me:</p>\n<p>Reddit: /u/_Espii </p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/SamInVR</p>\n<p>Any Support is greatly appreciated!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fdf1831843d0772f17d3e2263b5ddb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Espii"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
