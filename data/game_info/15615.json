While not fully realistic (they're very forgiving), your succulents will require some maintenance and can die from over- or under-watering. Name your favorite plants, give them special care and attention, and they might even flower for you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nViridi is free to try and comes with your choice of plant assortments. If you think it has a place in your life, you can buy your favorite plants from the in-game nursery for just a few cents a piece. Remember to visit the nursery occasionally for the weekly free seeding!", "metacritic": 46, "released": "2015-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T06:50:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/beb/beb0ccb2a90f21f3f0f94f919f27e09e.jpg", "website": "http://icewatergames.com/viridi", "rating": 2.99, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 42, "owned": 910, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 54, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 47, "ratings_count": 77, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 77, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ice Water Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ice Water Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
