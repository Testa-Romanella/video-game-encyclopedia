There are 30\u00a0levels in this version and many more you can create or download, along with a rudimentary level editor. \u00a0Marble Marcher also\u00a0has\u00a0an active\u00a0speedrunning community.\u00a0 MMCE is in a constant state of development and new features are being added all the time, you can help improve the game by contributing to the GitHub repository.<br/>Just as the original Marble Marcher the game is particularly GPU heavy, but nonetheless it is optimized to run about 100% to 200% faster with the same resolution and also has customisable graphics settings.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>Compared to the original in the current version of MMCE the following features have been added:</p>\n<ul><li>New flexible graphics engine which heavily uses compute shaders and allows writing custom shaderpacks.</li><li>Redesigned animated interface. A modular interface was build to allow adding new menus in the future.</li><li>Custom level support with a rudimentary level/fractal editor\u00a0</li><li>Rudimentary controller support and configurable keyboard controls</li><li>Basic\u00a0recording/replay functionality</li><li>You can take high resolution\u00a0screenshots, up to 10K</li><li>Multiple localisations with Unicode support (translation work still in process)</li><li>And dozens of smaller features</li></ul>\r\nLinks\r\n<p><strong>Discord community</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GitHub repository</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Older versions</strong></p>\r\nGraphics settings\r\n<p>There are multiple shader configurations in the settings menu.</p>\n<p><strong>main.cfg\u00a0</strong>- \u00a0default shader configuration, normal rendering with PBR materials and simple ray marched AO, use this while playing. Also uses TXAA and\u00a0supports DOF.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PTGI.cfg\u00a0</strong>- path traced global illumination, trying to simulate light propagation in the fractal scene. It is graphically unstable and requires time for the light samples to converge so it is not recommended to use it while playing, use it mainly to make screenshots. Uses TXAA, supports DOF.</p>\n<p><strong>original.cfg\u00a0</strong>- The original Marble Marcher shading, except the AO.</p>\n<p><strong>simple.cfg\u00a0</strong>- The simplest working shader, use if your computer is a potato.</p>\n<p><strong>neon.cfg\u00a0</strong>- Makes fractals look like they are glowing clouds.</p>\n<p><strong>noise_test.cfg\u00a0</strong>- An example of noise and a simplest shader pipeline, mainly useful for development purposes.</p>\n<p>The screenshot resolution and rendering resolutions are separate, so you can, for example, play in 720p and take screenshots in 4K. There is also the screenshot samples parameter, the more you use the better the screenshot will look(if the shader uses temporal denoise).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T03:13:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f2/6f2ea30ef644f85d2de5e75671d77ba2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MichaelMoroz"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
