Build a game on only one day. The most important reason to do this is to get more experience in using Pico8 as my primary game jam tool.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is not perfect. A lot of code could be done much better. But this will be part of my next exercises in making game with Pico8.</p>\n<p>If you want to help me out for doing more stuff like that, you could pay me a coffee or two :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing this strange stuff :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T05:52:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/488/4887c92c7e7ee3c1ec49f218945126ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Benjamin Vockenberg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
