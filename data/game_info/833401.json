Increasing your weight lowers your maximum possible speed. The maximum weight you can have on your mech is 75 tons.<br/><br/>Only weapons attached to the ARM can gimbal, otherwise the weapon is 'fixed'. If a weapon is fixed, it can only fire directly forward, and can not automatically aim at targets.<br/><br/>The number next to each weapon is the 'weapon group'. Left Click to fire the first weapon group, right click to fire the second, and middle click to fire the third. All weapons in the same group fire at the same time.<br/><br/>Press the ready button in the bottom right when you have finished customizing your loadout.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCONTROLLING YOUR MECH:\r\n<p>Move the mouse to rotate your mech's torso.

It contains the name, ammunition or current heat, weapon damage, weapon cooldown, weapon group, and \"G\" or \"F\" to denote 'gimbal' or 'fixed'.<br/><br/>The wireframe mech on the bottom right of the screen represents your current health and status. Each element will change color based on it's current damage.<br/><br/>At the bottom of the screen, throttle and current speed are indicated.<br/><br/>In the bottom middle of the screen is a green arrow indicating your current velocity, and if locked on to a target, a red arrow will appear indicating the direction to the target.<br/><br/>In the bottom left of the screen, if you are currently locked on to a target, you will see a wireframe version of the target showing damage on each element of the target.</p>\n<p>There are blue objective markers that indicate the direction of your objective.</p>\n\r\nCOMBAT:\r\n<p>Left click to fire the first weapon group that you set up in the mechbay.
