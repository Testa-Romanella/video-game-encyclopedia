Itch won't let me upload it to this page specifically.\u00a0PLAY IN BROWSER!</p><p>This is my Ludum Dare #46 4/20/20 entry. This is my first Ludum entry that i've actually finished, so I hope you will all enjoy it for at least a little while. I used Construct for the game engine, Photoshop for all graphics (except Ludum Dare logo), and audacity for all the sounds ( except main music ).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pet Life, a home for your animals. Buy different types of animals, and feed them and play with them to keep them alive and happy!\u00a0 The more updated it gets, the more options there are for and endless gaming pet experience. I was hoping to add more features, such as multiple animals, toys and stuff in the shop. But alas, I made what I made with the time I had possible. I hope you all enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The full source code is available if you wish to learn from this or build onto it!</p>\n<p>The absolutely ONLY two things I did not make myself during this 48 hours, was the LUDUM DARE logo included on the Cover Image and Main Menu of the game! As well as the main game music, this was made by SirJoan620 during Ludum Dare for Ludum Dare entries. All visuals, code, and all the other audio was done by me during Ludum Dare.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:42:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd5/cd59564560ef5c7f37c022b379e7f85f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ForeverTrash"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
