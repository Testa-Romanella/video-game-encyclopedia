It's a game jam game done without an actual game jam to be entered in.</p>\n<p>I did this same challenge about a week ago (from uploading this project) for another game I made called xXxAngleHacksxXx v.s. EVIL.inc. I had so much fun and learned so much too from making that game that I decided to do it again with Ever Smiling.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game and be sure to leave some feedback! I really want to level up my game programming skills so your comments are invaluable to me ^_^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T12:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aef/aef5528e1e01c46375a9dbb4118c4db9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["kenny-designs"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
