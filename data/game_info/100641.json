I wen't with a rather literal interpretation of the prompt I think?</p>\n<p>Play as one of two dragons, having to rescue the other from a spirit intent on using their body as the basis of a corporeal avatar. This spirit has transferred the brain of the kipnapped dragon into an enchanted hourglass - It cannot be turned over, slowly emptying the upper half. Time is of the essence (not really right now, but what do you expect in 7 days?)</p>\n<p>I intend to expand the game beyond what I did during the jam, so please leave some feedback.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>-Two(!) dragons</p>\n<p>-An hourglass that drips blood</p>\n<p>-Really spiffy fire animations</p>\n<p>-Two levels (sort of)</p>\n<p>-One \"boss fight\"</p>\n<p>-Some audio</p>\n<p>Some procrastination aided in the thing being as unfinished as is. It wouldn't have had much more added for the jam, but what is there would be a bit more polished and the second level was rather hastily constructed.</p>\n<p>I don't know how to have GMS2 export to anything other than Windows, so sorry for that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/082/0821e46ae8fa39df3d6eab11b15dc177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BatElite"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
