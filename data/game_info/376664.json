It is very simple, and it is my first ever video game that I made myself. I used Stencyl to make the game. I did use Stencyle's starter template 'AlienApproach' for the layout, but all of the assets; such as audio, screens, and art work are mine. Over all, I am pretty proud of it, and I can say that I enjoyed making it. I did have some minor guidance and assistance on the coding from my professor and from a friend of mine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4f6ba3a16a636bb49acc523d236bec4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Treylatic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
