Help her steal everything not nailed down!<br/><br/>Princess Pri and the Infinitely Annoying Castle is a roguelike made in 7 days for 7DRL 2019. It features a spellbook crafting system, 3D/tactical terrain, and a good sense of humor. The game takes about 30 minutes to win, and 30 seconds to lose... and expect to lose a fair bit. Luckily, the procedurally generated maps and skills should keep your mind off the pain. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:49:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bf/6bf69ea07d3d484c7f90531128ceb35d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["psy_wombats"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
