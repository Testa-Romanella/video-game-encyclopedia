It's got tricks, might make you think you're forgetting something, Vuvuzelas, a reference to B.F. Skinner, and some other stuff. It's a thing.<br/></p>\n<p>~How did I make it~<br/></p>\n<p>In my wide-eyed student fervor, I was inspired by a remark by Jonathan Blow  where he said Chess played as fundamentally the same game even when taking away any additional visual context. I thought of what would be the minimal form of an action game and imagined needing to press a black bar that shrank before it disappeared. I tested it with some some friends, calling it Minimal Action Game. Then I realized the bar should change color when you needed to press it (it stayed black before!). I made the title descriptive of the game's goal and called the game \"Press When Red\". It was my first game in Flash and I made it  independently of any class I was taking (to the detriment of my grades a bit)  and it was a Finalist in the Stony Brook Game Programming Competition. I left a bunch of stuff in there I should probably clean up, but that would probably mean finding another Windows machine with FlashDevelop in it, and I dunno if anyone would really care enough for it to matter. If you do, feel free to tell me if you care that much, it would be nice.<br/></p>\n<p>~Why am I uploading it now~<br/>I'm uploading it now on itch.io because it's a late night on a Saturday and I haven't really uploaded it anywhere other than on a Newgrounds dump that I linked to on my website that maybe got 0 clickthroughs in the past couple of years and Flash is being offboarded by Adobe anyway so I might as well see what people think of it on something like itch.io.\u00a0</p>\n<p>~Coolio, a trailer~<br/></p>\n<p>Here's a trailer I made for the game on a Windows netbook over a day in my landlady's damp basement that had mold and the stove's knobs were electrified at some point (the rent was hella cheap)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb0/bb0c8f340e395b0d6459672288f0de29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Charles Hans Huang"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
