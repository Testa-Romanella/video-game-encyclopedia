Just kidding - this is a game for everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTHE GOAL<br/>\r\nYour goal in every level is to imagine a straight line that bounces of the edges of objects causing reflection. In that way, you will get that laser line to eventually hit its goal and you pass that level. Sometimes you need to try and solve one piece of the level after another because the line could get very very long before hitting the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMore complex patterns, more abstrack thinking required.
