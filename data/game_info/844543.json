When someone in <em>God's</em> Realm gets the disease they Exile the infected since they only bring problems and makes things go unstable. Meanwhile, They open their arms to welcome the <em>Demon's</em> son into the realm. <em>William</em> didn't like that at all, so he went to the Devil's Realm to <em>make order</em> and bring caos to The <em>God's</em> Realm.<br/></p>\n\r\nKeep in mind\r\n<p>This short game was made in one week, as for the Epic\u00a0MegaJam required. Things are unpolished (mainly animations, hand's model, weapon,\u00a0 enemies and there's no sound) since I was the one doing all these tasks I couldnt do more than that. With that said, I really hope you enjoy the game if you wish to play it.</p>\r\n\r\nHardware Requirements\r\nat least \r\nRTX 2000 series\r\n12gb Ram\r\n\r\nControls\r\nLeft click- fire\r\nWASD- Movement\r\nR- Reload\r\nL Shift- Run\r\n<p>enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T06:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d499ecb92dff065b405afb72619b8f91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AhomiGoi"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
