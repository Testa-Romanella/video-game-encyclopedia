If you're confused, try reading the instructions and tips.

I'm unsure how best to fix them.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>So, the objective of the game is to grow 25 carrots, while keeping the weeds in check.</p>\n<p>To grow a carrot, start by grabbing the seed bag (with [L]), and then using [J] to plant seeds. A seed will then need to be fertilized and watered, in that order. You can pick up the fertilizer bag to fertilize a seed with [J]. The bucket can then be used to water a plant, also with [J]. Once you do that, your seed will grow into a carrot bud. Carrot buds need to be fertilized and watered again.</p>\n<p>As you use the fertilizer and water, they will run out. You fill up the bucket with water by going over to the pond and refilling it with [K]. To refill the fertilizer bag, you need to cut down weeds using the shears. [J] cuts weeds. A weed will need to be cut twice. Some of the cut down weeds will turn into compost piles. When you have your fertilizer bag equipped, those can be picked up with [K].\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, once the carrot has grown into a mature carrot, you can pick up the seed bag, and harvest the carrot using [K]. As you harvest carrots, you'll get more seeds.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p>Start of by making sure that the weeds are under control. If too many come up, it'll be hard to get them under control again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T20:40:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fc/1fc8806daf30437184cfbaecaf674766.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yumaikas", "goomplez"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
