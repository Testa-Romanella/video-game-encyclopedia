Here, there lies a virtual museum that helps the people understand the mistakes that were made by humans leading to the destruction of Earth. You play as a character that has ventured into this VR Museum and is trying to re-learn Earth.<br/></p>\n<p>The game deals\u00a0with serious issues in a metaphorical format by using human emotional traits to paint, the canvas of how Earth is in danger due to our issues. This Virtual Reality experience talks about Environmental issues and how as humans our day-to-day activity might lead to inevitable extinction.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Collaboration:<br/></strong>The project is a collaboration with Product Designer; Nishant Bhokare.
