This is a 2d side-scroller where you, playing as a spider, will have to get through each level while trying to collect all 50 coins per level. If you manage to get all the coins in a world you will get to hear a bonus soundtrack in the main menu. Fair warning though, getting all the coins in each level is not an easy task.</p>\n<p>So far two worlds are finished\u00a0out of however many worlds I make so think of this as a free trial of the full game. The game has a built in autosave so don't worry about losing progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the sprites, sound effects, soundtracks, characters, and everything else was made solely by me, with the help of Unreal Engine, Pixilart, and Garage Band.</p>\n<p>This game is currently completely free to download.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T11:01:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dc/5dc8f75df1200b11ade94a8b36fbe6b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Forbidden Spider"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
