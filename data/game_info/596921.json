I never did. This time I planned it from start. Didn\u2019t end up as I planned and it\u2019s missing the crayons illustrations it was supposed to have, but I\u2019m very happy with the story anyway. Too bad I didn\u2019t have time to add some proper branching so it\u2019s extremely linear.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some fun facts: according to my sport watch I walked 27 kilometers around my house, mostly in night under a full moon, thinking about the story and later about which parts I\u2019ll have to cut out. The story has about 8k words. About an hour of audio.\r\n</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t make the time limit for the compo by few hours, sadly, mostly because I grossly underestimated how much time I\u2019ll need to cut the recorded voiceovers. So, jam it is.\r\n</p>\n<p>Update: minor improvement - added toggles for disabling voiceovers and waiting for click after each sentences in the title screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:26:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e9012dc3e7f3c64218f01b21656b02fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shigor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
