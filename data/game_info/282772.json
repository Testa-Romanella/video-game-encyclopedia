Playing cards can get you more actions (so you can play another card) or draw more cards, as well as do things like attack enemies or even remove cards from your deck entirely.</p>\n<p>You'll probably die the first few times since it's difficult to recover if you don't have a plan of action from the start, but the whole game is pretty short once you know what you're doing. You just need to survive or defeat 30 cards.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46dcfc5c582bee2641ee4583c48c9473.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["SSTRANDBERG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
