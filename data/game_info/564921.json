This is when the game is zoomed way to far in. Will try to fix as soon as possible. However this doesnt happen for everyone. Depends on screen size.</p>\n<p>This is just a very simple one button \"game\".</p>\n<p>It's a coin flipper where the coin can be happy or sad. See which side you will get by pressing \"Enter\" on your keyboard.</p>\n<p>This was a fun little project i made in a couple of hours for fun while taking a small break from bigger projects. Hope it will help in some sense with a dispute you might have had or decide a decision that you wanted to make, like buying a new pencil or something.</p>\n<p>Again this was a fun small thing, hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T02:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57c/57c24629f01f02fb0941ce0ef6fd5e43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pumpkin_dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
