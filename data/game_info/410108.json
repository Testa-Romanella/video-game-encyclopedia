The theme for this jam is \u201cDeath is Good\u201d so I decided to create my game \u201cZombus\u201d (Why ? Because it is the merge between Zombie and Virus... yeah I am not very inspired to find a name x\u2019)). I don\u2019t use engine to develop, only a framework named Love2d with Lua for programming language.</p>\n<p>In Zombus, you play a zombie and your goal is to kill all\u00a0citizens to extend your horde and become <strong>THE world master</strong> . But to be a zombie is not easy, police will try to kill you with theirs guns and scientists won't hesitate to hunt you for theirs experiences.\u00a0 Be careful, if yours points of attack is lower (or equal)\u00a0than points of enemies you can have big troubles. Every time you kill someone you increase yours points of attack and you can kill stronger enemies, so play strategically. To leak is not a shame\u2026 :D</p>\n<p>I make all assets in the game except sounds which come from jam organizers.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Keypad keys\u00a04,8,5 and 6 : to move (respectively left, up, down and right)\r\n</p>\n<p>There can have some bugs, I couldn\u2019t fix everything in time but have fun and don\u2019t hesitate to leave comment !\r\n</p>\n<p>To leave a comments\u00a0logs in with\u00a0itch.io\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/195/19547c814ae14a5d1295ec655f08797a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kynokaze"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
