You have to plan ahead.<br/></li><li> Different materials - object's surface affects movement, like friction or bounciness.<br/></li><li> Singleplayer mode - complete levels as quickly as you can.<br/></li><li> Multiplayer mode - compete against each other or form teams for more tactical gameplay.<br/></li><li> Different game modes - adjust rules for best experience.</li></ul><h3>Level structure</h3>There's no obvious path to follow.

Moreover, overall level difficulties differ significantly.<h3>Multiplayer</h3>Play with strangers or create private server and invite your friends to join you. You can play against each other or form teams. Teams allow more tactical gameplay, when you share tasks between team members.<h3>Different game modes</h3>You can play with limited on unlimited time.
