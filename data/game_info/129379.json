Many of them were about me trying to learn specifics of coding and experimenting designs that were too weird to continue development, while trying to make something funny with it. These projects were actually made two years ago, and it was part of my plan to take this long to go back to them, make them presentable and release them to the public here.</p>\n<p>Number 4 is called FFT. And I confess it's one of <strong>my favorites.\u00a0</strong>I've always been kind of a frustrated musician, always tried to learn an instrument, but never had any talent. So I learned how to make games about music! Which was helped by the fact that the week's theme was a song Bennett Foddy composed and gave us.</p>\n<p>In this game, all you have to do is\u00a0<strong>push the balls to the pillars to get points</strong><strong>.</strong> The pillars are actually the song's Spectrum information, so you will need to listen to the song and figure out where\u00a0<strong>the good stuff is happening</strong> to score a lot of points.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I didn't do, nor I claim to own, any of the music in this game.</p>\n<p>Credits for the songs:</p>\n<ul><li>Bennett Foddy - Untitled</li><li>DOMINIC NINMARK - ON THE HIGHWAY (Megaman X - Opening Stage)\u00a0</li><li>Peacock (Haywyre Remix) - 7 Minutes Dead</li><li>Excision - Bass Cannon</li></ul>\n<p>PS.: Windows version is untested.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d55173576c02538266724244302aadb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["mauriciojuliano"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
