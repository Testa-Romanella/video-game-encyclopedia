He has the license to fight, but will that help him against the unknown NeverPeace, the mysterious bombshell B. Jenet (played by B. Jenet) and the non-villanous casino owner Natrium (played by that one SNK boss with only one eye)? Explosions, car chases, shocking villain reveals and as much more as a fighting engine permits, all happening in \"Casino Chloride!\" (played by Dolmexica Infinite, which in turn is a Mugen interpreter for Windows/Web/Dreamcast).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls for Windows/Web:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Instant Win - F1</li><li>Movement - Arrow keys </li><li>Weak punch - Q </li><li>Medium punch - W </li><li>Strong punch - E </li><li>Weak kick - A </li><li>Medium kick - S </li><li>Strong kick - D </li><li>Start - Enter </li><li>Advance text during cutscenes - A</li><li>Movement during cutscenes - Arrow keys</li><li>Full screen: CTRL + Enter for Windows / Button for Web</li><li>Return to title screen / Exit the game from title screen - Escape</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls for Dream</strong><strong>cast:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - D Pad or Analog stick</li><li>Weak punch - X</li><li>Medium punch - Y</li><li>Strong punch - L </li><li>Weak kick - A</li><li>Medium kick - B</li><li>Strong kick - R</li><li>Start - Start</li><li>Advance text during cutscenes - A</li><li>Movement during cutscenes - D Pad or Analog stick</li><li>Return to title screen / Exit the game from title screen - A+B+X+Y+Start (Standard Dreamcast combo)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional not</strong><strong>es:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>KFM character and stage made by Elecbyte:\u00a0http://www.elecbyte.com/mugendocs-11b1/mugen.html</li><li>Character sources: Dudley, Son Goku, B.
