Instead, you must click on blocks to permanently destroy them in order to make columns or rows of 4 or more blocks. </p>\n<p>Be careful! By doing this, the block meter at the bottom starts to go down with every click, and when it's all gone: it's GAME OVER! By making these columns or rows of 4 or more, you get some of those blocks back... it's a unique risk-reward resource management mechanic!</p>\n<p>You can also TURN the screen in any of the for directions (using the buttons in the lower right, the A/D keys, or the arrow keys) to change how the blocks fall, opening up a whole new world of possibilities! </p>\n<p>There are even special blocks that go up next to your score (called the \"dock\") where you can access them later by clicking on them! </p>\n<p><strong>Every week, we will be providing a brand new build chock-full </strong><strong>of new content until we release! </strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad3/ad37e849448d1c0c4007267a5a3a696f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Wraith Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
