Send your old characters to the well-deserved retirement, thereby earning additional clan Fame.<br/><br/><br/>Take back the lost clan lands and start building them up, taking various bonuses from buildings.

Discover and explore secret places, find powerful gear for your characters, fight new enemies.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Complete quests and find unexpected allies</h3>Do the quests, those that wait for your help can be found both in your home camp and in a strange mysterious Tower.
