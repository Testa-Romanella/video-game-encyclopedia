Control your soldier to defeat the growing alien hoard and escape with the aid of the Colonel! Landing on a desolate futuristic Mars, you'll be left to fend for yourself against the incoming waves of attack from deviant creatures trying to protect their eggs. <br/><br/>After making your way down from the building where you parked your shuttle, your immediate goals will be to collect tokens to help operate the lift system and get to the control centre where you will receive further instructions from your superior officer.<br/><br/><strong>Back Story</strong><br/>Terraforming has transformed the planet, creating a breathable atmosphere using plants and bacteria. Cities were built. At first things prospered, but the scientists did not anticipate how much ice was buried below the surface. Soon parts of the planet were flooded and the settlers converged on the parts that were on high ground. <br/><br/>Not all those converging on the high ground were humans. Alien life lived below ground, an ant-like colony of humanoid creatures guarding their eggs. They too found refuge on high ground, bringing their eggs with them. You have responded to a distress signal from a cut-off island and have landed to try and find survivors. Follow instructions from your superior officer and then try and escape back to base.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T07:12:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/750/750a77c534b0572f0ca578390813f228.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roden8 Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Roden8 Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
