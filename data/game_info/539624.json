The game will be available on PC on February 11, 2021 and also on Google Play Store in the near future. There will be a lot of updates once the game is out!</p>\n<p>However, not all planets will be present at the game launch. We intend to release the game with only 2 planets, and after the game launches more will be added gradually through free updates.</p>\n\n<p>We need your support to continue developing the game relentlessly. We finally thought of introducing the \"Pass\", or rewards to be included in the game, such as a new ship created by you or more in exchange for a small donation, a support.</p>\n<p>There are currently three Asteroid Passes: Bronze\u00a0Pass, Silver Pass and Gold\u00a0Pass.</p>\n<p>So, what do you think about Asteroid Passes? With \u20ac0,99 You get the Bronze Pass, \u20ac1,99 for the Silver Pass and \u20ac2,99 for the Gold Pass. This is a little support that you can do, and it really helps us very much.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for your support!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T04:59:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f519490c3ab0825cc81934585a4f215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Alestore"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
