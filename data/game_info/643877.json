Taking long trips between suburbs I might never truly explore, and how many wonderful things might be hiding within them, journeying between worlds and realities that are only to be experienced through the windows of a rattling tram.\r\n<p>This game is graphically intensive and may not perform well on older PCs, if this occurs to you please feel free to share your system specs so a recommended specs sheet can be made.</p>\r\nHow\u00a0to\u00a0Play:\r\nMouse:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Aim Camera<br/>WSAD:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Movement<br/>Left Ctrl: \u00a0\u00a0 Crouch<br/>Esc:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Exit Game\r\n<p>Your tram journey will span across wildly different areas, however each takes only about one minute, the game is a 5 minute experience in total.</p>\r\nAsset\u00a0List:\r\n<p>Free Tram Zone was made for an assignment focused on importing a variety of free assets to make a cohesive experience.
