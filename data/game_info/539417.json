Beautify your island by adding nature and attract more residents by doing so.\u00a0But be aware! Humans and Civilization have their toll on the beautiful nature of your paradise. Balance the fragile environment in the\u00a0different Biomes\u00a0and human impact to earn coins and to unlock new things to build.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Choose either a nature tile or a civ tile from the menu and click on the map where you want to build the tile. Tiles can only be placed next to each other. If you hold shift while placing the tile, you can place multiple of the same tile without going back to the menu.</p>\n<p>Nature tiles raise the natural beauty of your island, civ tiles strengthen your Civilization Score. Each tile has a one time cost, a cost over time and add (or subtract) natural beauty, civilization and population space. For each resident living on the tile, you can gain money. Hover over a tile in the building menu to see its stats.</p>\n<p><strong>Outlook:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is still in development. It lacks balancing and polish like menus, sound design and a save system. Those things are planned for the near future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T04:08:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29ea7078be60c33d743faa9d9050b0ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pidibidi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
