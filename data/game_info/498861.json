She's so close to everything she's ever dreamed of when her rivals spiteful sister sabotages her.</p>\n<p>She refuses to give up and takes to the town to find art for her gallery. The agent will be back in two months, so Alora has to move fast.</p>\n<p>This was actually down to the wire. I had minutes to get this up. ^^;</p><p>This game ISN'T done. Sprites will be added to the conversations and real endings will be put in. Also the big paintings will have their placeholder art replaced.</p><p>All writing is a first draft, so I'd like to rework that to sound more natural too.</p><p>Everything in the game was written and drawn by me.
