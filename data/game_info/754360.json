It's initial version is what it was like after the firsts 8 hours of initial development but future update may or may not be added.</p>\n<p>Currently the player is able to move, sneak and catch bugs with the swing of their net. Catching bugs increase your points and is the only goal of the game currently. There is no time limit so you can catch bugs at your own pace. There is only a limited amount of bugs.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of features I have in mind to add in future updates so please leave any feedback you may have.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Skybox - AllSky Free by\u00a0rpgwhitelock<br/>Grass Shader - Brute Force Grass Shader by Brute Force Studio<br/>SFX - Casual Game Sounds by Dustyroom<br/>Bug net handle model - Arnis Sticks by DLD<br/>Particle Effects - AAA Projectiles by Holv Studio<br/>Background music - Healing 13 by Maoudamashii<br/>Font - Thaleah Free Pixel Font by Tiny Worlds</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T15:29:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a7/2a7d7db0a68be35cebfa464cfb8238a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PyrotechnicCake"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
