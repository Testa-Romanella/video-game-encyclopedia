In the depths of Rockford Island, a group of scientists led by Ben Broadbury is conducting experiments on primates. Their goal is to create a drug that enhances the physical abilities of a person. You are Roach Craig, a sergeant and the best fighter of the valiant B4 unit under the command of Colonel Paul Greenberg, a military enthusiast with a wealth of combat experience. After receiving intelligence about the experiments, he sent his agent Alex Byrne to the laboratory to get the drug and strengthen his soldiers. The agent arrived at the scene and soon stopped communicating. To find out what happened, the Colonel sends his best B4 squad to the island, led by Roach. But getting there is not so easy - the whole island is guarded by the best people of Broadbury!<br/><br/>The game will definitely appeal to all fans of bloody dynamic shooters, fans of old school games and the atmosphere of action films of the 80s and 90s, which permeates the entire game.
