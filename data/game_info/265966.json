We only had time to make two levels, so nothing happens once you finish the second one. Also, for some reason the text for the instructions/story won't show on screen after building the game in Unity. So included below is the text that should show up in each level.</p><p>Thanks for playing!</p><p>-----------------</p><p>Level 1:</p><p>Welcome!<br/>This little one is named Widget.<br/>Widget is trying to prepare to go into other programs!<br/>But Widget needs your help to test all their functions!<br/>Let's start with walking. Click the Walk() button to add walking to the queue!<br/>The queue performs actions in the order they were added!<br/>Once you have actions in the queue, you can click the start button!</p><p>Level 2:</p><p>Now let's try jumping!<br/>Press the Jump() button to add a jump to the queue!<br/>Then press start like you did for walking!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c96/c9678fb75ed2c763cb06ac85078b9629.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vigorously Rad"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
