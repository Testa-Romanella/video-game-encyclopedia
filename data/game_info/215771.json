When you see a\u00a0branch coming, move to its lane and press space key to catch it.</p>\n<p>Once you have at least 1 branch, you can start to build constructions in order to block the barrels. Press the up arrow to build a construction on the lane you are. You can upgrade constructions still alive by pressing again the up arrow. Your constructions can have several health point.
