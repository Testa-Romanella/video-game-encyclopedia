After every arena clear you get to pick a new upgrade.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every playthrough is something new, make a new build from what you have learned! You can't hide anywhere so better be prepared to face all the enemies head on. You will die, there is no question about it. There might even be some powerful enemies to destroy in your path!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T03:43:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/532baaab26ec3ee6c670af810036e021.jpg", "website": "https://www.alfalou.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alfalou"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alfalou"], "esrb_rating": null}
