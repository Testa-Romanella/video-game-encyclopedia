You travel with your combat vehicles and convoy across a wasteland to find parts needed to repair your broken spaceship. During your journey you will encounter strangers in randomized scenarios by picking up radio signals.<br/><br/>Depending on the choices you make, signals can either lead to tactical combat, text based dialogue or chance based role-play. Whatever choice you make, you need to keep your convoy and its cargo safe from raiders, privateers and other enemies. Keep upgrading your vehicles, as death is permanent in Convoy.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>A new take on tactical combat:</strong>\u00a0Combat plays out in real time as a high-speed car chase where you need to position your units and use abilities to maximise their effectiveness.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Exploration pays:</strong>\u00a0You will encounter many different radio signals, each with a text based event.
