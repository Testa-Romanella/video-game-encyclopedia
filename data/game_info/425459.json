Luckily your\u00a0elastic body can absorb any bomb thrown at you and just launch them back at your foes with ease. Try to defeat as many waves as possible.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Move left: A</li><li>Move right: D</li><li>Jump: Space.

From the right side, goblins will spawn and\u00a0throw bombs over the town wall. You have to jump into the bombs in order to absorb them and shield your town from potential damage. But be\u00a0careful as you can only hold up to a certain amount of bombs at a time. Once absorbed, you can launch the bombs back over the town wall and blast away those nasty goblins. You can control the strength of your bomb throws by increasing or decreasing the\u00a0distance between you and the cross-hair cursor. Once you cleared all enemies of a wave, you can spend your earned currency to upgrade abilities or buy new power-ups and benefits. You lose the game, if your town's health points fall to zero.</p>\n\r\nWin condition\r\n<p>There is no special win condition. The goal is to beat as many waves as possible, as they get harder and harder every time.</p>\n\r\nTheme interpretation\r\n<p>We chose to create a game around the theme combination of \"elastic\" and \"explosions\". Explosions are represented by the bomb throwing mechanic this game revolves around. For the elastic aspect, a playable slime has been chosen which can absorb and launch bombs, as well as reflect them with a special move once further progressed into the game.</p>\n\r\nTechnical details\r\n<ul><li>The game was made in Unity 2D.</li><li>All used graphics and sounds have been made by ourselves.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:52:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/446/446e7a9a7c40b2105490ddd5c5439fcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Andreas Roschal", "woergbi", "BananaBobBert"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
