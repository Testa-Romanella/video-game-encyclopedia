The theme is \"Less is More\". I\u00a0was going to do more with that theme originally but I\u00a0didn't have the time. I didn't even make anything to even let you know when you've won, mostly I\u00a0just forgot. You win when you reach the top.\u00a0SIt's a platformer\u00a0rage game that is primarily purple. The game is just one color to go with the Less is More theme with yellow highlights.\u00a0I\u00a0guess the fact that it has a lot <strong><em>less</em></strong> than I\u00a0wanted also goes with the theme.</p>\n<p>My goal for this jam\u00a0was to use Gdevelop more to see if it's an engine I'd want to use for bigger projects. After doing this I'd say it's a pretty decent game engine.</p>\n<p>The music I used is from this site:</p>\n<p>https://www.zapsplat.com/</p>\n<p>The music only plays after you've died for the first time\u00a0in the browser. Another issue I've found is that the shooting mechanic can be buggy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:13:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c86982c79a1a06b1050616c3d11424b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
