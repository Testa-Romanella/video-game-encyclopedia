There were a couple of unexpected sentences it generated that made me think \"Actually I'd not thought of that, but it's true.\"</p>\n<p>Because of the way I've set up the auto-generation tool I like the way the Bitsys loop through rooms and some of the dialog. There is never an actual end at the moment\u00a0in any of these Bitsys.</p>\n<p>I also like the fact that the characters (defined as sprites) will always exist, but as the bulk of the\u00a0narrative is told through the items, once you've collected an item that piece of narrative is vaporised and you can't re-visit it... so it feels\u00a0almost like the tale is told and you're left with just the characters getting on with the rest of their lives!</p>\n<p>This Bitsy was generated with v3_5 of the tool.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T21:09:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/224cdb9ca50539b0bb7efd1108cdba2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Auto Generated Bitsys"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
