This is basicly an very early prototype of a twinstick shooter asset pack that I am going to release for the assetstore. The idea is to make it as easy as possible for the user to just drag and drop in the models he/she made, put on a gun script and then I have taken care of the rest ;)</p><p>This does actually work right now. You can make cool new guns within 1 minute where you can choose from shotgun, bazooka, rapidfire or singleshot. There will ofcourse be a custom gun mode were the user can change manually how the bullets are going to travel, animations, sounds and alot more!</p><p>The package will be 5$, so yea, it will be pretty cheap. The reason is because I've never done an asset package before and do not classify myself as an professional game developer.</p><p>So here is a little sneak peak on what I've worked on this weekend!<br/>Enjoy!</p><p>(KEEP IN MIND THIS HAS ONLY BEEN WORKED ON FOR 3-4 DAYS AND IS A VERY EARLY LITTLE PROTOTYPE, THANK YOU).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e96/e962d73108f5aff71b2de3bfddcb2e1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sebbsubb"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
