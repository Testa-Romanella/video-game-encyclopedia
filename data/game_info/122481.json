The burning wreckage of your ship - your home - lies scattered cruelly across the surface of an alien landscape.</p>\n<p>You must have come down hard. Picking your way through the remains of the ship, you look for answers, a weapon, a radio. Instead, you find a body. Your body.</p>\n<p><em>Well</em>, you think,\u00a0<em>at least the Clone Bay\u00a0still works</em>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it seems like that\u2019s about all that does. If you want to get off this planet, you\u2019re going to have to explore it. You need to find equipment. You need to find your Beacon.

You're tasked with fighting your way through a randomly generated alien world, trapped in an endless search for your ship\u2019s emergency distress beacon \u2014 your only hope to signal for rescue after crash landing.</p>\n<p>In your search you\u2019ll not only find weapons and items to help you; you\u2019ll also be collecting DNA from the enemies you defeat. When you inevitably die, you\u2019re given the opportunity to integrate the DNA you've collected into your genome, allowing you to alter your statistics and gain gameplay-altering physical mutations for your next clone's life.</p>\n<p>Beacon aims to combine fast, frenetic action with ambient exploration, giving the player a rich world to scavenge on their mission to find rescue.</p>\n<p>This First Access release will give you a glimpse into the early stage of Beacon's development \u2013 this is not the finished version of the game, and as such there will be bugs and gameplay issues that arise as you play. We're hoping that, with your participation in the development message board, together we can push Beacon towards its final release. For this reason, we're initially limiting the amount of keys available for purchase, with more being released as required.<br/></p>\n<p>All purchases of the game through Itch.io will also receive a Steam key for the game upon full release.</p>\n<p>\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac</p>\r\nFirst Access Content\r\n<p>Over our First Access we plan to release major content updates every 4-6 weeks, with minor updates and quality of life fixes inbetween.

Having grown up in the backwaters of civilised space, Freja always dreamed of adventure. Enrolling in the military at a young age, she quickly discovered both her natural abilities for combat and piloting spacecraft, and her inability to work within the strict regimen of the armed forces. Freja lives and works aboard her ship, the <em>Ouroboros</em> \u2013 a single-berth, heavily-modified light spacecraft that boasts state-of-the-art weaponry and facilities.</p>\n<p>As Freja continues to struggle searching for her Beacon, new questions arise; just how many copies of Freja really are there? How long has she actually been here on the planet, stuck in an infinite cycle of survival? Freja\u2019s sanity, her humanity, and the question of what remains of it, will underscore the entire narrative.<br/></p>\n<p>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500<br/></p>\r\nKovus-18\r\n\n<p>The planet you've crashed on is unfamiliar. The\u00a0only information available is its name \u2013 Kovus-18 \u2013 as it flashes up\u00a0on your Visorsys OS; the rest of the record is blank. It seems that either nothing is\u00a0known about it, or whatever <em>was</em> known has been scrubbed from the database. Multiple factions populate its surface, each seemingly at war with the others, and all of them hostile to the planet's newest inhabitant\u2026 you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p>\r\nDNA and Mutations\r\n<p>DNA is the core of Beacon\u2019s gameplay loop. Through the use of Freja\u2019s state-of-the-art Clone Bay and DNA dropped by deceased enemies, upon death you\u2019re given the opportunity to alter your genetic makeup, changing your statistics before a fresh clone is \u2018printed\u2019 back at the beginning of the game. Each faction has their own set of unique DNA and mutations, allowing you to become a battle-hardened mass of metal, a luminous abomination of insect flesh, or anything inbetween.</p>\n\n<p>After you\u2019re finished with the reconstitution process, your fresh clone body will be printed out of the Clone Bay back at your ship\u2019s wreckage, ready for another attempt at searching for the Beacon.</p>\n<p>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p>\r\nArsenal\r\n<p>One of the most important aspects of a roguelite is loot. In Beacon, there are five main item types that will aid you in your battle to find your Beacon; Weapons, Grenade Mods, Pickups (One Time Use), Auxiliaries (Cooldown After Use), and Passives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each faction in the game has its own diverse set of items and weapons influenced by their unique technological preferences and aesthetics. For example, the robotics-focused Prism faction prefers to make use of sonic and tesla technology, while the insectoid Solus make use of acid and blinding light.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p>\n<p>MONOTHETIC \u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Website\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twitter \u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0YouTube \u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SoundCloud</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b8/4b82bf8cf0fb307675b5d34fba339848.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monothetic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
