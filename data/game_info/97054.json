This update covers the many awesome changes I've made on the Steam version. Includes the entire Cult of the Dragon King expansion, which has more floor events, a new playable character class, thief shoplifting abilities, 400 total items, secret walls, more monsters, a handy tutorial, and oh I forget just tons of crap!<br/></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Story: <br/><br/>You're a kid. Who's gray. With rabbit ears. <br/><br/>People have been grumbling about the goings-on below town. Seems there's some sort of magic lantern that's throwing the whole joint into chaos. Yeah, that's what I said too! Full of it, they gotta' be, right? Turns out- not so much.. <br/><br/>So.. What's it you do again, kid? Warrior? Thief? Wizard? Cleric? Cultist??!<br/>OH! A lawyer!? <br/><br/>Hahaha, well you sure had me fooled there for a while.. little jerk.. <br/><br/>Here's what you're gonna' do: Head below town, JUST FOR ME, and see what the hell that Lantern's on about. They tell me it turns all kinds of colors, and each color changes the rules. <br/><br/>How so!? What am I, an electrician?!? <br/>That's up to you to find out! <br/><br/>And so you did! <br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>Equin: The Lantern is my fun little roguelike with some wholly original ideas. Conquer the 50 floor dungeon and its evil inhabitants in a quest to the bottom of the joint to find the mysterious lantern itself. With features like a turn-based 1st person battle system, Auto Killing weaker enemies, an XP Hit Streak bonus, hundreds of weapons and armor to find, diabolical floor events to shake things up, a lantern who screws with the rules, and oh yeah- PERMADEATH BABY, this is the game for those who like a good challenge. <br/><br/>STRATEGERIZE by slamming doors in your enemy's face to lock them in a room, or lead them into a web and trap their stank asses. Watch out for stronger champ versions though and much stronger bosses at every turn! <br/><br/>NOTE: This time around I got some help from the fantasic Rocco W and his sick 8-bit tunes! They were so good I decided to scrap all my own music except for the title theme.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ca/2cac81ff48749d5e1c24923df91fbda6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Del_Duio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
