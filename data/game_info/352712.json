Game should later reflect our everyday life routines and importance of our day-to-day tasks towards people we care by discovering new activities to do in the galaxy like bringing back home lost small rockets, picking up lost parts, fixing broken planets and so on :)). So far it's just a prototype, but I tried already to reflect the atmosphere of the game as much as possible in this one week. At was a big surprise that I was able to put this game on this Jam, it's just a mere coincidence. :))\u00a0(ALT+F4 to quit the game (so far ^^)).</p>\n<p>Very important!
