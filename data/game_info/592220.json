The point of the game is simple: kill all enemy units and don't get your units get killed too.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play.</strong></p>\n<p>There are 4 units types: knights, archers, spearmans and catapults. Each of unit have other amount of health, damage, moves, that it can make at one turn and paterns of move\u00a0(you can see all paterns by clicking one of the left-up corner buttons). When it's your turn (blue/left side begins) you can pick one of your units and move it or attack enemy unit, if it's in range (enemy unit health will be reduced by attacking unit damage). Remember, that when you pick unit, you can't pick another, so choose carefully. Also, when your unit dies, one of your unit will get more health or even damage, but not always.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical stuff.</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I will be honest: there's propably a lot of bugs in this game. I've been fixing them, but I can't say that all of them are gone. If you find some, don't be afraid to write abount them in the comments. Also it's my first game, that i've maded in abount 1,5 week, so it's not masterpiece xD.</p>\n<p>So yeah, have fun or something.</p>\n<p>P.S If you want to play online with friends you can technically do this, by sharing your screens on Discord or something like this and repeating your moves. It's not perfect, but hey, it works.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T08:36:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e0841d162644532d758fb3d1daf4d73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nevermore27"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
