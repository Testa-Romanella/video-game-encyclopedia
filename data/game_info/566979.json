Also, you can trade in the port.</p>\n<p>Every 5 days an octopus moves,\u00a0if it hits a cell with your ship, the ship will be destroyed. At the port, you can buy a prediction of the octopus movement.<br/><br/>Every 10 days\u00a0the range of things for sale in ports is being updated.</p>\n<p>You can buy any building and upgrade it to get some passive money.</p>\n<p>If you have a trap in your ship you can try to catch a fish.</p>\n<p>If you have a\u00a0papyrus\u00a0on your ship you can try to write\u00a0a story.</p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy!<br/><br/></strong>p.s.\u00a0I do not recommend selling a trap at the very beginning of the game, without it you will not be able to fish.<br/><br/>p.p.s. If you didn\u2019t find the boat, it\u2019s in cell K1<br/><br/>p.p.p.s. You can use arrows/wasd to move, enter to enter the building, space to set new day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T07:41:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/544/54461b7dadb6118cfc8db3cfd3d7d4af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["s_b_c"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
