But not the final game, eh?</p>\n<p>Sticking with the retro vibes I've been building on, here's my clone of Asteroids. This time, I followed a different source for my instructions. I also added a few features and stylistic choices unique to me. So, while this is Asteroids...maybe it's not the one you're used to. This awesome clone features:</p>\r\nLevels!\r\n<p>Clear all the asteroids on screen to reach the next level and have double the number you just clears creep in from the edges of space towards your ship.</p>\r\nAliens!\r\n<p>While I personally do not remember there being an alien spaceship in the original Asteroids game, there is definitely one in this game. This intruder will invade your play area once per level and remain a hostile figure until you kill it...or it kills you. It gets a little harder to battle the alien ship with each level, so keep your wits about you.</p>\r\nHyperspace!\r\n<p>Another feature I'm not sure the original game included, but I'm happy to say exists in my version. At any point, the player can enter hyperspace and be teleported randomly across the map. Do be careful, however, because you'll maintain momentum when jumping through hyperspace. Plus you've got no input coordinates, so your target position is entirely random. This means you'll not only come out moving as fast as you went in, but you may exit hyperspace inside an asteroid. Yikes.</p>\r\nHigh Scores!\r\n<p>At this point, why wouldn't a game have high scores? But really, with all these retro titles I've been making, you're essentially guaranteed a high score system.</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<p>Arrow Keys -\u00a0Move</p>\n<p>Space\u00a0Bar - Fire Weapon</p>\n<p>\"H\" - Hyperspace</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY:\r\n<p>- Shoot the Asteroids and get points!</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Shoot the Alien and get points!</p>\n<p>- Avoid hitting the Asteroids</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Avoid hitting (or getting shot by) the Alien</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Just don't touch anything before shooting at it, okay?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T18:19:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/813/813e5cefeaa0f3ee36fa58e8fad97355.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meter Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
