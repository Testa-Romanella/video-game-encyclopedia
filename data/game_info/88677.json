{"id": 88677, "slug": "picasim-flight-simulator", "name": "PicaSim - Flight Simulator", "name_original": "PicaSim - Flight Simulator", "description": "Learn to fly radio controlled gliders and powered planes in this highly realistic flight simulator. You can use it to practise aerobatics, have a lazy fly on a rainy day, or compete to fly as fast as possible in a number of races.<br/><br/>It includes 28 gliders (including some electric), 15 powered planes (including three control-line), a hang glider, and a quadcopter. The simulation includes realistic models of wind flow, turbulence and thermals. You can fly with AI/computer controlled planes too, keeping you company in the air.<br/><br/>The sceneries include a variety of slope and flat field sites. Some are panoramic, with high graphical quality, but a fixed viewpoint. Others are 3D scenes where you can fly in or behind the plane.<br/><br/>It is highly configurable, so you can create and explore new terrains from inside the app, as well as adjust settings such as the wind modelling, aeroplane settings (including size and ballast) etc.<br/><br/>If you've never flown a radio-controlled plane before, you'll probably find it hard to fly at first. Check the support website for a video and hints on how to fly. PicaSim flight simulator won't teach you how to fly, but it can help you learn - persevere and the sky is the limit!<br/><br/>The planes included are:<br/><br/>Gliders/sailplanes: ASW15, Banana, Canard, Discus, Trainer, Neoslope, Genie, Icarus (DLG), Jart, Kato, Le Fish (standard &amp; ultralight), Magpie, Martin Wing, Mini-DLG, Minimoa, Notos (DLG), Phase 6, Plank (wing), PSS Spitfire, Quartz, Sherpa II, Spirit 2.6, Tigger (F3F), Trapeze, Dreamflight Weasel.<br/><br/>Electric gliders: Neoslope, trainer.<br/><br/>Powered R/C planes: AcroBat, Extra (3D, normal and large size), F18, GeeBee R2, RT Eraser Five, Sopwith Pup, Spitfire, High-wing trainer, twin-propeller delta, Electric Kato, Yak 54.<br/><br/>Control-line: Extra, Max Bee, Peacemaker.<br/><br/>Other: Wasp (quadcopter), Moyes XS 142 (hang glider).<br/><br/>You can read a detailed review of PicaSim in the February 2013 edition of Radio Controlled Soaring Digest at www.rcsoaringdigest.com - \"PicaSim is a fantastic flight simulator ... after a short time it\u2019s like having a real transmitter in your hands\".<br/><br/>The support website provides some information on how to add your own planes and sceneries to the simulator - and has a link to a forum if you have any questions/suggestions etc.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T13:57:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47c/47c0b112238fe1be035a1271bdfcab48_FK0uBxg.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["The Rowlhouse"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Danny Chapman"], "esrb_rating": null}
