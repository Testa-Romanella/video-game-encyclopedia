{"id": 17728, "slug": "risen-3-titan-lords-2", "name": "Risen 3: Titan Lords", "name_original": "Risen 3: Titan Lords", "description": "<p>Risen 3: Titan Lords is the final part of the Risen trilogy, a medieval-themed action RPG set in a fantasy world. The game isn\u2019t directly connected to the events of Risen and Risen 2: Dark Waters but features several characters and locations from them.</p>\n<p>You take on the role of the unnamed protagonist whose soul was stolen by a demon. You can return it with a magician\u2019s help but you need to join one of three in-game factions, like in other Risen games. This leads to multiple quests you complete to gain the respect of your mentors. The story is non-linear; almost all locations are available from the very beginning.</p>\n<p>Titan Lords uses the upgraded version of Dark Waters\u2019 combat system that features sword and gunfights and using magic. All skills are upgradeable. The game includes both land and sea missions. A new gameplay feature is karma that affects your relationship with NPCs. The protagonist can become conditionally good or evil depending on his choices. However, his karma won\u2019t define the game\u2019s ending.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2014-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T16:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9a5/9a55fdeaee5850b0a9f88b8081750c59.jpg", "website": "http://risen3.deepsilver.com/", "rating": 3.4, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 133, "owned": 1562, "beaten": 175, "toplay": 50, "dropped": 81, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 145, "ratings_count": 258, "suggestions_count": 646, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 260, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Deep Silver", "Piranha Bytes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
