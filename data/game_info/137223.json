Here, the celestial hens are living peacefully in groups, taking advantage of each second in the goal of laying eggs and protecting their childs. When, suddenly... Skyquake. An egg falls. The hens are in panic, but they can't resolve to abandon all their childrens for saving one. You'll be alone in the lands of Illydia. Walk through forests, mountains, beaches and volcanos to reach the magical elements you'll need to open the rainbow portal and come back in the celestial world. The mother hen will lend you her power for fighting against all the hazards you'll encounter on your way, with among them the terrible burning hedgehog. This is your fate.</p><p>Devblog here<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fd/0fd5d27ca60b9b36e160ab7400ca3000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lacaulac"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
