And as usual there are some guys you dont like. The problem is they don't like you either.</p>\n<p>Get rid of 'em and get your well deserved drink while dealing with your new backpack the \"Gearpacker 3001Tm\".</p>\n<p>You bought it earlier this day in a dodgy shop close to the Hyperstation without operation manual and no idea how it works. \"It's pack and play\" the shopkeeper said.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this nerve wrecking bagpack changes your goddamn weapon every ten seconds. But you dont have to clean it up anymore. So it was a good deal, right? The only thing you have to clean up is</p>\n<p>your bar to get your drink.</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>W A S D or Arrow keys to move.
