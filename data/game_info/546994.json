Before this one, I've only made game jams games, not that it took a lot of hours, but it has fewer cut corners in it. It's not much, but I've already multiple ideas to improve it, but it means refactoring everything, so I decided to finish what I had, release it to the world and start the other version.</p>\n<p>If you find bugs please leave them in the comments.</p>\n<p>Thanks, Belug.</p>\n\n<p>Made with Godot<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T06:44:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f85/f85a09c2053a50303ac08b0da44a9e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Belug"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
