{"id": 888901, "slug": "saffron-seas", "name": "Saffron Seas", "name_original": "Saffron Seas", "description": "<p>Saffron Seas\u00a0is a Crew Management, exploration game, in which you play as the captain of a pirate ship. You must fulfill your promise of finding Saffron to feed the beloved crew pet, Popsy. However should you neglect your duties then watch out! The crew may well mutiny and overthrow you.</p>\n<p>Each time you play the main level the entire level is randomly generated so that no play through is exactly the same!</p>\n<p>I solo developed this game over 7 months. It was then exhibited at EGX!</p>\n<p>This version of Saffron\u00a0Seas acts as essentially an extended tutorial for the full release. In the full game there would be a much higher variety of missions, each mission would give you significantly less resources and you would not need to do missions in a certain order. Therefore the full release would be essentially a rougelike; all those systems are up and running, I just simply haven't had time to make enough unique missions yet, as soon as they are made they can be added in no time at all!</p>\n<p>Instead this experience teaches you all you will need to know for the full release, and hopefully is a fun!</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any notes at all, I want to hear your feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T14:41:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fef/fef4b3db3702995e956c4bc891e0edc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pandamonium77"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
