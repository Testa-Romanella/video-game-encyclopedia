And the wires are all in the right place. They just need to be rotated a bit so that everything is powered up. Unfortunately, that is not as easy as it sounds. Every puzzle has a solution, but some are not very obvious. Features \"undo\", \"restart\" and \"give up\" to help you solve the puzzles.<br/><br/>Once you give it a try, you will be hooked.
