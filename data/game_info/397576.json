I expect to add the following in future updates:</p>\n<p>More enemies,<br/>More power ups,<br/>More Levels,</p>\n<p>I also want to take on board community feedback to improve aspects. This is a learning process for me and nothing more, I haven't done this because I think this game or idea is particularly unique or earth-shattering. I did it, because I could :)</p>\n<p>I will continue to learn and develop my skills in game dev and in the engine that made this, Game Maker Studio. While this is just me proving to myself that I can create a video game, I will continue to update and improve it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for the download and playing. Please leave feedback on my site:</p>\n<p>www.paddygezus.com</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Paddygezus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T02:16:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ad/8ad25efdea51b724946991e1d5aaba1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["paddygezus"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
