You need to help him on his duty utilizing his two trusty swords, alhemical healing potions and magical signs to combat the dreadful bread men.</p>\n<p><strong>The Sandwicher</strong> is a very straight forward <strong>arcade game</strong> where your only goal is to achieve as high a score as possible. You need to balance between going fully aggressive and pacing yourself with healing. This teeter-totting isn't simple though as every second you spend out of combat, the enemy waves get harder. Played with mouse only. How high can you get in the <strong>online leaderboards</strong>?</p>\r\nTools used<ul><li>Unity 2021.3.8</li><li>Rider 2022.1.2</li><li>Inkscape</li><li>Logic Pro X</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T10:35:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0b70e95914a29d389083244d8a9f798.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["anttihaavikko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
