And hey, if you manage to escape, we've got some results waiting for you at the end!<br/><br/><br/><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT</strong><br/><strong>Run for Your Life:</strong><br/>Imagine you're in a movie, and you have to run away from scary stuff. That's what this game feels like. Run, make decisions fast, and try not to get too scared!<br/><br/><strong>Old-School Design:</strong><br/>It's like going back to the old days of video games.
