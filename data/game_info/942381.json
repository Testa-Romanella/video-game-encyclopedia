In this game, you must play as the hoop and catch the basketballs falling from the ceiling. You can choose between 3 lives or 30 seconds, but you can't have both.\u00a0I have built this contraption with <em>4 modes</em>:</p>\r\nMode One:\r\n<p>Use <em>one hoop</em> to try and catch as many as you can in either <em>5 lives</em> or <em>30 seconds</em>.</p>\r\nMode Two:\r\n<p>It's the same as mode one, but more chaotic. Now you control <em>two separate hoops, </em>switching between them as you go!</p>\r\nMode Three:\r\n<p>Control <em>one hoop</em><em>\u00a0</em>and <em>two</em><em>\u00a0bounce pads</em> (they can either be a <em>second chance</em> or a <em>hindrance</em>!). This is where complete chaos begins.</p>\r\nFreeplay:\r\n<p>Try to get as <em>few misses</em> and as <em>many catches</em> as you can! In this mode, there is <em>no time or life limit</em>, so you can play to your heart's content! You can choose to freeplay in mode one, two or three from the <em>freeplay menu</em>.</p>\n<p>For the players looking for an added challenge, there are <em>8 collectible achievements</em>, 2 of which are secrets to discover!</p>\n\r\nThe Controls\r\n<p>Use your <strong>mouse</strong> to navigate the menus and move the hoops. On modes two and three, use\u00a0\u00a0<strong>a and d (or arrow\u00a0</strong><strong>keys)</strong> to switch between active hoops. \u00a0<em>It's that simple!</em></p>\n<p><strong>[Warning - game may break if played on a non-16:9 monitor. I have tried my best to remedy this but there is no default way to fix it in unity.]</strong>\n</p>\n\r\nHow To Download\r\n<ol><li>\u00a0Download the zipped folder</li><li>\u00a0Extract the zipped folder</li><li>\u00a0Run the .exe labeled \"catch-it-ball\"</li><li>\u00a0Enjoy the game!</li></ol>\r\nComing soon! 3/18/23\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nSocials", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T15:43:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19c/19c80c1b6334eac66c912f87d4f45652.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One Thousand Volts"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
