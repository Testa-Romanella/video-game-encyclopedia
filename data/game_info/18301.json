There are 10 missions for each faction. The goals are different for each mission. For example, the player may have to destroy the opposing force&#39;s base or survive an assault from the enemy. Sometimes the number of units the player can have is limited. The players collect gold to purchase new units and mana to cast magic spells. After the player purchases and builds a unit, they automatically march towards the enemies base and attack every enemy they encounter. The spells can be cast in order to strengthen your own units or attack the enemies. </p>\n<p>The game also features a competitive split-screen multiplayer and other modes that can be unlocked by playing the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-08T08:00:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f10/f10e7cafed6665861c58187b2ae3b310.jpg", "website": "http://www.swordsandsoldiers.com", "rating": 2.65, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 112, "owned": 1980, "beaten": 30, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 53, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 140, "suggestions_count": 329, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 141, "platforms": ["macOS", "Wii", "PC"], "developers": ["Ronimo Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ronimo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
