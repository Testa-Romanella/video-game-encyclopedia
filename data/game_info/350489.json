No gameplay involved -- just sit back, relax, and enjoy the music while you drive through a retro low poly world. Nostalgic fans of the 80's will not be disappointed with some smooth DX7 chords, melancholic synth work and pulsating bass lines. <br/><br/>The EP features 3 tracks, and each track comes with its own scenery, tailor made to fit its mood. You can start each track separately from the main menu. <br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>\u201cTogether\u201d</strong> (duration 3m20)<br/></li><li> <strong>\u201cInnervisions\u201d</strong> (duration 3m00)<br/></li><li> <strong>\u201cPoint Break\u201d</strong> (duration 2m00)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c68/c68f9b79d0b853b89633c6c10b503b08.jpg", "website": "https://www.strydegames.nl/sheaf", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stryde Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Stryde Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
