The theme for the fourth week was 'Randomness'. Which meant that we could choose any game idea we desired, however it must contain some sort of randomness. I chose to create a sandwich making game where each order is random.\u00a0The aim of the game is to complete as many correct orders as possible before the timer runs out. I enjoyed making this game so i might add to it in the future if i see potential.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Download the game and let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Also check out my other games on my profile!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:32:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/778/7782c73237633aa088c801690cb5fac9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Lister"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
