She\u2019s just excited to present him with the cake she has just made. <br/><br/>Little by little, the couple\u2019s areas of disagreement come to the surface and the joyful atmosphere soon turns to shock as various objects come loose and start to fly around them. <br/>\u201cMarco &amp; Polo Go Round\u201d plunges the viewer into a young couple\u2019s intimate relationship and invites them to physically experience the crisis they are going through as they navigate this distorted, topsy-turvy world.  <br/><br/>This film uses several real-time approaches and technologies such as volumetric capture to preserve the glances and movements of the actors (L\u00e9ane Labr\u00e8che-Dor and Emmanuel Schwartz). <br/><br/><strong>MARCO &amp; POLO GO ROUND: </strong><br/>- A film with an intimate, surreal screenplay that deals with love and its fragile nature <br/>- An innovative approach based on volumetric capture and special effects to produce an immersive experience. <br/>- An extraordinary visual universe in which the viewer moves around as if in a living painting. <br/>- A 14-minute sensory and narrative experience. <br/>- Selected for the Tribeca, Cannes XR and Annecy festivals and winner of the Kaohsiung XR Dreamland Festival<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T05:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c6b5bdd0526df5d6059c6440e5ba4a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dpt.", "Item 7", "Belga Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ARTE France"], "esrb_rating": null}
