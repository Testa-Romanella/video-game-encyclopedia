It's a pretty simple life she lives, playing games, doing the same chores every day out of boredom, reading books (and constantly thinking how glad she is that she doesn't feel pressured to do something she doesn't care about doing).</p>\n<p>But a month before the Lunar New Year, something happens that has never happened before-- Chang'e walks outside to find a complete stranger outside her home. There's no way they should or could be here, and yet here they are.</p>\n<p>And of course, to\u00a0compound the problem(?), the new person doesn't speak a lick of Chinese, and Chang'e doesn't understand a word of English.\u00a0</p>\n<p>=====</p>\n<p><em>The Moon Lady</em> is a short, primarily kinetic visual novel that was created for both <strong>Ace Jam 2020</strong> and the <strong>Lunar Game Jam</strong>\u00a0involving the myth of Chang'e and the origin of the Mid-Autumn Festival, ace girls, and slice-of-life.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>CONTENT WARNING:</em></strong> There is a bit of content in the game that contains flashing images. There is a warning for this upon opening the game as well.<br/></p>\n<p>=====</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Story :: Ariza Luca</p>\n<p>Writing :: Ariza Luca</p>\n<p>Art :: Ariza Luca</p>\n<p>GUI :: Ariza Luca</p>\n<p>Music ::</p>\n<p>Music from https://filmmusic.io<br/>\"Night Vigil\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>\"Midnight Tale\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>\"Touching Moments Four Melody\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Music from https://bensound.com<br/>\" Memories\"<br/>\"Sad Day\"<br/>\"Relaxing\"<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Yugen by Keys of Moon | https://soundcloud.com/keysofmoon<br/>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com<br/>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy!
