The games that inspired this game were Diablo, Spores, and another 7DRL Cogmind( even though I have never played the game.\u00a0 I thought i would be cool if you were a creature that ate other creatures and that would allow you to gain their powers.\u00a0 Also, your creature would change based on the newly acquired body part. First, I was thinking to make cute art and the creatures were fighting in an apocalyptical\u00a0\u00a0world. But, I drew one a 1 minute sketch of a dark creature. This gave me the idea to make the world dark.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>\n<p>All programming was done in Unity using C#. Programming, art, and sound was all done by myself. I had some sound effects that I recorded on my phone. During the week of the competition, I edited those effects in audacity. But, I didn't spend a lot of time. The short music was done on my out of tuned piano and guitar. I'm not a musician.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a challenge. I had planned out much of the work before the competition. I still amazed that it came together. I wasn't sure if the random body parts would work. I tried my best to organized my class. I tried to make it very customizable. Still, I need to improve much of the code. I was often struggling to remember where certain code was written at. I created different managers to handle different parts of the game. But sometimes it was difficult to decide which manager would handle which code.</p>\n<p>In the end. I am very pleased with the outcome. I know there are bugs. I'm still not sure if the status effects work correctly. I spent too much time trying to get the stun effect to work. One incorrect bool can make for a lot of debugging.</p>\n<p>For Link to the game.</p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EoPsOspbb7uG4nZH5tC_G1u9h8_iXeRa?usp=sha...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T03:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a91/a919e0ed9305b31b94528121849e5a4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itkdog"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
