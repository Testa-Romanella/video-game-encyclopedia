When you move, a body is created connected the last 2 places the head of the snake was at. Every movement makes the body of the snake larger.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead of moving you can also place a wall on any empty field (doesn't already contain a wall or player body). You can not move onto a wall. Each player has 3 walls so think strategically!\u00a0</p>\n<p>After each move (movement of the snake or wall placement) it is the next players turn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the opponent stuck, i.e. unable to move.</p>\n\n<p>&lt; CONTROLS &gt;</p>\n<p>Left mouse - Move the snake</p>\n<p>Right mouse - Place a wall</p>\n\n<p>&lt; CREDITS &gt;</p>\n<p>Idea: Niko Covic, Fran Karlovic</p>\n<p>Art, music, sfx, code: Niko Covic</p>\n\n<p>Made for Lowrezjam 2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T06:58:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a8/0a80f31e20fbcf3785c62be4e25d0f0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["S-Cov"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
