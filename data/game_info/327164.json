It has over 100 options to choose from.\u00a0It was made for the game's 10th anniversary to celebrate how much I love it.<br/></p>\n<p>This is an unofficial fanwork. I\u00a0have no connection to Radical Entertainment or Activision. No money is being made off this. Font credits may be found in the attached TOS file.</p>\n<p>It is open source!!! This game was programmed entirely in Python 3.7, mostly using Pygame. Please feel free to view the included dressup.py file and modify it for your own purposes, as long as you do not make any money off of it or derivative works, and do not use it to create hateful, violent, or pornographic content.</p>\n<p>The game was made primarily for Windows. It has been tested on Windows 7, 8.1, and 10. I\u00a0have not tested it on Mac or Linux, but you can try running dressup.py yourself if you have Python\u00a0installed (dependencies: pygame, os.path, random).</p>\n<p>I plan to add more content in future updates.</p>\n<p>This is my first full-fledged game, so please let me know what you think!!</p>\n<p>\u300ePROTOTYPE\u300f\u306f2009\u6d0b\u30b2\u3001 \u300eRadical Entertainment\u300f\u306f\u958b\u767a\u3068 \u300eActivision\u300f\u767a\u58f2\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u79c1\u3068\u306f\u95a2\u4fc2\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002</p>\n<p>\u300ePROTOTYPE\u7740\u305b\u66ff\u3048\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300f\u306f2019\u540c\u4eba\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002\u79c1(Red/Beesbeesbees/prettypinkpansy)\u306f\u958b\u767a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002Python\u3068Pygame\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u3002</p>\n<p>\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u3059\u3002\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3084\u5909\u66f4OK\u3060\u3051\u3069\u3001\u8ee2\u58f2\u3059\u308b\u306a\u3069\u7981\u6b62\u3067\u3059\u3002\u305d\u3057\u3066\u66b4\u529b\u7684\u3084\u618e\u60aa\u8868\u73fe\u3084R18\u306a\u5909\u66f4\u3092\u3057\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002</p>\n<p>\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3093\u3067\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/010/01025d5e9f808b961adc06a618e5015d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beesbeesbees"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
