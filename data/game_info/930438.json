{"id": 930438, "slug": "plant-attack-nishma", "name": "Plant Attack (nishma)", "name_original": "Plant Attack (nishma)", "description": "<p>This is a simple, retro-style game where the objective is to kill all of the evil plants. The main player (blue) is protecting its land from the plants that are trying to invade. So every time the player successfully hits a plant, it gains or maintains its health. However, if a plant makes its way to the land, the player will lose health. I was inspired by games like Plant vs Zombie, except here the plant is the enemy. The player loses when its health reaches 0, and it wins when it has reached the end alive. I also used cheese as the projectile to go along with aesthetic of the game. As for the sound effects, music, and sprites, I downloaded them from the credited sources below.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Cheese Sprite: Free Pixel Food! by Henry Software (itch.io)</p>\n<p>Player Sprite: Free Pixel Art Tiny Hero Sprites - CraftPix.net\r\n</p>\n<p>Plant enemy Sprite: Beowulf's Bosses Monsters Walking Sprites by Beowulf (itch.io)\r\nFont: Free Pixel Font - Thaleah | 2D Fonts | Unity Asset Store\r\n</p>\n<p>Cheese projectile sound: Download Free Whoosh Sound Effects | Mixkit\r\n</p>\n<p>Other sound effects: https://www.zapsplat.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Background music:\u00a0<br/>Fluffing a Duck Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\nMusic promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T18:06:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba0/ba0b143fcb4f23659d625283a186d5fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["nishma"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
