Sounds simple enough, but this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in for an easy task. Show off both your speed and accuracy. Prove your reflexes and steady arm by always cutting tree trunks from the correct side. <br/><br/><br/>Become a true master of your trade by setting records and unlocking new tools. Use your hard-earned points to buy new axes that not only make you look stylish against the cloud of shavings and splinters, but also give you some special bonuses.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Keep a cool head and use your best judgement even in the midst of the busiest logging operation: it\u2019s not just branches that will get in your way. Look out for all the different types of obstacles and wildlife, such as squirrels and wasp nests. Act quickly, be precise, and stay alert!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Enjoy the seasons to the fullest, be it a snowy winter forest, spring in full bloom, or a bit of autumn nostalgia. Just don\u2019t get too distracted by the landscape and the atmosphere: you have trees to cut down and records to beat!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T05:31:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ca/4ca5003d0d58e03a7b73edc877952cef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameFormatic"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay"], "esrb_rating": null}
