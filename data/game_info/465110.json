The younger twin, Luna, never had the chance to truly live, having died before birth. Narrowly escaping death\u2019s clutches, Luna\u2019s soul latched onto the elder twin\u2019s body, forcing Sol to share control with the other. Wanting to live separately, they begin a journey to create a potion that would bring them before Hades. Will the meeting with Hades go as they wish?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enter a world where nothing is under your control, and playing with fate has consequences. Do you want to play with the God of Death? Will you test fate?<br/>Beware, nothing says this will be simple. If you\u2019re willing to face the challenge, play Eclipse and challenge fate yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Characters\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The Twins</li><ul><li>A pair of siblings cursed to fight for control over one body after one of them perished in the womb.</li><li>Sol</li><ul><li>The surviving twin. As the true living twin, Sol is the stronger, more dominant soul, and remains in control of their body most of the time. Sol sees only what is in the Physical world.</li></ul><li>Luna</li><ul><li>The twin that perished.

As neither could share their body with the other, the two wrestle one another for control. But with the passage of time, Luna\u2019s soul grows weaker while Sol\u2019s grows stronger. Because of this, Luna\u2019s vision becomes limited to only the space around them. It is then that the pair decides to venture on a journey to the Underworld to gain their independence.</li><li>The journey begins with the twins collecting ingredients for a potion. As they travel to Hades\u2019 realm, they tread through the Desert and Forest, collecting items and avoiding spirits hungry for their souls. Once complete, the twins bring the ingredients to a greenhouse, where they find a microwave to brew their potion in. Once ready, the potion takes them to the Underworld, and into the presence of Hades himself.</li><li>Hades determines the twins undeserving of a granted wish, and offers instead for their fate to be decided by the roll of a die, which will judge them based on the truth behind their desires.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Symbolism\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Dice: representing probability, dice are prime examples of things left to chance</li><li>Flask: though used in controlled experiments (chemistry; laws of conservation of mass), when these appear in dreams, they signify the possibility of unexpected occurrences</li><li>Crow: A sign of luck and omens, sent by the gods to humans as things spiral out of their control.</li><li>Clematis: Symbolizing ingenuity, these are vines that grow uncontrollably, extending in all directions, similar to the manipulative behaviors seen in Sol and Luna.</li><li>Microwave: In dreams, microwaves are said to represent unpreparedness. The twins\u2019 lack of preparation in coming before him causes Hades to cast such a fate on them.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>How does your game fit the theme?</strong>\u00a0<br/><em>The theme for GMTK Game Jam 2020 is \"Out of Control.\"</em>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What would you/your team like to be called, if GMTK features your game?</strong>\u00a0<br/>Monbebe Studios</p>\n<p><strong>Game Mechanics\u00a0<br/></strong>- Random switches between the characters and the different worlds they see subtract from the player\u2019s control of the game</p>\n<p>- Keyboard commands will constantly flip throughout the game, further subtracting from the player\u2019s control.</p>\n<p><strong>Genre</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Fantasy/Horror<br/>Platformer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de0/de054ecf8fa6ec47b1fc515b1c184d43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monbebe Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
