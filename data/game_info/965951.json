Also, please don't upset Max, I don't want to tell you what happens if you do.\u200b<br/><br/><br/>Note: CyberPigeon is still in active development and is being released as Early Access. A lot of things have been changing over the last few months as I attempt to balance and add more objects and events into the game. I've tried to make this as bug-free as possible, but I'm still finding and fixing as many as I can. As this is the first demo I'm releasing to the public, I'd love to hear thoughts, opinions and general feedback on the game. Release date is unknown at this stage. Please remember this is a very early preview of the game, graphics and objects are subject to change.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T02:41:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e4f2bb90260bdb5aa711cdfd32baef3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brian Voll"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brian Voll"], "esrb_rating": null}
