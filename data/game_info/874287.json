Lots of others already exist, and mine will never be the best, but it's a fun intellectual challenge.</p>\n<p>The deadline for the game jam has come so I am submitting an early draft of the AI\u00a0that makes only-slightly-better-than-random moves. My current version is more strategic but too buggy for public consumption. I expect to be\u00a0tinkering away at it for a few weeks yet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T13:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d40/d40a11cc90dc1de51173417c934f3d44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["H.H.Magoo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
