You first fight the gas monsters with your clean sword and then you try to find the source and you find a greedy businessman who is ruining the world by pumping gas in the atmosphere. You try to defeat him but once you do, you find that it is not enough. You try to convince the public to care about climate change. After convincing the public, you make choices to help slow down climate change, such as making electric cars the only cars you can use. You will also make a choice which makes bikes and buses more popular/mainstream. Finally you pick up litter at the end of the game to gather up on pollution. Players can slay the gas monsters with their clean sword but it also follows real life a bit so you can\u2019t fly or completely kill the gas monsters. You can\u2019t convince the public that climate change and pollution is good otherwise you would lose the game. Players have to slay the gas monsters, the greedy businessman, convince the public, make different choices to slow down climate change and pick up litter all in order to complete and win the game. Overall there are 5 parts to my game: Slay the gas monsters, defeat the greedy businessman, convince the public, make different choices to slow down climate change and pick up litter. These are all in order from slaying the gas monsters at first to picking up litter at last.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T20:07:41", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tapperman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
