It's also a tacit scream of excitement for Sundae Month's upcoming game Pupperazzi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The original idea for this mini visual novel was in a Tweet exchange between Kitfox Games, the publisher, and me. This isn't long. But it's free. I hope you enjoy. And if you do. Let me know what you think!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I may sometime in the future release an expanded version with cut content, and if I do, at that time I may also look into replacing the music and art, but for now I am tired, and believe I will take a nap. I hope you find this game pleasing and are well rested. Thank you again!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T07:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26e/26e03210a09ebd78524062a24676b12c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["talconhiro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
