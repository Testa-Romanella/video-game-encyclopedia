{"id": 958436, "slug": "beercook", "name": "BeerCook", "name_original": "BeerCook", "description": "<p><strong>Beer Cook</strong></p>\n\n<p>Beer Cook is a game where players\u00a0take on the role of a chef in a bustling restaurant kitchen trying to create the perfect curry dish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The catch is that the chef's creativity is fueled by beer, and players must manage their beer level to maintain their creative flow. The game could be a time-based puzzle game where players must complete various stages of curry preparation, such as chopping vegetables, mixing spices, and cooking the curry, all while managing their beer level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Too little beer, and the chef's creativity wanes, resulting in a poorly executed dish. Too much beer, and the chef's coordination and decision-making skills are impaired, leading to mistakes and a lower score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Players could earn points based on the quality of the dish they prepare, with bonuses for creativity and speed. As the game progresses, players could unlock new recipes, spices, and beer types to experiment with, adding variety and replayability to the game. To add a competitive element, you could also include a multiplayer mode where players compete against each other in real-time, trying to create the best curry dish while managing their beer levels and racing against the clock. The game could have colorful graphics, fun sound effects, and a catchy soundtrack to create an engaging and immersive experience for players. With a simple and intuitive control scheme, it could be easily accessible and enjoyable for players of all skill levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T17:46:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3aba3d81c1d6742c3dd88adbd933ddb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Krel113", "MiraGames", "dusimgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
