A savage clutch of alien races called the Ur-Quan Hierarchy has become the \"evil empire\" of the 27th century - ruthlessly invading interstellar neighbors. Humanity is next on their list. Your job is to make sure that they don't succeed. The entire Alliance of Free Stars battlefleet awaits your orders. \n<br/><br/>\nStar Control 2<br/>\nArguably the greatest space adventure on PC, with tons of humor and memorable characters. You start in a nearly empty space-ship, but as the game progresses, you can upgrade it with many modules that affect the vessel's attributes. You can discover new stars, meet new alien races, wage wars, and boldly go where no man has gone before you. A truly exceptional exploration game that that has influenced the entire industry. While playing this gem, it's really fun to observe how many of its gameplay features were copied by modern AAA titles. \n<br/><br/>\nStar Control 3<br/>\nStar Control 3 is the last installment of the series. Taking a slightly different track that diverged from the Star Control 2 formula, it got excellent reviews though some of the hardcore Star Control fans weren't entirely thrilled by the innovations. Journalists, new fans of the series, and hardcore fans alike all agreed on one thing, though: this game's story is great.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c098ab82d47c5d552b9a92f61005fb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stardock Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Stardock Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
