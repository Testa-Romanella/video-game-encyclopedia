But first, let me show you what the game is about:</p>\r\nThe trailer:\r\n\r\n\n<p>Memory Lane is a <strong>turn based RPG.</strong> You'll traverse through <strong>five districts</strong> of a glowing metropolis, filled to the brim with <strong>colorful characters.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Interact, chat</strong> and sometimes even <strong>fight </strong>the residents in order to survive the trip down <strong>Memory Lane.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Everything that you see in this game was once an idea, fabricated by the creator. Those ideas are slowly being forgotten and ended up here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0A <strong>name </strong>is everything in this world. It holds everything that you <strong>are</strong>. Lose it, and you'll be <strong>forgotten </strong>by everyone who once knew you. Lose it to <strong>somebody else</strong> and that somebody will gain your <strong>powers and skills</strong>. But there may be another way to get strong enough in order to survive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Your goal is the <strong>city center. </strong>Legend says that an <strong>idea </strong>that can reach it, will be remembered<strong> for all eternity!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Choose the way your name will be <strong>remembered </strong>in this story. And when you reach the <strong>end </strong><strong>of the road</strong>, after you've met all those characters... after you <strong>befriended </strong>or even <strong>slaughtered </strong>them:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Will you remember <strong>their </strong>names?<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>MULTIPLE ENDINGS<br/></strong>Your choices matter!

Since I started creating games with the RPG-Maker 2000 back in 2005, I fell in love with <strong>telling stories</strong> and <strong>creating worlds.</strong></p>\n<p>In 2015\u00a0 I entered an indie game maker contest with a friend of mine. We had one month to create a game from start to finish. It was then when I realized that <strong>my path in life was set.</strong></p>\n<p>I worked on a lot of games, completed a few, learned a lot and also failed every now and then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything you see in this game was created by me. It's tough sometimes but also pretty rewarding when everything comes together in the end. And if you like what I created, I've reached my goal!</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you so much</strong> for looking at my game and <strong>for your support!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T03:30:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ed/4ed7fbd1ea5f3cee4f58c0dc3d181da2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["InfernoGames24"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
