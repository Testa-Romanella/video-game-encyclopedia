We had little to no knowledge of what came before or what would come after.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our one rule was that we could only use the Mouse\u00a0to control our corpse. The seams are there, and blood runs everywhere...\u00a0</p>\n<p>the corpse is meant to be played more than once, but only as many times as it takes to reach the white light at the end.</p>\n<p>RIP Rick Alex, you will not be missed.
