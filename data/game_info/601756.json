Feel free to let me know if you spot anything absolutely horrendous!<br/></p>\n<p>N.B. The model comes from\u00a0NASA JPL's own website\u00a0which is very handy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bd47e01d8c3aec1560cc91968e60c39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4MBInteractive"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
