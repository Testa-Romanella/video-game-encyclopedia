I didn't have time to implement this, but the systems in place up to this point are pretty neat! Good to mess around with for a few minutes at any rate.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Sam, @sammartin159 on twitter, for the original music! Wouldn't be a Team Dog? game without it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80fa6bbe380154e03ca124391796b287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jamasan", "sneakilli"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
