Desire and uncertainty presented by courier boxes<br/>3. hopeless busy life presented by ants ...</p>\n<p>It is natural to make a dark game to express the topics. However, game art as one of the most free art forms, should not limit itself to an \"depressing to depressing, serious to serious\" approach. So that we make a joyful game. Although careful players may find we embed the dilemma, the paradox, and the sarcasm in the core mechanism of the game, in a both concise and precise way.</p>\n<p>The final product is a game you can play without any pressure. Operate the lovely little boxes to fill the rifts which are not scary! However, there exists another interpretation. The player cluster goods together to meet his/her desire(fill the rifts), so that he/she has energy to work harder and buy more goods. As he/she does this, the time elapses and the desire(rifts) expands. The player be comfortable with the cycle finally and fill the rifts to win. But can the rifts actually be filled by goods?</p>\n<p>The game is completed in 48 hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T02:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f53/f53a2b467b372f6ed5780f161d5e3717.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yarray"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
