While it may seem unimpressive today, being built from scratch using Gamemaker by two 14 year olds isn't something to shake a space-stick at! Today, I'd just like to share a piece of my past here, free of charge!</p><p>-What is it?</p><p>Vast is a game about mining resources to sell to traders or shops. It's also about fighting enemies to gain cash! There's gaseous and solid planets... planetary ore... and unlockable weapons!  </p><p>-Controls?</p><p>Left Click: Fire Main Weapon</p><p>Right Click: Fire Sub Weapon</p><p>Mouse Wheel: Switch Sub Weapon</p><p>to use shops, just bump 'em!</p><p>Traders will automatically buy your planetary ore. </p><p>To use upgrade or mercenary shops, use E.</p><p>I know this is a very simple game, but I wanted to share it for free for you all. If even one person enjoys this, it was worth the time!
