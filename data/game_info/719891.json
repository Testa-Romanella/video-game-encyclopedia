The Player is red and the Reacher is green. It's also possible for there to be a peach-colored square, which indicates that it is both the Player and the Reacher.\u00a0Once the Reacher touches the Win button, you're sent to the next level. The catch is that you can't control the Player using WASD and Space. You instead are allowed to change the Player's starting velocity and angular velocity by changing the values on the top right. Also, the Reacher's health decreases if it moves, so you have to make sure that he moves less.\u00a0Once you do so, you can hit the play button located on the top left. You may also pause the simulation, which will restart it and allow you to change the settings on the top right. There are 10 levels. Good luck :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T04:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ac/4ac318ed2f4fb90be33aa466d25e6165.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Arnav K"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
