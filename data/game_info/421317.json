Swords, bows, and shields everywhere... I guess it's up to you to... <em>Clean That Castle</em><em>!</em></p>\n<p>Tidy your way through 10 levels of organisational conundrums by creating matches of 3 or more of each item (sword, bow, shield) so that there are no tiles left in each level. You only have a certain allotment of each tile per level, so take care where you place them!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- left/right arrows to move your cursor<br/>- down arrow to drop the currently selected tile<br/>- z to cycle through your available tile types<br/>- x to reset a level if you get stuck</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><em>Clean That Castle!</em> is made to roughly match the specifications of Panic's Playdate console (https://play.date/) as a fun exercise in making a game for the console even though it's not released yet. As such, the screen size is limited to 400 by 240 pixels and can only use black and white colours!</p>\n<p>The game will start up with a window size of 400x240 but you can also press keys <strong>1/2/3</strong> to scale it up to 2x or 3x scale for easier playing.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>The game's source code is included in the download, alternatively you can visit the project's Github repository at https://github.com/chrislewisdev/domejam<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T03:21:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33a/33ae17fdf621a4459f6a20fb07bc369f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["magspinner"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
