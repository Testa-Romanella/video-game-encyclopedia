Your only means of getting home is to collect the spaceship parts that have fallen into the nearby amusement park. While being chased by agents, you must repair your ship so you can finally return home.\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The game uses WASD to move around and space-button to enter pinball-mode, which allows the alien to bump into the environment around it. Throughout the game the player can collect temporary power ups, and tickets can be collected to buy permanent perks between levels. There are agents that try to catch the player, though they can be stunned by hitting them while in pinball-mode. In each level the player must collect 3 spaceship parts to exit the level and move onto the next level. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T14:24:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d7/4d7a921d7f9bac1055b10b4983e16791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DADIU"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
