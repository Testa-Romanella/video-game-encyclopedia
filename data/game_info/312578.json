I made it with only 15 levels because I am a solo game developer but the gameplay is hard so it should keep you entertain for some time for when you're bored. If you are nostalgic for a casual old school game like they made it in the 90's era I think you wold like this.</p>\n<p>Has controller suport in Windows for gameplay.</p>\n<p>Play it on your phone:</p>\n<p><strong>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HauresMihaiBogdan.OrangeExplorer</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T06:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/83800264d5bac34d46c9d74ced50f0b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HauresB"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
