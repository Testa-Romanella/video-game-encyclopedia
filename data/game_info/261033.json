His quest leads him deep into a creepy catacomb, where he finds a sparkling cup. He rejoices, believing his quest has come to an end. But something seems a bit off...</p>\n<p>If you want to escape the catacomb, you'll need to watch for falling skulls and collapsing floors. Try to collect precious gems along the way - if you're quick, you can build up your multiplier. Pass checkpoints to avoid being crushed by the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Somewhere at the end of the tunnel, there is a light.</p>\n\n<p>Cursader is being developed for iOS, which explains the vertical screen ratio. I'm planning to implement leaderboards and achievements in the mobile release. I hope you enjoy this \"in development\" version!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f15/f15d2798517835548b6edfb2a9fea117.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["backontheteam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
