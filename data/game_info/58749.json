It gets kinda bananas difficulty-wise after a few rounds, try not to be discouraged, and help Sarah on her way.<br/>Perhaps the least clear thing about the game is that if you go into the cockpit and press X, you can drive the ship. Z or Spacebar will shoot from there.<br/>There is unfortunately no win condition, but feel free to brag about how far you got or provide screenshots of any insane asteroids or great food totals you rack up :) <br/><br/>Have fun!\" - author's description", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a23/a23d1651fc209c4953f68d98a541a19d.jpg", "website": "https://static.1bardesign.com/bundles/captainsarah/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
