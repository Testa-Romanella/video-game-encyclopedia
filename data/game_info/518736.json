Teams are determined by colors, Allied are blue, Germans are red.</p>\n\n<p>The second menu option (I'll keep it a surprise until you see it) unfortunately breaks the UI for the points and health system. I've tried multiple ways to fix this. But i'm afraid it would require a complete restructure of the gamemode and gamestate blueprints (in short, a hell of a lot of work). So for now, it kinda works and kinda doesn't. So just have as much fun with that as you want.</p>\n\n<p>There are also two easter eggs to be found in the game, so happy hunting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T03:01:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/819/819afc36ab39559853538989adcb66be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sigma-Erebus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
