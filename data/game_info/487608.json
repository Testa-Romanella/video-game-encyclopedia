I wanted to make a Soul-Knight like game but with as a wizard with combos. So that's what I did! It's an infinite arcade game. I might eventually add bosses, more characters and spells, more items, and more enemies, but only if people want me to.<br/><br/>\u00a0It was made in a few months for fun, and now it is in beta. If there are any bugs or anything that needs to be fixed, comment it and i'll fix it immediately. Otherwise, this is my first game I have ever made, so give me some feedback in the comments. Thanks!\u00a0 ~A</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:40:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b06b3b30c0bb6ef3693c97cbba4026c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adwit Satyawadi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
