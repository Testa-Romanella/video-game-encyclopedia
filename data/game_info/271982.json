This time I made a tamagotchi-ish game in 1 hour!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fun fact, RPG Maker doesn't handle the game by default when minimized and nobody want to actually look at a tamagotchi waiting for something to happen soo I had to hack around that, luckily it wasn't that hard but it was pretty painful. (Feel free to look at the code if you wanna know how!)<br/></p>\n<p>Overall, it's a big mess, things didn't work out like I wanted, the game is not very fun (and there's not that much content) and I may or may not hate everything. But hey, jams.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues :<br/></strong>- Music doesn't loop properly, noticed that a bit too late<br/>- game is not very good<br/>- ending screen text flashes<br/>- the taskbar flashing feature is not really stable</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Made with RPG Maker VX Ace for the\u00a0RPG Maker Games in 1 Hour 2\u00a0\u00a0jam</p>\n<p>Assets from the DawnLike pack by\u00a0DragonDePlatino (yes, the platino is included!)</p>\n<p>Scripts :\u00a0RME\u00a0(RME Team),\u00a0ORMS\u00a0(RME Team),\u00a0Fullscreen++\u00a0(Zeus81), CustomWndProc\u00a0(\u795e\u601d, this is not the original source but I don't know where to find it),\u00a0SetWindowText (jubin-park) and FlashWindow (jubin-park)</p>\n<p>Font\u00a0is from RPG Maker's base resources</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/763a3476f913d3ffdfaa0f342779126f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Princesseuh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
