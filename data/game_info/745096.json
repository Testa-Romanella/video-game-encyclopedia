That's impossible. Running fast? Nah- Jumping high!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Horizontal? Nah- Think vertical - the sky is the limit! ( or not ; ) )</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Never before was there a Hedgefrog, that jumps higher than the heights of clouds\u00a0</strong><strong>with the super original\u00a0catch-phrase \" 'Gotta jump high!\".</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Long story short; it's Johnny the Hedgefrog - and he's the highest thing alive! \"</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Hi we're a collaborating 2 \u4eba\u00a0dev-team, and we're super happy to present you our little title. It would be great if you can check it out and leave\u00a0us some feedback. <br/>The game's origin was basically an inside - joke / parody (obviously inspired by things from the 90es + modern platform games) -\u00a0gone too far and\u00a0turned into this little\u00a0 project.\u00a0<br/> This app only has one level and~\u00a0 is supposed to be <strong>challenging</strong>.<br/>Part frustrating, but also part fun - as you get a hang of the gameplay, the game's features and become more and more familiar with the map-layout.<br/>Eventually, you can try the timer-mode\u00a0 and see how long it takes YOU to reach the top. What's your favourite leap?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to\u00a0play the game on your mobile device, to experience it as intended.<br/>Thank you for trying this beta version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T11:18:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d4/8d46123acb9f04a90bee3865f0a7490b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["nebelstern", "gabrielrod"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
