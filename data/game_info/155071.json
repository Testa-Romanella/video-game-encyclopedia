I was challenging myself to make a (working) top down shooter that is both simple and complicated. It currently has 10 levels, more might be added, depending on the support and my motivation ;).<br/></p>\n<p>In the current version of the game, you fight ghost's and slimes because you are a trigger happy 'Murican cowboy. You can choose between 4 different weapons to slay your enemies. Slay them all to progress to the next level.</p>\n<p>I made the game with Game Maker Studio, contact me if you want the original files to mess around with.</p>\n<p>Hope you guys like it, let me know if you have any bugs/tips/suggestions</p>\n\n<p>And yes, bullets are meant to be shot with their casings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3da41c944a433578fb6e08ebd099bfc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jorito5000"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
