Your goal is to shoot the incoming shapes in order to gain mass. Lose your mass, you lose the game! But be careful, the larger you get, the less time you will have to react. The longer you go the tougher it will be, with varying enemy times and increasing spawn rates. Can you survive the storm?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a32/a328f3998e8052055b1176106769f0bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonrador"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
