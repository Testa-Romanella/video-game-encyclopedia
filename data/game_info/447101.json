Every day you see new cats that need a home in your social media feed. It makes you sad so you try to offer yourself as a foster home. You can't take care of a lot of animals but at least you are doing something! Then you fall in love with one. Maybe one of the oldest, since they stay with you more time because is harder to find them a final home. You adopt them, and then you have one space less than before to foster cats. And you feel guilty since foster homes are hard to find and probably a cat will be sacrificed because your local shelter is out of space. But you really love the cat you adopted.</p>\n<p>And repeat to the infinite.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Art, Desing and Code - Luc \"Naril\" Alvarado Horrillo</p><p>UI Art - HONETi Cute Cartoon Mobile GUI Pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T02:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06b/06b7de2d0584931ad391517a3f221af7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NarilGVB"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
