It lacks a menu and any settings, and the graphics are highly sketchy. My main\r\n  goal was to test the idea of the gameplay.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Title:</strong> PWM Simulator.</li>\n<li><strong>Genre:</strong> 2D puzzle.</li>\n<li><strong>Date of start of work:</strong> Wed Dec 09, 2020.</li>\n<li><strong>Date of release:</strong> Fri Jul 09, 2021.</li>\n<li><strong>Developers:</strong> only me.</li>\n<li><strong>Game engine:</strong> L\u00d6VE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n  The <strong>blue</strong> plot displays a random analog signal. The <strong>light green</strong> plot displays the\r\n  signal derived from the digital signal (see below) by passing it through an\r\n  RC circuit.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n  The digital signal is generated by the user: when the mouse button is pressed, the signal level becomes\r\n  <strong>logical high</strong>, when the mouse button is released, the signal level becomes\r\n  <strong>logical low</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to replicate the shape of the blue plot by the light green plot as close as possible.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Description:</strong>\r\n  \r\n    https://github.com/thewizardplusplus/pwm-simulator/blob/master/docs/gameplay.md\r\n  \r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n  Spoiler\r\n  <p>\r\n    Activate the custom plot by clicking the mouse or tapping on the touch screen.
