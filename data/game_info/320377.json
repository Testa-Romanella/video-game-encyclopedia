A dispute started many centuries ago for reasons long forgotten.<br />\nThe end of the skirmish was nowhere near until the Christians instituted the Templar Order to act as ambassador of the Holy Christian Empire and put an end to this futile war. Not long after, a peace treaty was struck and finally things were looking up. The people of both sides were able to go back to their regular lives.<br />\nBut this peace wasn\u2019t meant to last because soon the Dark Ages began. Days became shorter, nights became longer, crops started to fail, famine spread and diseases where lethal.<br />\nThe conflict started once again between the Christians and the Pagans for food and resources.<br />\nPeople took this as a punishment from their God for the Templars peace treaty with the Pagans, and in order to gain back the favor of God, they arrested and executed the Templars.<br />\nOne Templar knight managed to escape. This last Templar started to look for the only thing that could help, the Holy Grail. He knew that finding it could regain him Gods favor and give people faith in his order once again.<br />\nAfter years of struggles he managed to find the Holy Grail and with it he started healing people, restoring their crops and bringing back the faith in God.<br />\nHe became a hero and the people made him the first Emperor of the Holy Christian Empire.<br />\nBut the Emperor didn\u2019t stop there. Power corrupts the best and attracts the worst and because of this, he reinstated the Templar Order but this time he wanted to make sure it won\u2019t be like the last time. This time with the power of the Grail he made the Templar Order a powerful army that was set on conquering and converting the Pagans to Christianity in order to avoid another Dark Age. Bringing more worshipers to the Christian God will certainly gain His favor, the Emperor thought.<br />\nOne of the Pagan states belonged to the Viking people. This is where our story begins.<br />\nViking Vengeance follows the story of a Viking taken hostage by the Templars as a child to be raised as one of them, who after many years in the Templar army finds an opportunity to revolt against them during a raid in the Viking lands.<br />\nLooking to stop the Templar oppression and push them back you will find yourself on a journey to restoring peace back into your homeland by reconnecting with your true Norse nature.<br />\nYou will go on a quest through different lands and realms where you will encounter a variety of enemies with different characteristics.
