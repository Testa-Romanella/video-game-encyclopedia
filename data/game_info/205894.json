It has deep social commentary, trust us. Move with WASD, jump with space, melee with left mouse, shoot with right mouse. Break an enemy's shield (blue bars) to stun them, then left-click on them to dash to them, with a chance to restore your health. \u00a0Melee restores your gun-drone's power. \u00a0Shields regenerate, but will eventually disappear permanently.\u00a0</p>\n<p> Made for ludum dare 39: Running out of power.
