A heart-shaped stranger. Not only is he riding a whale, he also brings very personal news for Kittey. As he sets out on a quest to find his parents, Kittey has to face what remains of a world nearing its end. From Kitty Island to the City of Cyclopia with its weird enslaved citizens through a huge comet-struck desert into the deepest pits of Darkside, Kittey's big journey may lead to some uncomfortable truths.But, remember: Even if the walls of reality are crumbling and it's becoming hard to tell dreams from reality, Everything Will Be Fine. Just keep collecting those strange Power Hearts that litter the world. It's Always Been That Way. If you get enough of those, you'll surely win! Right?<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart Chain Kitty is a big 3d platform adventure with a few twists. There's a chance you'll like it if you've enjoyed collect-a-thons like Banjo Kazooie or Mario Sunshine but want a bit more added to the formula. This is a continuation of my freeware game series 'A Game with a Kitty'.</strong><br/><br/>The game features inventory items that can be used to interact with the world or its inhabitants. There also are optional quests and hidden levels. The way forward isn't always going to be collecting this game's version of McGuffins. But it'll probably help if you collect them. Nothing wrong with that!<br/><br/>Kittey can jump quite well, but he'll get additional moves quickly. There's the Hat Glide, the Power Glove (good for punching people in the face) and its Screw Ray (tm) upgrade, giving you a way to dominate screws and bolts all over the world. Later on you'll ride bottle rockets and do tricks high up in the sky using the zoom ability.<br/><br/>Don't forget to buy some strength-enhancing cakes from your nerd bro. And maybe some of Darling's life hearts. You'll need 'em!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Some Features Neatly Arranged in a List</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Self-generating Voxel World</li><li>Maps (level/overall)</li><li>25+ Hours of Gameplay (for the best possible ending)</li><li>A chubby Kitty as a protagonist</li><li>Hippos</li><li>Two secret Bosses &amp; optional levels and challenges</li><li>Quests</li><li>A Robot Mom</li><li>Nerds (plural because there's more than one)</li><li>2.5d Levels - hidden 2d levels in a 3d platformer</li><li>Two endings (and one non-ending)</li><li>Gamepad Support and Keyboard Configurations</li></ul>\n<p>Wow!</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>PC: 2GHZ dual core or better, 2000 MB RAM, 4000 MB free disk space, NVIDIA 4xx\u00a0 or Radeon HD 5850 at minimum (=30 FPS at medium res), NVIDIA 7xx or higher for better results (60 FPS at higher res) - any card supporting DX11/OpenGL 3.3 or higher and Shader Model 4 will work.</p>\n<p>Linux: Same as PC, but needs decent opensource drivers or the card manufacturer's proprietary drivers (nouveau open source drivers won't work, for example).
