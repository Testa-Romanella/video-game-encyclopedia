This game is the refreshing experimental platformer that everyone was waiting for. It is not finished yet, but a demo is already available.</p>\r\nThe goal\r\n<p>In Legless Runaway, you will play as a tree that must escape from a bunch of lumberjacks. But there is an issue : trees do not have legs. You will have to find another way to flee...</p>\n<p>As a tree, your only way of consistently moving is to <em>clone </em>yourself <em>away </em>by throwing a seed in the air. You can then influence the movement of the seed so it lands onto convenient grounds.</p>\n<p>Once the seed is planted, you will be able to wait some time before you make it instantly grow into a mature tree. Here's what is at stake : if you do not wait long enough, there might be lumberjacks around the corner waiting to\u00a0chop you down, but <strong>if you overwait, the seed dies</strong>. Moreover, there is a certain amount of time you have to wait as a mature tree before you can throw the next seed.</p>\r\nCommands/Input\r\n<p>The game is played using the arrow keys only, for the sake of simplicity. In the future versions, we migh add the space bar for QTEs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T21:20:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbd2fcce2b1ee95ee91454507c41b38f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Supercherie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
