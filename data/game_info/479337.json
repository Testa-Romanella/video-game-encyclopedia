You'll be collecting hearts and coins along the way.</p>\n<p>Since this is a demo, it is very primitive. I'm planning on expanding on the coin system by offering upgrades in exchange for coins.</p>\n<p>Game-play wise, it is simple. You have a sword which you can use to attack, but also destroy enemy projectiles. Simply swing your sword at the precise moment!\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is also \"pseudo randomly\" generated. The level will change every time you play!</p>\n<p>This version of Ninja Darter is using assets I've found on itch.io and other sites, which I\u00a0will begin to list here:</p>\n<p>itch.io assets:</p>\n<p>https://s4m-ur4i.itch.io/pixelart-clouds-background<br/>https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero<br/>https://timberwolfgames.itch.io/free-chests<br/>https://timberwolfgames.itch.io/weapons<br/>https://obsydianx.itch.io/interface-sfx-pack-1<br/>https://vnitti.itch.io/glacial-mountains-parallax-background<br/>https://savvycow.itch.io/loudypixelsky<br/>https://ansimuz.itch.io/explosion-animations-pack<br/>https://gamesupply.itch.io/33-game-background-music</p>\n\n<p>GameDev Market assets:</p>\n<p>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/coins-chest-sounds/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/cave-platform-tileset-4029/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/pixel-gui-1-0/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/pixel-art-coins-2456/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/pixel-characters-collection-vol-1-6759/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/animated-pixel-elematal-wisp/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/40-progress-bars-incredible-progress-8610/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/classic-footsteps-sfx/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/rpg-skill-sound/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/weapon-master/<br/>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/potion-pack-9170/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4d/f4d6dd03b3a5724d3f4695a96336eb4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cracked_Walnut"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
