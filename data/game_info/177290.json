The player spawns in a procedurally generated dungeon. The goal is to reach and kill the boss Manny the Octalpus. Manny will drop a key which will open the door located in the same room as him in order to move to the next level. On the way, the player will have to avoid or kill any Rabbit Ogres who will drop randomized loot including potions, weapons and armor. The player has a set health and mana. The health will not regenerate, but mana will regenerate very slowly. The player can consume health and mana potions to completely replenish their health and mana bars. As the level increases, the items become powerful, but so do the enemies.</p><p> </p><p><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> https://github.com/evanlaflamme/ARPGSimulator</p><p> </p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p> -Player Movement:</p><p> -Hold left click on the mouse in the direction you wish the player to move in.
