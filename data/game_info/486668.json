To do this, you will gather resources by bundling them up (see what I did there?)\u00a0at the gatherer, and then spending them into upgrading your buildings. Buildings produce different materials, which appear at the gatherer as needed.</p>\n<p>Khersh (to bundle, in ancient egyptian) is a game that combines the casual 3-in-line crusher with a min-maxing kind of city builder. These two genres clash with each other, so vastly different in mechanics for a single videogame. And so, that complies with the jam's limitation: The game must have some kind of conflicting ideas.</p>\n<p>As for other conflicting ideas, there is some orthorgraphic / perspective camera tricks going on to achieve some neat looks.</p><p><strong>Tutorial</strong></p><p>Click on the bottom center building: that's your gatherer! Start bundling up resources, use them to advance your settlement, until Pharaoh's pyramid is complete!</p><p><strong>Installing</strong></p>\n<p>Windows only (for now), Just unzip it and play!<br/></p><p><strong>Changelog</strong></p><p>2020/08/24 - Removed soft block and other bugs.
