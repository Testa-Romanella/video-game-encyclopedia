A game which takes your resource management skills, your tactical prowess, and your imagination to another level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In 2Dimensional Explorers the player is thrust into an open universe complete with stars, planets, moons, gas clouds, and more! Every planet has a story - and every story progresses your own.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Entirely community controlled! Comment your ideas for this base game and I'll add them through-out development.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<strong>Current Update Released<br/>Combat - Star indicator(Replaced Map) - Reworked Sounds</strong>\n<em>(2017-11-30)</em>\n<p>- Added Combat!\u00a0(<em>Very Early!</em>)<br/>You will not be able to use weapons onboard to eliminate randomly spawning enemies (<em>Currently very early! Enemy ships are uniform - variety will be added in next update</em>)</p><p>- Changed Map &gt; Star Indicator<br/>Up until now everytime you spawned a universe, you would have no clue which direction to travel - Not anymore! - Now just simply press \"M\" and your HUD will show all stars and their directions.</p><p>-Reworked SFX<br/>Fixed Crackling sound in ambiance.</p>\n<p><em>(In this update I also redid the button layout in the bottom left corner to make it look better)</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>Completely random universe generation.<br/>Everytime you press play - a new and unforgiving universe will be generated before you.</p>\n<p>- Fully customizable ships<br/>With a large array of modules to choose from - any ship can be improved upon. Add and remove modules at will but watch costs - market prices won't always agree with your vision.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Properly prolonged space battles<br/>Getting into combat isn't the goal here - surviving it is.</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong>Save/Load game<br/>Very basic at the moment - but working functionality so you can generate a new universe but keep your old play-through. (<strong>Updated from yesterday!</strong>)(<em>more features coming soon</em>).</p>\n<p>-Planetary interactions/Harvesting<br/>Added a basic method of harvesting from planets - Your fuel will go down to simulate release speed (subject to change), also gathering metals/exotics/scrap from planets works but is not currently implemented. Will add in next update(<strong>Updated from yesterday!</strong>)(<em>More features coming soon</em>).<br/></p>\n<p>-Stations!<br/>Purchase goods for construction and travel. Stations will be orbiting certain planets. Spawn rate is medium low right now so they are rare. Next up is combat.</p>\n<p>-Combat!<br/>Whether it be for defense or offense - your weapons will always be there for you!\u00a0<strong>(<em>A major WIP</em> -\u00a0<em>Current version not represent final release version's combat system</em><em> - \"I just added this because it was next in line for features, further work will and needs to be put in!\" -Dev</em>)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Upcoming:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Multiplayer<br/>First plan - get all of this wonderful artwork (oh god) working in multiplayer so players can embark together to conquer the universe.</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong>Saving/Loading functionality<br/>Unfortunately due to my lack of experience in the matter - saving and loading\u00a0 will be disabled for testing purposes (only for dev release!)\u00a0(<strong>Updated! See current features!</strong>)</p>\n<p>- Large selection of ships<br/>Whether you prefer to fly as a support fighter - or command a fleet of frigates - the player decides which career to follow.\u00a0<strong>(<em>Currently not working fully but IS present in game - other ships require component/turret pad placement - will be released with upcoming \"Stations\" update.</em>).</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Non-scripted encounters<br/>AI will roam at random - Always be on the ready.<strong>(<em>Currently disabled due to game breaking bugs - coming back in upcoming update)</em></strong></p>\n<p>- Full fleet command<br/>Take control of an infinite amount of ships and become the ultimate force in the universe. Be warned though - your enemies can do the same.</p>\n<p>- Planetary interactions<br/>Each planet currently has its own temperature based on the distance to it's host star. In future builds - distances will be much further touched upon as colonization/industrialization is introduced.\u00a0(<strong>Updated! See current features!</strong>)</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Building/Fortifying<br/>As planetary interactions start to release - further building and fortifying solar systems and planetary bodies will also be introduced. That way your fleet has a home system to go to if they sustain a lot of damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dream features:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>-</strong>Interior combat<br/>Run from the bridge to the hangar bays, fly your fighter into battle then back again to resupply as a boarding party departs.<br/></p>\n<p>-Introducing community ideas and designs/modding<br/>Self explanitory - want to give you guys the ability to make this game what you want it to be.</p>\n<p>--Much More<br/></p>\n<p>Currently the game is in near release development!\u00a0(<strong>Game is released</strong>!)<br/>All features implemented are rough but close to completion.<br/><br/><strong>The way it works:</strong><br/>The Universe will generate a random number of Galaxies - which will in turn generate a random number of Solar Systems - which will in turn generate a random number of planets - which will in turn generate a random number of moons. Other dangers such as Gas Clouds - Space Beasts(in the works) - and enemies(currently only cruisers - fighters/stations/etc. are in the works) are also added in for the kicks and giggles.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Hello - I\u00a0am Nandor - a 26 year old graduated indie developer working from home.\u00a0<br/>I hope you all enjoy the work I've put into this game so far.\u00a0A \"dev release\" was just released to check it out in the discussion board!</p>\n<p>Lastly - thank you to those of you who decide to support me in the end. I'm doing this solo so even words go a very long way.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br/>Bakos133</p>\n\n<p>PS. Since\u00a0I've been asked countless times before if this is going to be the final artwork for my game - my response is god no.\u00a0My digital artwork is terrible compared to most so everything you see now is all just place-holders. I\u00a0am looking to bring my game into the 2.5D scene with a huge update once more of the core aspects of are flushed out.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9f/e9fca3f3cf27b59860a2bab9a91ce6b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bakos133"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
