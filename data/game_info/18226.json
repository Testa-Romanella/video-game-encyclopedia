Come and see a beautiful fantasy world and play like a kid again! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur ambition is to create a simple, intuitive game that kids, kids at heart and new-to-VR-users can enjoy easily. We designed controller interactions to be as simple as possible with no buttons and no menus. Just 2 simple controls take you around your world - grab and move objects with the trigger, complete objects piece by piece by passing the wand through them. Literally - grab your wand and go!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is our Early Access release. We are actively looking for your feedback and want to shape the development of Live In Color together. Let us know what you want to see next!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/51658b95f080359306e01ff647faa32b.jpg", "website": "http://atakotestudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atakote Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atakote Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
