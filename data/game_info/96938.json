It's a top down stealth game set inside a computer, where you play as a heroic anti-virus program. You travel the mainframe deleting corrupted virus parts, and trying to defeat the all-powerful Trojan Horse virus.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT:</strong><br/>\r\n\tThis game was made for Ludum Dare 31, and the theme was Entire Game on One Screen. Our idea for this was that player logs into a computer console and runs a graphical anti-virus program. It didn't quite work for the theme, and the game itself is quite hard, but overall we were pleased with the atmosphere.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP:<br/>\n</strong>Keyboard - Arrow Keys to Move. Spacebar to Attack or Interact<br/>\r\n\tGamepad \u2013 Left Stick to Move. A Button to Attack or Interact\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEach enemy has a red cone in front of them on the screen, which represents what they can see. Avoid this to stay hidden, and sneak up behind them to attack them. Use the purple towers to travel around quickly or get out of trouble. The giant eyeball can see you from anywhere so hide behind walls to avoid it.\r\n</p>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b7a57f72e2cda2f4740d259093c7487.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
