This is my second time completing a game jam and I am really happy that I managed to complete the game on time. The game is based around the theme \"<em>an end is a new beginning</em>\". When the player dies they comeback <strong><em>stronger</em></strong>. I haven't used unity or any other game engine in a year so I was really rusty going into this game jam (~_~;) lol.\u00a0Due to time constraints the enemy AI is very basic I would have liked to implement more mechanics such as dashing, invulnerability, a boss fight, etc but I had limited free time to work on the game\u00a0\u00a0( \ua4a6\u0eb4\ufe4f \ua4a6\u0eb4 ).\u00a0 In the future I would like to come back and\u00a0work on this project more.\u00a0 Overall, I am just happy that I managed to complete the game on time!</p>\r\n\u2570(\u2594\u2200\u2594)\u256f\r\nThanks for playing!\r\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>You can hold left click to shoot bullets</li><li>Enemy bullets are destructible and its encouraged to shoot them before they end up killing you</li><li>When you die gain speed and faster bullets\u00a0but with less hearts than before</li></ul>\r\nTips:\r\n<ul><li>Destroying enemies that spawn bullets faster is key to winning</li><li>Kill ghosts and skeletons first</li><li>Dont stop moving</li></ul>\r\nCredits/Assets Used\r\n<p>https://analogstudios.itch.io/dungeon</p>\n<p>https://analogstudios.itch.io/dungeonsprites</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/orginaljun/sounds/396960/<br/></p>\n<p>https://jdwasabi.itch.io/8-bit-16-bit-sound-effects-pack</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Elringus/SpriteGlow</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T12:03:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/880/880da11aa74fdc15dff3b60e8181bbb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["J_"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
