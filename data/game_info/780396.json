This also seems to be something weird with GameMaker but we will try and see if there are solutions!</p>\n<p><strong>Linux</strong>: This is very easy, just run the game or run it from terminal!</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\n<ul><li>A and D to Move Left and Right\r\n</li><li>Space to Jump\r\n</li><li>R to Shout\r\n</li><li>J, K, L to Switch Between the Three Characters\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n\n<p>Keith Danielson, Colter Snyder, Ethan Jay, Olivia Turner</p>\n<p>Colorado School of Mines, Spring 2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T10:54:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b01/b01c17c4a562f4f119ca805287c5ed4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["coltersnyder"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
