All the visual and interactive elements are designed to follow the music. Together, the ten songs create an emotional journey through modern life, in the form of ten unique VR scenes. Each musical scene is intended to inspire different feelings and insights on different life experiences, with light user participation. They are diverse in topic. Each scene has interactivity in the form of surrealistic or symbolic participation in the journey. For example, in one scene the user witnesses the shattering of a magical prison made of ice. In another scene the user can travel through a maze that symbolizes old age and the end of life. The scenes thus lead the user through a deeply emotional VR experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T05:47:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5cae15cd69a3719887ebb722fe189a.jpg", "website": "http://oaklanemedia.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oak Lane Media"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Oak Lane Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
