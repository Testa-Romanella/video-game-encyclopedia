But it should represent a core gameplay, that will (hopefully) stay in the final version of a game.<br/> </p>\n<p>*Also, game is full of bugs and don't work on any ratio except for 16:9, sorry<br/><br/></p><p>Made in Unity.</p>\n<p>In-Game Music:<br/>\"Blue Sizzle\" by Kevin MacLeod<br/>License: CC BY http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\"Few survivors\" and \"11600 years ago\" by Blear Moon<br/>License: CC BY-NC-ND<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/</p>\n<p><strong>I would be extremely glad to receive\u00a0some feedback!\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:02:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf6/cf606e34cbb31bc4adfe8c855cecd782.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucius Match"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
