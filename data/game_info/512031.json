I have declined payment options for this because of its origin as a school project, and also because I do not own the 2D UI assets that were implemented throughout the game, having accumulated them simply through google images.</p>\n<p>I worked alongside 3 others when making this project, my role was Lead Designer/Producer and\u00a0Software Developer.
