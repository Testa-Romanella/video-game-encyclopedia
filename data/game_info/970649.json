In order to complete a level, you must find a key to open the gate and you will go to the next level. But look out, you can die very quickly if you dont pay enough attention.<br/><br/>You wil always start in a tent or house. As soon as you spawn, find yourself a gun to defend yourself. The zombies are very hungry and interested in you. In order to complete a level, you'll need to kill all the zombies and find a key. Once you found a key, you'll be able to open the gate with that key so you can continue to the next level. Higher levels give you better guns and harder zombies to kill.<h3>What will be added in the future?
