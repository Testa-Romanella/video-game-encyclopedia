{"id": 114633, "slug": "gravity-67408", "name": "Gravity 6.7408", "name_original": "Gravity 6.7408", "description": "<p>\r\n\tGravity is my submission for the 2015/2016 libGDX Game Jam.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTaking place on a cargo ship, you are a cyborg meant to operate and manage the vessel. When disaster hits, the gravitational system goes haywire. You have to navigate puzzles, move crates and manipulate gravity to find you way to safety.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game only has six levels, they are fun but not perfect. I would have loved to invest more time into this game but I was very busy during the jam. I am considering adding to this, for fun, so if you have suggestions feel free to leave a comment!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHope everyone enjoys! And if you get stuck, I will leave this walkthrough video to help you.\r\n<br/></p><p>Github Repo: https://github.com/sugarware/gravity</p><p>Devlog Topic: http://itch.io/jam/libgdxjam/topic/12276/667408-by...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9a/f9abafd973bbfd0d5d12f57e072079b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["sugarware"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
