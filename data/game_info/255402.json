He's a non-believer of all things supernatural, seek anyone who can prove to him that ghost is real. This time, he's trying to uncover the tricks behind the show, but in the end of the challenge, something is coming up. The TV crew are gone without a single trace.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Is this part of the show? Or could you reveal the truth behind this strange event?\r\n  </p>\n<p>You may interpret the plot and decide the final act as you wish. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You'll find 5 different endings, each holds different conclusion from one another, the good ones bring you a revelation and the bad ones will bring up more questions.
