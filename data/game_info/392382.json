A huge unmanned spaceship, launched by mankind years earlier as a last ditch attempt to survive, has found a possible inhabitable planet and is under attack from its residents.<br/><br/>That's where you come in pilot!<br/><br/>From earth you must remotely control one of the giant ship's space blasters and annihilate the alien threat so that humanity can continue. The survival of human kind is in your hands pilot. Don't let us down!<br/><br/><br/>We are a small video game development studio based in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom. After the success of Super Mega Space Blaster Special we decided to make a massively expanded 'Turbo Edition' whilst still continuing the development of our much bigger metroidvania action-RPG The Flawless: Art's Tale. Super Mega Space Blaster Special Turbo expands on the original in every area with more game modes, more space blasters, more challenges, more music, a huge shop, and loads more.<br/><br/>We wanted to make a shoot 'em up (shmup) that blended modern and retro mechanics to create a nostalgic yet up-to-date shooter that gives you the 'just one more go' feeling. Now you can be the judge of this, leave a Steam review and let us know what you think. We are open to feedback and want to improve the game in any way we can. If you have any issues with the game please feel free to let us know and we'll do our best to solve the problem. We hope you enjoy the game, Happy blasting!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-16T14:11:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd489bc30400d0c46457e70c8de2504b.jpg", "website": "https://bareknuckledev.com/games/space-blaster-turbo/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 72, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Bare Knuckle Development"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bare Knuckle Development"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
