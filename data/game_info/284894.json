{"id": 284894, "slug": "3-man-chess", "name": "3 Man Chess", "name_original": "3 Man Chess", "description": "An app version of the \"3 Man Chess: In the Round\" board game! Play a variant of chess which has 3 players on a circular board. The unorthodox shape allows for strategies not possible in normal chess: A rook or bishop can loop around the whole board. Two players can work together to checkmate a third, or one player could potentially checkmate both others at the same time. The possibility of temporary alliances and backstabbing among the players gives a dose of political intrigue to the classic chess formula.<br/><br/>App Features:<br/>- Local multiplayer via Bluetooth or local Wi-Fi. Or just pass one device around between 3 people.<br/>- Save your games to come back to them later. Transfer a game in progress to other devices in multiplayer.<br/>- Turn-by-turn replays of your matches: pause, adjust the speed, or stop in the middle and play the game from there to rewind.<br/>- You can display all the locations a piece can move to for easy learning, or hide them to have a more competitive setting.<br/>- Very few changes from traditional chess rules; just enough to make the 3rd player and round board work.<br/>- All official chess and 3 Man Chess rules are included, and are enforced during gameplay.<br/>- More detailed instructions for using the app and setting up multiplayer are included as well.<br/>- The all-important ability to zoom in, especially useful for phones.<br/>- No ads.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fe/4fee2e7ca9186422fd5754718ff5ee0b_YEzUXcu.jpg", "website": "http://www.3manchess.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Adam King"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Adam King"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
