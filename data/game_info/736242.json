It features characters from Touhou as well as popular Mahou Shoujo franchises, including Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, Cardcaptor Sakura, Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha, Slayers, and Dai Mahou Touge. The basic gameplay is very similar to Touhou Sky Arena: Matsuri Climax, where you use various melee and ranged attacks as well as spells to beat your opponents, but has a much more fluid combat system. Originally released as two separate but combinable Gensokyo and Mahou Shoujo sides, it allowed characters, stages, and music from the two games to be played as a single combined game. The newer integrated version features Story Mode, an original character, and comes precombined and ready to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-09T03:28:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b1/3b1feb96be24cc4c531e77cb37a9a86f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
