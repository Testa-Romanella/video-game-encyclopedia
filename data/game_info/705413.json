With Explodopool, you can abandon this crude technique in exchange for the subtlety and sophistication of generating massive explosions in the middle of the pool table. Doesn't that feel much better? Of course it does.<br/><br/>Sink all the balls as fast as you can! If you're into efficiency, try to clear the table in as few explosions as you can manage! How many balls can you sink in a single explosion? The combo meter will tell you this and nothing else!<br/><br/>Increase the chaos by giving yourself more explosions per second, or increase the challenge by setting explosions to affect the cue ball only, or requiring that the eight ball is sunk last - it's just like a real game of pool now! But with explosions. Always explosions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T11:31:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03a31b195f5924df48c0e98ddbce2acb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["monkeyfluids"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
