The topic was \"Symbiosis\" and we approached the theme with a game based on the collaboration of <strong>two players: </strong>a fish, and the environment where it lives.</p>\n<p>Some <strong>mysterious disease</strong> has corrupted the land in which you, a small fish, lives. All the ecosystem has been affected by it, and the natural balance has been broken: ravenous sharks roam the land, looking for any fish they can eat.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the small fish can purify the corrupted polyps and can help clean the enviroment! The fish player should help clean the sick polyps to keep the corruption at bay, while hiding from the sharks in the clean ones. But as life\u00b4s unstable in these lands, once you enter a healthy polyp it will die. The sentient environment can help the little fish by spawning healthy polyps it can hide in, but at a cost: those polyps can be corrupted too, and the more polyps on the bay, the easier will be for the corruption to raze with all the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Will you be able to maintain the symbiosis in your little home?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls: <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Esc</strong>: Pause the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>As the fish:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>W</strong>: Up</li><li><strong>S</strong>: Down</li><li><strong>A</strong>: Left</li><li><strong>D</strong>: Right</li><li><strong>Hide</strong>: Enter a healthy, green polyp.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>As the environment:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Look around: </strong>Move the camera over the edges of the screen.
