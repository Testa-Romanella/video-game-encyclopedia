The all-new graphics engine brings historic and modern routes to life in eye-watering realism. Operate famous locomotives, explore fascinating routes and unleash your creative side designing and building your own routes and Driver Sessions!<br/><br/>Trainz: A New Era provides train-fans with hundreds of hours gameplay in single and multiplayer as well as countless hours creating your own rail masterpiece using the world-renowned \"Surveyor\" editing tools.<br/><br/>Share and enjoy your creations with our huge community or use the Download Station to access 250.000+ DLC items created by other Trainz fans worldwide.<strong>Key Features</strong>All-new graphics engine with full world shadows and per-pixel lightingMultiplayer <br/>Share your enthusiasm with other rail fans and combine your efforts with others to operate a working rail line!Our most accurate simulation yet with real time world physics and editing tools!<br/><br/>Calculated at 30 times a second, our physics use a variety of configurable inputs such as engine powers, train weight and rolling resistance whilst taking into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each train car when accelerating or decelerating. The brand new real time physics editing tools allow players to tune physics 'on-the-fly' to take their simulation's performance even further.<br/><br/>Brand-new Real-time Physics Editing tools enable users to enter known specifications to accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted \"on-the-fly\". By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).<br/><br/>If physics aren't your thing, don't worry. You can leave the fine-tuning of your favourite locomotive's performance to the experts whilst still having the choice between 'Realistic Mode' or 'Easy Mode' driving options.Procedurally animated spline junctions<br/><br/>An updated set of track laying tools are provided in Surveyor to automatically adds frogs/vee, blades, and checkrails in the correct place on the tracks when making a switch, turnout or junction. The blades then animate as the junction direction is changed.Realistic cab sway and external train motion<br/><br/>Using a new suspension modelling system and additional track and traincar parameters, cab sway and \"car rocking\" from both internal and external perspective provide more realistic train motion visuals. When running on rough track, cars will wobble and shake independently.Smoke and weather affected by world objects<br/><br/>New particle effects and collision systems will prevent rain penetrating a tunnel, smoke will billow out from the underside of a bridge or the top of a tunnel and all particle effects will change velocity, direction and flow more naturally.<strong>Tons of Extra Content</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Access to over 250,000+ free DLC items via The Download Station</li><li>In-game downloadable content system for both payware and freeware options</li><li>Create your own routes with powerful in-game level editing tools</li><li>Configurable control schemes</li><li>Our most expansive soundtrack yet</li><li>Never lose your way with the in-game navigation system</li><li>Open multiple windows to view and compare items in Preview Mode while creating your world in another window</li><li>Incl. 250 page digital user manual - a digital PDF providing detailed information on every aspect of Trainz</li></ul><strong>Brand new Routes and Sessions</strong><br/><br/>Trainz: A New Era provides a variety of high quality routes - both built-in to the core edition or available as Downloadable Content. <br/><br/><strong>Kickstarter County</strong><br/><br/><br/>Based upon the famous Highland Valley route from the early days of Trainz, Kickstarter County has received a huge upgrade with new content, new track, new industries, and new high definition assets.<br/><br/><strong>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio RR, Hinton Division - (United States, 1950)</strong><br/><br/><br/>Hinton Division, one of the major coal producing areas for the C&amp;O, starts just west of Thurmond, WV through to Hinton, WV and includes 4 subdivisions.
