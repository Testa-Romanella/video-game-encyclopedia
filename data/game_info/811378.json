The game demo explores the possibilities of random procedural generation in RTS styled games and the benefits to the RTS genre.</p>\n<p>The core features of mechanized warfare are cantered around a pool of assets that the AI can randomly create it's own enemies from ranging from different chassis, weapons and torso's all with different speeds, health and damage types. To correctly facilitate the mechanics, I personally designed a spawning system that would quickly and efficiently spawn in the enemy mechs adding parts to it until it had created a valid enemy unit.\u00a0 The player unit design however required a more complex system for spawning and adding parts as there were more possibilities that a player might explore...<br/></p>\n<p>The game is built around Mech combat and designing different Mech's to build a formidable team to stand against unpredictable odds. By allowing the player to custom build their own squad of mechanized robots it allows the player to always have a unique experience when playing, due to the fact the opponent (the AI) will also build its own Mechs from a pool of assets, allowing the experience to differ from the first play.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>However, this is only a prototype and still needs more work in my opinion, there are some known bugs that I have had tested at Teesside universities Expotees 2022 however any feedback is always welcome as I am always honing my skills.<br/></p>\n<p>Game features:</p>\n<ul><li>Character creation</li><li>RTS</li><li>Randomly generated enemies</li><li>Mech building</li><li>Mech combat</li><li>Sub-system damage</li></ul>\n<p>I do not take any ownership of the skeletal meshes or animations in my game, they were created by Vlad Tim and his work can be found at:<br/>https://marketplace-website-node-launcher-prod.ol.epicgames.com/ue/marketplace/e...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T10:56:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aab/aabbfdcc86d0b0b6b9cb9e601f07a07d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tyrese Lewis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
