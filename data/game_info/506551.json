The game is stylised based on the aesthetic and limitations of\u00a0the Nintendo Entertainment System, faithful to the original Super Mario Bros.<br/></p>\r\n[why? game]\r\n<p>This prototype was completed on the 14th of June, 2016 as the end product of my high school software development course. Having finished the course, I no longer had any motivation to continue working on this project, hence why it sits in its current abandoned state.<br/></p>\n<p>Everything in the [h3h3 game] Prototype was created by me, Jack5.
