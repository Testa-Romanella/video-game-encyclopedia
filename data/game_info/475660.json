If you have a good strong vine, plenty of water and light, good soil, you\u2019ll get a bunch of sour grapes. But if you make them struggle a bit, you get a few really delicious grapes.</p>\n<p>The simulation begins with a city on the edge of a ley line. You soak up the ley energy and transform it into fear, hunger, and loneliness, then just sit back and watch the side effects.</p>\n<p>The highlight of this game is 5 really awesome tracks I found on freemusicarchive that are free for commercial use (don\u2019t get confused, this is still a free project)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s currently been built for html, windows, and linux. I\u2019ll get a version up for android as soon as my build limit expires.</p>\n<p>And here\u2019s some delicious low fi pics to get your imagination going:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know how much more I\u2019ll do to this - depends largely on user feedback. I wouldn\u2019t mind making some minor changes to the growth rates, or fine tuning the controls, but beyond that I want to keep it as simple as possible. One thing I might be likely to do is put in some more tunes and make it a nice free music showcase.</p>\n<p>#edit</p>\n<p>I added a few new tracks.
