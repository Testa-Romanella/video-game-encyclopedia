{"id": 192194, "slug": "rock-paper-snake", "name": "Rock Paper Snake", "name_original": "Rock Paper Snake", "description": "<p>Only the singleplayer works for now.</p><p>Ludum dare: This fits the theme \"shapeshift\" because snakes shift their shapes as they slither.</p><p>SINGLEPLAYER</p><p>Your aim is to get all the paper (which is snake food - it's the white, crumpled ball) while avoiding the falling boulders (which will fall onto the highlighted red square after your next move. There is no win condition, just see how high you can get your score.</p><p>TWO PLAYER</p><p>Snake: Your aim is to get all the paper (which is snake food - it's the white, crumpled ball) while avoiding the falling boulders (controlled by the other player, but they can't land directly on you). You win by scoring 10 points (number subject to change).</p><p>Boulders: Your aim is to trap the snake into running into itself by strategically placing your boulders around the food and the snake. Your row and column are chosen randomly, but you may choose any open spot within the row or column. You win by killing the snake.</p><p>THREE PLAYER</p><p>Snakes: Your aim is to get more paper than your opponents. Also, each snake can bite one other (red bites green, green bites blue, blue bites red). Biting the tail will shorten the snake (shorter snakes are slower), and biting the head will kill it. A player whose snake is killed plays boulders. A snake wins by reaching 15 points. Eating a piece of your prey gains you a single point as well. A word of warning: When you kill your prey, your predator is no longer being hunted themselves!</p><p>Boulders: A chance to redeem yourself if you are killed. You throw boulders into the arena at your choice of square within a preselected row or column. Both players playing boulders will win if the last snake is killed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShadowFoxNixill"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
