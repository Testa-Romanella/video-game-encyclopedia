It's just me fiddling around with the software but this is a complete game made 100% seriously and with all the found bugs ironed out. Not meant to be a proper project! Don't expect too much from me yet please!</p>\n<p>The game features a 'puzzle combat' where you, the player, have to figure out what moves to do depending on the situation. Low health means you have to heal, an incoming Breaker attack means you have to parry, and all that. The combat is going to be quite a bit more difficult than most RPGMaker projects.</p>\n<p>Horizon's End is about Reed, a hero who has lost his village. He seeks to meet the Time Lord to turn back time so he can save his village, but the Time Lord isn't cooperating. Reed will have to cut a bloody swath through the Temple of Time to gain the power he wants.</p>\n<p>First RPGMaker project. Be gentle!</p><p>Notes: Press enter on the bonfires to save and heal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T02:52:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f00/f0076cd1b57928b771ebaf527bcf4fc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snek Makes Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
