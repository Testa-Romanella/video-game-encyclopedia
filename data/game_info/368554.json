{"id": 368554, "slug": "a-walk-in-a-metro-tunnel", "name": "A Walk In A Metro Tunnel", "name_original": "A Walk In A Metro Tunnel", "description": "<p>Experience the thrill of walking roughly two kilometers of metro tunnel while reading some commentary, and appreciating how the world disintegrates around you.</p>\n<p>This walking simulator was written in C and GLSL using Raylib. The UI elements aside, the game's graphics are all ray marched.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><em>WASD</em> or <em>IJKL</em> to move</li><li><em>Mouse</em> or <em>arrow keys</em> to look around</li><li><em>Q</em> to auto-walk (toggles whether or not you walk forward continuously, like holding <em>W</em> or <em>I</em>)</li><li><em>Shift</em> to toggle between run and walk</li></ul>\r\nWhy?\r\n<p>I feel like I need to explain why this exists. This game went through three decisions based on technical limits, in all parts of the game development process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The idea phase. I wanted to make a game where the games were done via ray marching.</li>\n<li>The planning phase. I like the metro, and metro tunnels are, in a very simplified light, just a tunnel with a railtrack. Which is simple enough of a scene to model with the tools you have when ray marching.</li>\n<li>The coding phase. OpenGL floating-point numbers turned out to not be accurate enough (at least with my naive implementation of ray marching), so everything is very noisy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And that's how you get a game where you walk in a metro tunnel to appreciate how weird technical details can visualize in cool ways.</p>\r\nmacOS support\r\n<p>This game does not support macOS, because Apple has deprecated OpenGL, and has poor driver support. More details in the Git repository.</p>\r\nLicense and source code\r\n<p>This game is distributed under the GNU GPLv3 license, and you can find the source on my Git, or by downloading the metro-source.zip file provided in the downloads below.
