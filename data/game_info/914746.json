In this platformer, you'll try to make the snowman survive and reach the igloo at the bottom of the level by taking at least half of the icicles I've placed in the level. In addition to avoiding obstacles, you can also shoot enemies. This spinoff will be mobile exclusive (only Android for testing, then iOS for stable version).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T15:54:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a1/4a12e592f901befcddf60e6656776a9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["MrWatty"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
