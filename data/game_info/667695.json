Fly a plane, blow some feathers, or become a plumber.<br/><br/>In the Pipe Plumber minigame, you must guide a donut wand around a snaking path of pipes from one silo to the other without touching any of the pipes or the silos themselves. This game encourages the use of your whole room/play space to solve these puzzles. This active use of the 3 Dimensional space around you truly immerses the player into the strange and chaotic world that is Grottonnia. Do you believe you are dexterous and patient, well try this game and find out.<br/><br/>We are constantly working on improving Grottonnia. We're working on new levels, minigames, cosmetic improvements and so much more. One of the goals we want to achieve with Grottonnia is to create a highly optimized game that can be played on almost any virtual reality system. From VR ready laptops to high end desktops, everyone will be able to enjoy Grottonnia.<br/><br/>-<strong>Thank You</strong>-", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T02:35:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64cce520bd2d04c66611a8434fc20c33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["P4L"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["P4L"], "esrb_rating": null}
