It is a <strong>pre-planned game</strong> with <strong>assets made before</strong> the jam start. The jam was used to prototype &amp; test an idea for a game for my BA project.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\ud83d\udc36 Game Description\u00a0\r\n<p>Short &amp; simple game of follow the instructions. Your trainer will give you instructions that you must successfully complete.</p>\n\r\n\ud83d\udc15 Controls\u00a0\r\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4\u00a0 A &amp; D to move left &amp; right</p>\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4 W to stand up</p>\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4 S to go down</p>\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4 F to pick items up<br/></p>\n\r\nKey Features\u00a0\r\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4\u00a0 <strong>Being a dog</strong> - who doesn't love playing as an adorable dog?</p>\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4\u00a0 <strong>Unique controls</strong> - like an elevator, use W &amp; S to cycle through up &amp; down movements. From laying down to jumping, sitting to standing on two legs!</p>\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4\u00a0 <strong>Trainer tasks</strong> - your human trainer will give you tasks through a speech bubble, presenting you with an image. Decypher it's meaning to be successful &amp; add onto your good boy points.</p>\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4\u00a0 <strong>Play fetch</strong> (kind of) - retrieve items for your trainer using F to pick up &amp; drop items. Human does NOT include arms able to throw the ball for you to catch, sorry...</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4\u00a0\u00a0Sunny\u00a0(Art, Code, Design)</p>\n<p>\ud83e\uddb4\u00a0 Poco font by jeti<br/></p>\n\r\nAfter Thoughts\r\n<p>At first I wasn't sure how to connect the theme \"Roll of the dice\" with this already established game idea. I first tried making a completely different game adhering to the theme a bit better, but I struggled to make it. I ended up sticking with my original idea. And with some interpretation, the theme is present within the randomisation of the tasks the player is given.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm quite happy I made it. I again got to learn new things &amp; am quite happy with this small little thing I made. It is not perfect &amp; has a few kinks, but it was fun nonetheless. But I might be the only one who has fun playing the game. I really enjoyed playing it while making it!! lol</p>\n\n<p>I recorded my progress through multiple timelapses - hopefully that will be uploaded soon. But what is soon? We'll see...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a73/a73b6ce318987bc1b37507a71762be02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SunnyShadow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
