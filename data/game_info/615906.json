The Realm of Oblivion is home to lost souls who were forgotten or thought they were forgotten on earth. In order to be reincarnated as they should have, they must find and collect the bones of their former body that can be found anywhere across the land. You play as their guide and help them find their correct path towards rebirth. This game stimulates individual adventures that spark courage and love towards a collaborative goal.</p>\n\r\nRealm of Oblivion Design\r\n<p>When creating <em>Realm of Oblivion</em>, our team intended to create a fun and adventurous roleplaying game for many players to enjoy. We created the\u00a0gameplay using a similar design and rule set as <em>Cosmic Metal + Fuel, </em>which is based on <em>Beak, Feather &amp; Bone</em>\u2019s SRD.</p>\n<p>The themes and aesthetic for our game revolve around a spiritual realm, we hope our large mystical map with much to explore can help place you inside the game for an ultimate roleplay experience.\u00a0Realm of Oblivion is an immersive experience with extended gameplay and tons of roleplaying opportunities. The roleplaying components of our game will be entirely open for the player, creating complete freedom for ultimate creativity. This leaves opportunity for players to connect with the characters they made and explore their emotions.</p>\n<p>Realm of Oblivion gives you and other players a common goal, and as you set out on your own journeys you will find yourself left with\u00a0positive and negative outcomes.\u00a0Players will work together to reach their goal but may also have different motives from other players along the way, for example, in which cards they hold to collect and trade.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Realm of Oblivion is intended to be an immersive game full of storytelling and emotion. It includes mythological and fantasy themes but can also be humorous if the player chooses to go that direction; either way, it\u2019s all up to you!\r\n</p>\n\r\nMaterials:\r\n<ul><li>Realm of Oblivion instruction booklet.</li><li>2-8 Players.</li><li>2 dices.</li><li>A deck of playing cards (for online version)</li><li>Realm of Oblivion required cards (found in booklet)</li><li>a stack of note cards.</li><li>writing and colouring utensils.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Online Version: Miro Template here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T08:11:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/731/731a969055cdcdb87b6c852e3b7a580c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Realm of Oblivion"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
