This game is a mixture of platforming skills and downright trolling.<br />\nThis game supports the use of an Xbox controller as well as the traditional mouse and keyboard.<br />\nSadly, while designing this game I didn&#39;t realize that Macs have a 16:10 aspect ratio so there are currently no builds for Macs. This may change in the future, but for now there are only builds for Windows.<br />\nThis is my first real attempt at making a complete Unity game. I made this game to learn the Unity game engine and to teach myself C#. I learned so much while creating this game and the skills I acquired will help with future projects :)<br />\nFollow Me<br />\nIf you want to see my progress on everything I am working on you can follow me on these platforms.
