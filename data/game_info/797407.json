{"id": 797407, "slug": "bahoo", "name": "Bahoo!", "name_original": "Bahoo!", "description": "Bahoo!<p><strong>Bahoo!</strong> is a prototype submitted for the GameDev.tv Game Jam 2022 (link here). It was made in less than 10 days by Maxime Bolduc, a freelancer under the commercial name of Creations Maxo (CMaxo).<br/></p>\n<p>Welcome\u00a0to the\u00a0<strong>Ukhu\u00a0Pacha</strong>,\u00a0the\u00a0underworld\u00a0where souls\u00a0wonder\u00a0after death. <br/></p>\n<p>You're to team up with <strong>Ba-Ho</strong>, a divine Totem that attract souls through this underworld and bring them back to <strong>Pashamama</strong>, Goddess of Fertility, to be revived in <strong>Kay Pacha</strong>, the land of the livings.<br/></p>\n<p>As Ba-ho is calling for new souls, your task is to rotate the <strong>rings of reincarnation</strong> so that each soul can find its way toward <strong>Ba-ho</strong>. It will sing various vocals which will affect the souls' behavior. Whenever enough souls reach the center, <strong>Ba-ho</strong> absorb the souls into its divine flame and send them upward. Beware as the <strong>rings of reincarnation</strong> are like a complex rotating maze and whenever a soul is hitting a dead end, its desperation is heard by the evil god <strong>Supay </strong>who reclaim the soul back into the depth of the <strong>Ukhu Pacha</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Learn the patterns, rotate the rings<br/>and create a path for the soul to reach Ba-ho!<br/></strong></p><p>Controls and game's rules are as follow:</p>=== AFTER WORD ===<p>Here I am about 5 hours before the dead line to submit this project for the Dev Jam. It been over 24 hours since I last slept and I have barely eaten anything in the last 12 hours. In short, I'm burned out!</p><p>Everything in this game was done by me, with the exception of some of the textures (available for free on textures.com) and the base instrument sounds used together to make the soundtracks (each last like barely 1/5 of a minute) for this project in Music Maker. (I own the commercial licenses to produce work and redistribute said work with those sounds.)<br/></p><p>Was this fun? Yes until the last 48 hours where crap meets fan where I face issues after issues. About 90% of everything I planned to do in this project by the last 3 days had to be scrapped for the sake of just making this <em>\"work\"</em>. It should be normal if you feel like something is missing, because there are plenty of stuff that are about 80% (or 20% if I scrap it to remake it) done. In the last hours, I was working on a score board to display the 10 best scores, but couldn't get the binary compiler to work even though I never had any issues in any previous projects.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Anyway, I hope you have fun playing this game.</strong></p><p>In case some wonder, yes I do plan on working on a real commercial release of this game in a future... really far away into the future (considering the current state of the game).</p><p>This project includes the source files (in Unity) as it's part of the requirement for the Dev Jam. Feel free to download it, modify it and learn from it, if there's anything to learn about it. (Maybe \"What should you NOT do in Unity?\" and \"Learn the paradox of how to make things overly complicated because you're too busy elsewhere.\")<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T20:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8ead421d1105cf1d5518483ac7cf5205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CMaxo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
