Talk to the locals, and gather the maize crops for the incoming Spaniards. As you and the rest of your city welcomes this new people, you can't help but feel a bit unease.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This was our final project for History by Design at Fitchburg State University <em>The Fall of Mexica\u00a0</em>is intended to be a small, but self-contained chapter of a much-larger game, far beyond what could be done in a single semester. It would cover the full extent of the Spanish invasion and conquering of the Aztec Empire, including the fall of Tenochtitlan.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Extensive research was done for this project, to ensure players would receive the most historically-accurate experience of the Nahual/Aztec culture as possible. The inclusion of statues based on Nahual/Aztec gods/godesses, the ullamatizi court, and the Templo Mayor, were prioritzied as the most critical elements of this game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT TEAM:\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Zach Shirikjian - Programmer/UI Designer</li><li>Sam Hilty - Game Designer/Lead Artist</li><li>Thomas Nichols - Narrative Designer/Assistant Artist\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T07:06:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9a7421b74ca33ea14d084894c45715b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZAMANIAC Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
