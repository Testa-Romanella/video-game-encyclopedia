It stars a playable version of the frat boy protagonist of the original F.U.L.E. game, Jason.<br/>\nThe game features only two parts. The first is an introduction of the new Jason and the second is the story of his relationship with his girlfriend, Aria.\n\nPlayers will be able to play the game with a single controller or a Wii Remote (if applicable).\n\nThe game is available for download now.\n\nIt's been a long wait for Jason to finally get his own new video game. And it's about that time every year when he finally gets his own video game.\n\nBut, if you can bear with it, this time you can too.\n\nThe first game in the series, F.U.L.E. was released in 2003 for Nintendo GameCube.\n\nAfter that came F.U.L.E. 2 and F.U.L.E. 3 and F.U.L.E. 4 and F.U.L.E. 5, F.U.L.E. 6, and F.U.L.E. 7, and just recently, F.U.L.E. 8.\n\nAmong that time frame, F.U.L.E. 8 is even younger than everything else.\n\nAt the start of the game, Jason is a blank slate; a fresh face that has never seemed to fulfill his potential</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:32:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a31/a3197ea5efe0af28dc3bc5b5218c0cfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
