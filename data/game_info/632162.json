What was a 3 minute walk from the apartment door to the car like for a person with health anxiety during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic? How does the transition from one safe space to another feel when that transition takes place through a highly\u00a0unsafe one?</p>\n<p>This project was my attempt to put into a game the feelings that I and likely many others experienced in this time. It is a work of compassion, and empathy, and hopefully will allow others to feel seen or to understand what some of us went through.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T03:56:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8beb771b0f8eeba663dbfa0d1462830.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["serif_"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
