The objective is to collect all the bits of phone and then escape in the rocket. Bits of phone are hidden in pits on the map, which you need to explore. Explored pits are cleared. Trying to stop you are 3 agents which follow you around the map. They can move more quickly over diagonals and will get more desperate as you collect more pieces of the phone, getting faster. Once you have 5 bits of phone the rocket will appear, and you must race to get there before the agents catch you.</p>\n<p>The game is hard, but completable (see the included GIF). The trick is to choose carefully the\u00a0 order of the pits you clear and use the agents behaviour on diagonals to herd them out of the way.</p>\n<p>Included is a SAM Coupe DSK image (EDSK format).
