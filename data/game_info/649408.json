See how much gold you can hold at once.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T04:39:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71a/71ae804695bea68e1c451b0f69d5f5f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Berez"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
