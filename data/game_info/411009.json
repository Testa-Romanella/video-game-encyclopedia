The PC player will be able to see a top-down view of the area. The VR player would be centrally located on the map and will have a 3D view.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of the trash will be mixed up and come from one single entrance.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Both players must work together to direct trash towards their proper exits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each object type will have its own exit.<br/>The game plays in two phases: the planning phase where the PC player places conveyor belts strategically and then the playing phase where the VR player processes and sorts the trash.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The PC player can still change the conveyor belts positions and directions.<br/>You lose life if the trash falls or is sorted in the wrong way. The game ends when you don\u2019t have any lifes left.</p>\n\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>FREERIDE studio</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Programmer, game mechanic and implementations\u00a0</p><p>[\u00a0https://twitter.com/_JanSchneider ]</p><p>[\u00a0www.janschneider.ch ]</p>\n<p>[\u00a0https://jacasch.itch.io/ ]</p>\n\n<p>3D and 2D\u00a0artist &amp; UI \u00a0</p>\n<p>[\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/miir_rah/?hl=en ]</p>\n\n<p>3D artist &amp; programmer\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>[\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/keuzli/?hl=en ]</p>\n\n<p>level design, game mechanic &amp; visual design\u00a0</p>\n<p>[\u00a0https://thepototo.itch.io/\u00a0 ]</p>\n\n<p>3D artist, enviroment design &amp; sound implementation\u00a0</p>\n<p>[\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/jnr_akira/?hl=en ]</p>\n\n<p>3D artist &amp; VR test\u00a0</p>\n<p>[\u00a0https://hdme.itch.io/ ]</p>\n<p><strong>MUSICIANS</strong></p>\n\n<p>musician</p><p>jonas.fullemann@zhdk.ch</p>\n\n<p>musician</p>\n<p>marcello.studer@zhdk.ch</p>\n<p>Context:</p>\n<p>Z\u00fcrcher Horschule der K\u00fcnste [\u00a0https://www.zhdk.ch/ ]</p>\n<p>Sem.5 - Kollaborative Welten \u2013 Multiplayer - Ren\u00e9 Bauer &amp; Max Moswitzer\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T02:29:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c53/c5341726f1f4a138adc54a0e5cca0047.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HD_ME"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
