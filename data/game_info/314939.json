You must locate and bring back wrecks from among the asteroids and derelict stations to sustain Humanity and also to fuel your ship. You can also choose to drain the fuel tanks of the wrecks on location if you don\u2019t have enough to make it back. Just use the component scanner to locate the fuel tanks and suck them dry by attaching your harpoon. Choose carefully how to spend your fuel, disabling Auto Stabilization will save fuel but will make it much more difficult to fly. Crashing into asteroids or wrecks will cause fatal damage and breaking wrecks into pieces will make them less valuable.</p>\n<p>Bring back 3 wrecks to the station to win or run out of fuel and perish among the asteroids!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>RMB Orient Ship</li><li>1/2 Arm Harpoon (Left/Right)</li><li>LMB Fire/Release Harpoon</li><li>Q/E Roll Ship</li><li>Z Enable Auto Stabilize (SAS)</li><li>F Pulse Scan</li><li>R Component Scanner</li><li>C Cut Wreck while close</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Bram: code<br/>Mart: code<br/>Siim: art<br/>Dan: art<br/>Morr: emotional and spiritual support</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T08:15:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/3180d64d85e7f6ff72fbbce41808e9d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["danmakesgame"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
