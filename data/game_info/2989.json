Games on the Down Low can take no responsibility for your loss of job or social life due to playing it.<br/><br/>Ok, now that we have that out of the way (government mandated by the way!) you are probably asking what is this Hard8 game I have been hearing of all about?<br/><br/>Well the premise is simple, you tap one of the 8 columns to drop dice onto the board, trying to clear them by making 8&amp;#39;s.  You can use any number of Dice in any combination to make an 8.  So a 6 and a 2 will clear the same as a 1, 1, 1, 2 and 3.<br/><br/>Sounds simple?  Well we are throwing a few tricks your way.  First, there are rounds that move items from the bottom up towards the top.  Second, there sometimes are dice that are random numbered until you drop them.  We are sneaky like that!<br/><br/>We do give you some tricks to help you out.  If you drop your dice on 3 cherries a Cherry Bomb is unlocked.  The Cherry Bomb will clear the entire column it is dropped on and the bottom row.  There are also 3 fruits that can be captured.  To get a fruit you have to make more than a single 8 on one dice drop.  Getting all 3 fruits will clear all the blockers on the screen.<br/><br/>You want more features?
