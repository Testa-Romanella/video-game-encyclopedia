Players can drag and drop flowers to different positions on the board. If a flower is dropped next to another flower and there's an empty space nearby, a child flower is created by mixing the genome of the parent flowers. There's no objective - just fill up the board with pretty flowers and share what you've created!</p>\n<p>This game was originally created for GitHub Game Off 2017. I only had a few free days to work on the jam and the \"Throwback\" theme drove me to the antique illustration look that sort of developed here. I do think there are parts for a more robust puzzle game here - I might explore that in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f62/f62a087622b51be9dba4f339c93979f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["islemaster"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
