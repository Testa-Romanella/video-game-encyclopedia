{"id": 937901, "slug": "rache-der-reti", "name": "Rache der ReTI", "name_original": "Rache der ReTI", "description": "<p>What once began as harmless lecture content has become a threat to all of humanity:\u00a0The ReTI\u00a0I (Rechner Technische Informatik) has evolved into a super-powerful super-computer at the University of Fribourg and is now trying to infect the whole world with an insidious virus. But three unequal heroes\u00a0face the certain end of the world.</p>\n\n<p>With the help of these heroes, you must manage to destroy the ReTI.\u00a0But be warned! The ReTI sends out robotic zombie computers to kill anyone who gets too close.</p>\n\n<p>Are you ready to face this danger? You must use your heroes' abilities strategically\u00a0dodge the zombie machines and collect the code snippets scattered around the university,\u00a0to destroy the ReTI. You are the last chance to save humanity from extinction. It\u00a0depends on you!</p>\n\r\nGameplay\u00a0\r\n<p>The player has the task of eliminating the antagonist, called ReTI. For this, the player has three controllable heroes with different abilities at his disposal. All the code snippets scattered around the game world must be collected in real time. But the ReTI is vigilant. It sends out its zombie computers to kill the heroes. The heroes must act as undetected as possible, because they cannot kill the zombie computers, but only deactivate them for a short time. In addition, the heroes are under time pressure, because the longer the game runs, the more zombie computers are available to the ReTI. If the player has collected all the code snippets, he can switch off the ReTI and thus win the game. If, on the other hand, two mortal heroes are dead, the player has lost.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n\n<p>https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/</p>\n<p>https://99sounds.org/free-sound-effects/</p>\n<p>https://kenney.nl</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/de/</p>\n<p>https://www.voicy.network/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\nActionKeyMove CharacterRight-click on the position you want to walk toSwitch Hero/Select HeroesTab-Key or draw Rectangle by\u00a0left-clicking and draggingOpen DoorLeft-click on the door you want to open with the HackerUse EMP\u00a0Space -Key with the WarriorPick up code snippets\r\nLeft-click on it with the Warrior or the HackerDeactivate CPULeft-click on itToggle SwitchLeft click on it<br/>Toggle Full-screen\u00a0F5-KeyToggle Tutorial-ModeF1-KeyBack/PauseEsc-KeyToggle Debug-ModeF12-Key", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T20:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c3/3c3dcf5f9cff0b5388cbfafdae837036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["MeiTh0717"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
