{"id": 250383, "slug": "dead-cel", "name": "Dead Cel", "name_original": "Dead Cel", "description": "DeathRun is a rogue-lite, metroidvania inspired, action-platformer. You'll explore a sprawling, ever-changing castle... assuming you\u2019re able to fight your way past its keepers in 3D souls-lite combat. No checkpoints. Kill, die, learn, repeat.<br/>No run will be the same. The game is a constant sequence of trial that's accompanied by addictive fast pace gameplay, beautiful 3D graphics and a diverse pool of different playstyles. Somewhat challenging at first but when you do a couple of runs and get the gist of the game, it'll become much easier.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/576/576b2b3a5f1a045d90abad332187ff34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["amine Eddaha"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["amine Eddaha"], "esrb_rating": null}
