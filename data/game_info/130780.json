It's not much, but it's at least finished which is better than I normally do.</p><p>Space to start the game, escape on first screen to exit the program if you've downloaded it (or a cheeky Alt-F4 will do it anytime).</p><p>[Attributions]</p><p>All Balloon sprites taken from http://opengameart.org/content/balloons-set-01 from Author GameArtForge<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b6/1b6172321da4c55a3cf55513b20aafa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Beefsports"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
