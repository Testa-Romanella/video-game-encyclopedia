You can hold as much as you want, if you go over your limit you'll burn twice as much fuel! (not good!) If you're low on fuel already, it's probably a good idea to decrease your F.A.R.T. rate (Fetching All Rare Treasure) A red light marked \"OVERLOAD\" will blink when it's too late for you to worry about that anymore.</p>\n<p>-Each space station you visit has a shop where you can trick your ship out with sick new upgrades</p>\n<p>-Don't forget to repair your hull and \"Top 'Er Off\" to make sure you can get to the next station</p>\n<p>-Rumor has it some treasure chests will bite you a few times. It imagine it only hurts a little bit but it's probably kinda gross.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T05:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ca/8cafd9ecc67af2abebe6f1a50e3af93d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Little Doctor Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
