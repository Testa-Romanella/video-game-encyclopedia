Dev note, it is probably impossible to beat the game on\u00a0the first run, if you do let me know, then I have to make it harder.\u00a0\u00a0I was way too ambitious, had a bunch more ideas. Even made my own music, much harder than I thought it was. \u00a0Thanks for the support of my two siblings for lending me their voices. Thanks Maddox and Molly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:37:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/356/3562a568b11f6b59d642f10edb856f73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Face Core Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
