This is the first Ludum Dare game jam (or any game jam) that I've participated in. I've also never dealt much with music. While I didn't end up creating any original tracks for this game, I\u00a0did have to learn a lot about audio in Unity as well as how songs are measured in time.</p>\n<p>I'm really happy I decided to jump into the game jam, I\u00a0had a ton of fun with the process and I'm very pleased with the result. It will likely be a project that I\u00a0continue working on.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0tried uploading a MacOS build but had issues with being able to play it after downloading from itch.io.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afaabe3596691c29b584b89c4ddd8597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mhorth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
