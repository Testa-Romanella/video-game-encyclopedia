Cars, trucks, helicopters, aircrafts and many more.</p>\n<p>In this first version of the game it is possible to quickly select Airplanes, helicopters rather than cars or industrial and rescue vehicles. Each vehicle has its full functionality for which it was designed in reality (cargo helicopter transports vehicles or objects, fire fighters extinguish fires and so on). Given the presence of planes and helicopters, the scenario based on procedural technology is infinite, so there are no space limits.</p>\n<p>Next Drive is suitable for all age categories, if you liked the game you can find a list with all my free games at this link.</p>\n<p>Also follow me on:</p>\n<p>Portfolio</p>\n<p>YouTube</p>\n<p>Unity</p>\n<p>Ciorbyn Studio Blog ( Italian )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:12:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b31/b31d5986364f26f375e89afc31dda126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ciorbyn Studio"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
