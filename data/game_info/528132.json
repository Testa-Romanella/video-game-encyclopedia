Not much thought in game design, so the levels and models are pretty raw and basic.</p>\n<p>The stages for the prototype were made exploring the rail shooter game play.\u00a0<br/>Only in the last boss stage you will be able to play in a free mode (3D freedom), in a small chamber you have to destroy the reactors of the mothership.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p># Weapons<br/>You have a double laser as a default shot, a charged shot and a guided missile.</p>\n<p># Controls<br/>Its a control pad based game at moment to give a better gameplay.<br/>Keyboard is ok, but don't expect much. No mouse, its only for menu access.</p>\n<p># Prototype\u00a0<br/>It is a little PoC (proof of concept) of my framework project, trying to create a easy way to improve game development in my future projects, it consists of:<br/>1.Main Title<br/>2.Options/Configuration<br/>3.Aircraft selection (3 with no difference in gameplay)<br/>4.Small how to play<br/>5.Stage #1<br/>5.Boss - ROB<br/>6.Stage #2<br/>7.Boss - Mothership<br/>8.Ending<br/>9.Short cutscenes between the stages.</p>\n<p># Bugs<br/>Must be one here and there, but it is playable with no problems.<br/>Also if you have a control pad and don't work, let me know. Comments and reviews are very welcome.</p>\n<p>#Version<br/>Red demo no bgm version .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T05:38:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ae/6aeac1c9fbfbecb1669a9e9e9ddf7084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daugsc"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
