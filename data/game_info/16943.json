{"id": 16943, "slug": "megabyte-punch", "name": "Megabyte Punch", "name_original": "Megabyte Punch", "description": "<p>In Megabyte Punch, the player controls a robot who fights fellow robots for spare parts. It combines elements from various genres, such as beat&#39;em up and platformers.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The main protagonist is an unnamed robotic creature that lives in a colorful world of robots. The character tries to defend its village from enemies from such factions as Valk Empire and Khoteps. Its goal is to beat multiple robots to reach the enemy leaders and defeat them.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is a side-scroller, in which the player leads his or her robot through levels and fights enemies. The protagonist has two types of attacks, one is basic, and the other is special. There are six zones, or &quot;worlds&quot; in Megabyte Punch, each divided into three levels. Curiously, the local robots realize that they live in the game&#39;s levels and refer to them as such. Each world ends with a boss fight. </p>\n<p>The protagonist&#39;s home village serves as a hub. It allows the player to explore the worlds in any order, as well as to buy and use upgrades. The village is also where the character respawns after dying. </p>\n<h3>Upgrades</h3>\n<p>Defeating powerful enemies grants the protagonist spare parts to upgrade itself. The player is free to customize his or her robot. Some additions improve the character&#39;s existing skills, while others give it new options, such as different types of attack. For example, the player can equip his or her robot with additional weapons, such as a gun or a hammer, or enhance its jumps with a rocket booster. The player can save and load the upgrade schemes.</p>", "metacritic": 69, "released": "2013-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf2947af6c3ef3793b5c3d5c686ca785.jpg", "website": "http://megabytepunch.team-reptile.com/", "rating": 2.31, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 1040, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 18}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 42, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 42, "platforms": ["Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Team Reptile", "Reptile Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Reptile", "Reptile Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
