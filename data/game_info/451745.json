The last person on Earth finds hope that there could be another survivor and travels to find them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A robot following the path of the survivor\u00a0has visions of what the human experienced in his last moments. These visions lead the robot to learn more about the human and himself, slowly remembering parts of his past and who, or what, he once was.</p><strong>Note:</strong><p>This game is in a super early state and has many bugs with very little play testing. It has no current way to properly end so ALT+F4 will have to do for now. It was developed for StaffsJam 2020 with the theme of Human.
