Your creator, the fabulously evil Dr. Lightning, is about to show you to the world! You are her magnum opus, the one who will save her career and bring her the recognition she deserves! However, before she shows you to the masses, she\u2019ll need to run a few\u2026 \u201cexperiments.\u201d Dash into Dr.Lightning\u2019s army of failed projects, earn points and prove that you deserve to be her next. BIG. HIT! Play either by yourself or with a friend, and score points and get combos to Dash and Bash your way to glory!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Players are dropped into an arena with nothing but the ability to move and dash forwards, as constant waves of enemy robots stream in towards them, each with different unique properties. players must dash into these enemies, knocking them backwards into environmental hazards in order to destroy them. All the while, these hazards are raining from the ceiling, keeping the playspace fresh and fun. The only way for players to destroy enemies (and thereby score points) is by knocking them into these hazards, running into an enemy without dashing will cause the player to take damage. As the waves and rounds keep coming, players can rack up combos and point modifiers as the difficulty only ramps upwards. Once they\u2019ve either destroyed all the waves, or succumbed to the continuous onslaught, their score is recorded and kept track of on a local leaderboard, pushing them to try again to score higher. Also included is a full tutorial, where the mechanics are introduced to the player slowly and by Dr. lightning herself! Dash and Bash your way through the pressure to see if you have what it takes to rank among the best.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Team Roles:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Engineers:</p>\n<p>\u25cf Garrett - Backend Systems/Animation implementations</p>\n<p>\u25cf Jackson - Frontend Systems/Sound Systems/Dialogue System</p>\n<p>\u25cf Samuel- UI</p>\n<p>Artists:</p>\n<p>\u25cf Manny - Lead Character Design and Animation</p>\n<p>\u25cf Patrick - UI and HUD Design, Script Writer</p>\n<p>\u25cf Alex - Enemy Design and Animation</p>\n<p>\u25cf Justin - Environmental Art and Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T09:36:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/662/662d3c671cddf150bf216dae811ab9fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jbug703"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
