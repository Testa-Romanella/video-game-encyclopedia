The Mobile Arsenal Platform (M.A.P.) was humanity's greatest feat, and its ultimate undoing. These pilotable machines were so feared that it forced the hand of many nations to use nuclear weapons. At least such machines truly led to making war obsolete... However...</em></p>\n<p><em>Due to the absence of humans, let alone pilots, the advanced AI outfitted with all of humanity's collective knowledge in these machines started mimicking what their pilots would talk about in an effort to be productive. While many M.A.P.s were used in the war, some were outfitted for civilian purposes as well. The machine and pilot formed a symbiotic bond: one mind relying on experience, luck, and understanding; the other relying on fact, math, and analysis. Without pilots, these machines are, quite literally, empty inside.</em></p>\n<p>The goal's simple.
