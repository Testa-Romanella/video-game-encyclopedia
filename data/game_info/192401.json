The 4\u00aa 99jam occurred in December/2017. You can see other games developed\u00a0here:\u00a0http://99lab.itch.io/</p>\n<p>The jam's theme was \"transformative education\". Our first idea was to make a game about shooting books at persons, but we decided to not to make (sadly). But we had another idea, more close to the theme, where you don't transform people, but transform yourself into a positive person by fighting pessimism... on the Moon.</p>\n<p>That's DarkMoon. You're on the Moon, you have to combat dark magic skeletons by shooting into their pessimism and converting into\u00a0optimism. You only have a little time to do that.</p>\n<p>Languages supported: English, Portuguese</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Aerton Castro\u00a0</p>\n<p>Angelica Piovesan\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fabio Azevedo\u00a0</p>\n<p>Polliana Silva</p>\n<p>\"A Walk into Space\" -\u00a0 Topher Mohr and Alex Elena<br/>\"Assasins\" - Audionautix<br/>\"Heartbreaking\" - Kevin MacLeod<br/>\"Hero Theme\" - MK2<br/>\"Meditation Impromptu 01\" - Kevin MacLeod<br/>\"Night Runner\" - Audionautix<br/>\"Prelude No. 15\" - Chris Zabriskie</p>\n<p>\"Fantasy Monster(Wizard) DEMO\" - TS WORK</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74f7956a2d270e918d9b551c206b288a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aerton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
