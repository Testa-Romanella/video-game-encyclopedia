{"id": 424307, "slug": "go-club-simulator", "name": "Go Club Simulator", "name_original": "Go Club Simulator", "description": "<p>This project was create to help Go clubs that are unable to meet in person due to the coronavirus. It is my hopes that these clubs will find this project useful.</p>\n<p>This was build using Unity C# and Photon Networking. I used my Go server prototype and reworked it to be compatible with multiple people in rooms to be more like table top simulator than a one vs one game.</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: This is very alpha stages. It was a rushed project to get it out to people to use during the pandemic. It is not by any means a fully fleshed out project. There are bugs and it does lack some features. I was able to get the core mechanics to work like I wanted but there is a lot that would take me months of work to fix and add.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If there are any bugs please message me on discord or post a comment on the discussion board. To report a bug please include screen shots and how to recreate the bug. The more information you can give the better.</p>\n\n<p>This project is completely free to use however donations are greatly appreciated. In order to have more than 20 people online at the same time I will have to pay regular fees and donations help with that. If I can raise $100 this will pay for up to 100 users to be online at the same time for 60 months.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T03:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d15/d15127202b8836f2488e1008632a3db0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clossius"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
