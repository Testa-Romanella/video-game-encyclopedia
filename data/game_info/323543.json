In his presentation Paschalis described the causes and effects of obesity while also pointing out the many advantages of good nutrition. Moreover, he presented that research has shown that in immersive first-person 3D computer games the visual characteristics and behavior of a player\u2019s avatar influenced the players\u2019 actual behavior in real life. Based on these facts he then asked the students to come up with a game idea and gave them insides on how to do so.</p>\n<p>One of Tao\u2019s students came up with a game idea where the main character, while having to go through a maze avoiding various obstacles, has to choose between healthy, unhealthy/fast food, fruits and sweets. When the character chooses the healthy options the player\u2019s score increases and visa versa.</p>\n<p>The script for the game was then developed into an actual 3D computer game using Adobe Photoshop, Maya 3D and Unity by a group of students from Paschalis\u2019 Multimedia Project Management class, under his supervision.</p>\n<p>The game, due to the limited time for development, can be further improved but it is currently playable and can serve as a prototype for a more advanced game with more options and characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T04:59:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b6/4b6e530f29c80897ff281fed0eb0f921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MILT"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
