It has a few levels to showcase the game's simplicity and easy to grasp controls. It features five levels, a single song soundtrack, and an awesomely customized main menu by yours truly (everything was made by me but I like the main menu a lot) The game will feature way more levels and a whole lot more features! Some features would be pressure pads,\u00a0 Fans, doors that need to be open by grabbing a key and the list goes on! I still have alot more to make and add like saving and loading, the esc menu sets up for this but doesn't have any functionality so far.</p>\n<p>Donations are optional but I would love the support!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T05:06:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42a/42ac0b9c852e103b710be3b91a331749.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ExQuillibar"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
