Whenever you hear anything, be careful. It definitely heard you.</p>\n<p>Food and beverages can be found here and there on all levels, and are required for survival.</p>\n<p>Increasing the difficulty of the game will increase the speed of creatures, the chance of creatures spawning,\u00a0and decrease maximum thirst and hunger.</p>\n<p>Make sure you keep moving on the later levels, as Seekers will devour still targets.</p>\n<p>LEVEL 0: Generally people who land in the backrooms will land here. Full of yellow wallpaper and damp carpet. Not too dangerous, but be careful. You might enter Level 1.</p>\n<p>LEVEL 1: More dangerous\u00a0 than Level 0, and you have a small chance of landing here. Consists of concrete walls and tile floors. When in the dark, the creatures will be much more difficult to see. When it is dark, you must rely on audio cues to dodge enemies.</p>\n<p>LEVEL 2: Consists of dark, long hallways. The darkness of Level 2 makes it very dangerous. Either run, or hide. You may be able to find a torch here, as some explorers have died there. Torches only last a few rooms before burning out. You also may find repellant here. Repellent can be used once, and only one canister can be held at a time. It will defend you from 1 monster attack. This is one of the easier levels to escape.</p>\n<p>LEVEL 3: Widely considered to be the most dangerous of the 4 main levels, You will likely die here. You may be able to find torches and repellant here.\u00a0 This level consists of narrow, dark tiny concrete hallways with pipes of mysterious black sludge. The sludge leaking out of pipes tastes less than desirable, but it will keep you hydrated while you're there, as nothing else to drink will be found on Level 3.\u00a0</p>\n<p>LEVEL 4: If you can survive Level 3, you will turn up here. Looks and feels like an office building, but is way larger. Not many creatures live here, and it is the safest of the early backrooms. Level 0 is slightly more dangerous than this. Many lost explorers have settled here, and you are likely to find some. This is your end goal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CREATURE LIST</p><p>Phantoms - Will chase you at a slow pace. Very easy to avoid. Spawns in level 0. Has the appearance of a red and light-grey circle.</p>\n<p>Gigglers - Will teleport far away from you and charge slowly in your direction. Relatively easy to avoid. Spawns in levels 0 and 1. Has the appearance of a red and grey cog.</p>\n<p>Followers - Will charge twice at average speed in your direction. Relatively average to avoid. Spawns in levels 1 and 2.
