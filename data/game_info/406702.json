So you wanted to see the ending of the game or you can\u2019t go to the next level?</p>\n<p>Here are all the answers!</p>\n<ol><li>You will spawn in the top of a house and you can\u2019t move. If you pay attention, the debug logs told you that the pause is available but colliders are corrupted. Pause the game and the house will be invisible. Now you can move through it while the game is paused.</li><li>A few NPC\u2019s insist in a movement combinations and in the number 4. When you do the combo (left, right, attack) and your character will be bugged! It will move at full speed and will destroy things that are \u201cinvisible to the eyes\u201d. A character in the lower left corner of the screen said that the essential to the eyes is real and other woman told you to go by the trees. Go to the left\u00a0 and there\u2019s a bunch of trees. You will see that they are invisible at pause. \u201cInvisible to the eyes\u201d. Now execute the combo to bug the player and go over them! The trees will be destroyed. Now move between the trees and you will go to the next level.</li><li>You are in a new house and characters are talking about the Phoenix Tears that will guide you to Lia. The item manager is broken so chests are spawning all over the map. Collect them until you find the item. Now you can use it from the main menu. Select it and you will go to level 3.</li><li>In level three there\u2019s a caos. A lot of monsters are destroying the city but when you destroy them, more appear! NPC\u2019s told that immortality gets you crazy. If you check your life, you can\u2019t die. Now become crazy while doing the combo again and you will warp to level 4.</li><li>Lia is broken and she knows it. She is blaming you for crashing their world. She will follow you while screaming. If you use the pause menu trick you will found a sign under a house. The sign says \u201cKill her\u201d. So slam Lia with your sword till you go to next level.</li><li>There\u2019s a golden door. You need 10 keys to go through it. If you don\u2019t have enough, more chests will spawn. But take care! There\u2019s no colliders, so you can get lost if you go so far away from the door! Once you have 10 keys (or if you already had them from the last chest spawning) talk to the door and a shower of stars will guide you. You will find Lia again. Talk to her and you will go to the next level.</li><li>And here we are! The final boss fight. Here you only must destroy the boss. But\u2026 Is the main core the real boss? Check which one of the 3 parts is the real boss and attack till it dies!</li><li>Congratulations! You finished! Thank you for playing the game!</li></ol>\n\n<p>Please write your thoughts in the comments!<br/>Hope you enjoyed it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:28:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/718/718706fd37eee3d9f6ca81e08bb12d7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Noar Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
