{"id": 727323, "slug": "calculords", "name": "Calculords", "name_original": "Calculords", "description": "<p>Calculords is based on the framework of a turn-based strategy game in which the player controls one side of three lanes and the opponent controls the other. Both sides attempt to destroy the other&#39;s base by sending troops towards it. Each base has a certain number of hit points; once those drop to zero, the base is destroyed and that side loses the game.</p>\n<p>The player draws cards from a virtual deck representing units. These units have numbers, while the player is given a set of numbers at the start of each turn. The player must perform mathematical equations to make their set of numbers equal the numbers on the cards, at which time they can deploy that particular card. The player receives bonuses if they are able to use the entire set of numbers in a single turn, which increases for each turn they can use all the numbers.</p>\n<p>Source: Wikipedia</p>\n<p>Additional info: http://www.calculords.com/game/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-27T00:37:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59f/59f4bc051226d32ed8bf372618e2cf8f.jpg", "website": "http://www.calculords.com/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Self-Published"], "esrb_rating": null}
