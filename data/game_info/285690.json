It's <strong>not</strong> a racing game.<br/><br/>The game is highly reminiscent of the <strong>80s</strong> with its neon lit nights and boasts original <strong>synthwave music</strong>. Its strong visual and sound identity allow the game to be appreciated by a growing community of <strong>retro lovers</strong> who crave the <strong>80s pop culture</strong>.<br/><br/>It is a multiplayer game meant for <strong>esport</strong>: it\u2019s made to be as fun to <strong>play</strong> as it is to<strong> watch</strong>. The main game mode is played with 4 players versus 4. You'll need some <strong>strategy</strong> and good <strong>communication</strong> to fight the enemy team.<br/><br/>Everyone gets the <strong>same car</strong> but what you do with it is your business. And you can <strong>totally customize it</strong>, not only the skin, but everything from the wheels to the motor, from the chassis to the battery, and so on. Each part comes from one of the <strong>27 country manufacturers</strong>.<br/><br/>To repel your opponents, you can simply <strong>rush over them</strong>. But to be <strong>more efficient</strong>, you can charge your battery by doing <strong>aerial tricks</strong> and use it to display \"hologram\" such as a <strong>bumper</strong> that return 5x the force of the collision to an opponent, or a <strong>jumper</strong> that allow your teammates to go on the other side of the convoy.About The Midnight Team<br/><strong>The Midnight Team</strong> is a young game studio composed by\u2026 only <strong>one person</strong>!
