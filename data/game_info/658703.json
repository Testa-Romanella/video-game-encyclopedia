I originally released this game in August 1992.</p>\n<p>Arazmax is a top-down\u00a0shooter/puzzle game. You control a disc-like ship and use the joystick to clear each maze-like level of multiplying enemies. The game was partly inspired by a shooter called Microbes, which featured a multiplying foe, and the look of the ship was inspired by Cosmic Pirate. Arazmax (the title came from the C64 game, Zamzara)\u00a0was my 6th Amiga game and a big step up from my previous games. It's still fun today.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.<br/></p><p>The main theme had a slightly flat note in the intro, so I've fixed this and\u00a0re-recorded the track using OctaMED and given it some 2021 audio space. Supplied here as an mp3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T09:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2d/f2de88e617d80163d343752edea68a24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
