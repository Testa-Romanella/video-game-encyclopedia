Select between variety of monsters and protect your land from weird goo.\u00a0Don't be fooled by selecting though. Bio Control isn't like your normal tower defense game. In Bio Control, many things are out of your control.</p>\n<p>To begin with, you cannot place your towers where you want. On the upside however, there are multiple types of towers with different abilities. By choosing the right towers, you will be able to beat each wave.<br/></p>\n<p>Not only you are out of control, but we are too. We have no idea how the enemies will spawn. Individually, groups of 1? groups of\u00a0 2? who knows?<br/><br/>Being out of control might seem hard, but with enough patience, you'll soon realize you are in control. Have fun.<br/><br/>Bio Control created by:</p>\n<ul><li>Aryan Abed-Esfahani</li><li>Sarah You</li></ul>\n<p>With special thanks to Daksh Malhotra.<br/><br/>All art assets were created by the team in the 48 hours time slot.<br/>Music Used: Bet on It</p>\n<p>NOTE: The game was made in less than 48 hours for GMTK 2020. It is indeed buggy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T04:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3c/e3cb747a22fb987561979789b37693b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["scoper"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
