The fact I choose is \"when Francis Drake and others Corsairs came to Brazil to steal redwood\", so I decided to create a game where the Corsairs battle against the Brazilian forces for the wood.</p><p>##Probably the Corsair will not be able to play with the joystick, but maybe you can if you change the inputs, in this case follow this inputs: HorP1 and HorP2 (left, right of the player 1 and 2), VerP1 and VerP2\u00a0(Up, down of the player 1 and 2), FireP1 and FireP2 (Shoot of the player 1 and 2), FireEspP1 and FireEspP2 (Special Shoot of the Player 1 and 2).
