It was originally created in 2017 as a personal challenge to build a game from scratch in less than a week. The game was completed in a few days, then abandoned in favor of other projects.\u00a0 Much later, I was looking through my old projects and decided, since Burglary was essentially finished, I might as well release it online for free.<br/>So I made some minor tweaks, added an alternate ending,\u00a0fixed a couple of bugs, and packaged it up.</p>\n<p>It's a very short, flawed game.
