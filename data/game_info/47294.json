Lots of video games\u201d, says Abdulla, Writer and Graphic Designer of Path Out. \u201cWhen my home turned into a war zone and during my escape I suddenly had to deal with very different circumstances... like spotting landmines or surviving a river ride in an oil barrel while crossing a border. I\u2019m looking forward to be able to share the beginning of my story in Path Out with players around the world\u201d.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/317/31716636566e026ec70e290ee68cb267.jpg", "website": "http://www.path-out.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 136, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Causa Creations"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Causa Creations"], "esrb_rating": null}
