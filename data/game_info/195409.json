I wanted to write a short, simple game that had a more linear easy to follow plot than my previous ones with a focus on comedy and a writing style inspired by the internet as opposed to proper grammar.</p>\n<p>Specifically, this game is about someone who texts and calls their dad to give advice and then goes on a date to a caf\u00e9. And that's... really it! I didn't want much meat on the bone this time. Simple, little game this one is.</p>\n<p>I sadly didn't have a (public) game in February due to commitments and this March game is a few days late due to other commitments but at least here it is! Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Oh and credit to my friend and patron James!
