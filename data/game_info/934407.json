Well, this game is exactly about that.</p>\n<p>You play as \"SOUL-E\",\u00a0 a soul who's on his way to heaven\u00a0 but has a change of mind and decides to stay at Earth. He wants to become alive again, but the demons from hell, jealous of his ascent to heaven,\u00a0won't allow him to become alive. Now, you have to fight all of the 5 demons from hell. Sounds easy enough? Well there are a couple of things to consider:</p>\n<p>1)\u00a0You can't attack them(you're a soul) unless your 'Time to attack' is non-zero. How does it become non-zero? By collecting soul orbs: yellow shiny orbs representing life. Each soul orb gives you 30 secs of combat power i.e. you become alive for 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>2) There's a bug intentionally left for the player to exploit. But it can just as easily lose you the game.</p>\n<p>The good news is, you fight one demon at a time. The bad news is, each time a new demon is spawned, that demon has enhanced power and agility. These demons spawn from the gates of Hell; really easy to locate.\u00a0You always have health orbs(green orbs) to replenish your health, but use them carefully since there are a limited amount of them.<br/><br/>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: movement<br/>Left Click: Attack<br/>Mouse Movement: look around.<br/></p>\n<p>Asset Packs used:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/little-ghost-free-229325<br/><br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/terrain-sample-asset-pack-145808<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made by: Shubh Singh.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T17:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1b/f1bf55eacc706411ab9e3dec5861b105.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShubhSingh"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
