In addition, it provides a safe and controlled environment for individuals to confront their fears and anxieties.<br/></p>\n<p>In our app, we utilized OpenAI's ChatGPT to take on the role of a professional therapist to provide meaningful insight into the user's situation and alleviate any stress someone may be going through.\u00a0This mixed with a grounding scenery and various tunes allows for the perfect meditative therapeutic session.</p><p>To play the game, you must have an OpenAI key. To do so, follow the ReadMe of the ChatGPT Unity Package: https://github.com/srcnalt/OpenAI-Unity.<br/></p>\n<p>In the future, we hope to have a server-side API running so that the individual does not need an API key to play the game. We also want to include customizability for scenery and voice by allowing the user to choose various options in a diegetic UI and possibly a scene editor to make their own scenes. Finally, we also plan on making a dynamic environment\u2014one that adapts to the user's tone of speech to fit the mood.</p><p>Thanks for checking out our project!
