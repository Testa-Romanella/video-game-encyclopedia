The demo takes you through the first level.<br/><br/>Story: Your name is Jack, you're a former Covert Ops member, recently retired and enjoying retirement at a vacation spot in Europe, when things take a hairy turn. You wake up to what sounds like an invasion, and then all goes quiet, people go about their business in the streets below...with the addition of militia men walking around on regular patrols or standing guard at key spots in the area. You remember seeing a payphone around the corner. Should probably call this in, and see what your former employers have to say.</p>\n<p>Standard controls:<br/>w=move forward, a=strafe left, s=move backward, d=strafe right, f=flashlight, numbers 1-3 on the number row scroll through weapons (only 3 available to pick up in the first level), 0=holster your weapon. Left click fires, right mouse button aims down sights, space bar to jump, c to crouch, left shift to run.<br/><br/>Currently having an issue making custom screens, so using the default menu from GameGuru for the demo. Will update with the new menu once I am able to.<br/><br/>Update includes: <br/>Custom made menu screens<br/>Patched the in-game menu issue.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T15:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bda/bda1e199eb0b2a3203d212a9601234f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sollid_SSC"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
