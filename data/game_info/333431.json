Time is limited, so move quickly!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The fight takes place in space, where \u2018up\u2019 is just a suggestion. You have full 360 degree freedom of movement, and momentum is key.<br/><br/>Boosting rockets you forward quickly but leaves a highly visible trail for your enemies to follow or avoid, use it sparingly.<br/><br/>Cut your engines to go dark, allowing you to coast through areas silently, to either avoid, or ambush enemies.<br/><br/>Hiding is no coward's move! Runners can hide in foliage, smoke or behind debris remain undetected, but be wary as Hunters may use the same spaces to stalk their prey\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>What good is a ride without a paint job?! Choose from a number of ships on both sides, be it the nimble Sparrow, the powerful Trailblazer, or the menacing Scythe.
