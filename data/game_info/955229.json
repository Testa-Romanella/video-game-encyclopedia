Quest through the separate realms of Sky and Earth to find 99 golden potatoes, and bring the world back into unity! Beware the fierce creatures that guard these auric tubers. Use magic to assist you when needed, but use it wisely. Seek out the six staircases that remain the only link the between the realms.\"</p>\n<p>\r\nSubmitted for Dungeon Crawler Jam 2023, the theme of \"duality\" is expressed by the divison of the world into two realms (effectively two levels within the game).<br/></p>\n<p>In keeping with the style of very early text/adventure games, Spuds of Gold has no audio.</p>\n<p>For Windows version only: the correct version of SDL2.dll must be present <em>in the same directory as the executable</em>.
