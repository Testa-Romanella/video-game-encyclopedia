Via their <strong>elemental types</strong> (Neutral, Fire, Water, Ice, Plant, Lightning, Air, and Earth), Abomis in a different time utilized <strong>power</strong> and <strong>strategy</strong> to dominate each other. After becoming civilized, most Abomis tended to forget about their violent history. But, now, as a <strong>powerful threat emerges</strong>, your team will have to <strong>rediscover their powers</strong> and fight for Abomi Nation's safety.<br/><br/><h3>Explore a Nation unique to your playthrough!</h3>Every run of Abomi Nation will <strong>generate a uniquely-shaped island</strong> for your team to traverse, offering up a <strong>different combination</strong> of areas, bosses, and Abomis to recruit <strong>every time you play</strong>! <strong>Replayability</strong> is a main focus of Abomi Nation.<br/><br/>There will always be ways to <strong>tweak your game's settings</strong> to keep each new run <strong>feeling fresh</strong>.

You'll have the freedom to play the game in a length and manner that <strong>suits you</strong>.<h3>Watch your team bond!</h3><strong>No two teams will be alike</strong> in Abomi Nation thanks to the myriad of <strong>randomized factors</strong> that go into each run. Abomis have <strong>different personalities</strong> from one another, and this will impact how multiple Abomis <strong>react</strong> to the same situation. As your adventure unfolds, the <strong>bond</strong> between any two Abomis will <strong>grow</strong>, causing them to <strong>behave differently</strong> when their friends are in danger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not everything in Abomi Nation is about fighting. Experience <strong>cuteness overload</strong> while you <strong>boost your team\u2019s stats</strong> by eating together, playing <strong>minigames</strong>, and participating in all sorts of <strong>events</strong> offered by friendly townsfolk.
