There is every intention of improvement.<br/></p>\n<p>The concept is fairly loose at this point in time, the ship can be rotated and accelerated, the turret follows the mouse and fires using left click. Space turns on the gravity to collect particles the laser burns off the asteroids. The gravity can be adjusted with the scroll wheel.</p>\n<p>There is no story as of yet, or real goal. I love it however and will definitely be expanding this soon.</p>\n<p>This could very fairly be called more of a prototype than a game. Having said that, I enjoy it thoroughly, and I hope other people will too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/69362b80a9ae42c27c50e92f601187bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BetaJester"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
