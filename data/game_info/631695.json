A brand new cleaning product? A type of pink car dice perhaps? No, you idiot. It's a new video game featuring everyone's favourite tie wearing robot with a boring 9 to 5 job; Eugene. Eugene is just your average cleaning robot on a spaceship, but that's all about to change when a workplace accident causes him to be sucked out of an airlock. Thrown into a world of madness, Eugene will do whatever it takes to make it back home...<br/><br/>Take control of Eugene as he tries to navigate this insane world, which way will lead him home safely and which way will lead to a DEAD end? With Branching paths and many situations to play through getting home safe is harder than it might seem<br/><br/>It's wacky fun designed to annoy the player and prevent them from reaching their goal of getting our hero back home! This game benefits from re-playing with different choices.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:12:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b6/3b693a57edb80e469f9f652b47cfdb62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ballistic Machine"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
