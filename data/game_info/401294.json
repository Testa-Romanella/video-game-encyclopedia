Sebastian, the protagonist of the game, can change their lives tremendously. But you will decide how. </p>\n<p><strong>Lucy</strong> is a passionate and energetic woman, who's playing in the theater and wants to become a good actress. Will Sebastien be able to help her or will find another place in another industry for her?</p>\n<p><strong>Kate and Ashley</strong>\u00a0- sweet naive orphans with a hard life.\u00a0 All they want is just to make their cozy cafe work again. Without experience, they won't be able to run it on their own. Will you help them to make their dreams come true or will you take advantage of their naivety?</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Melanie</strong> is an exemplary school teacher, a good housewife who thinks only of her beautiful daughter.</p>\n<p><strong>Tiffany\u00a0</strong>is a college student and a cheerleader. And... she hates the main hero.</p>\n<p>Will Sebastien make daughter and mother fall in love with him, or will he corrupt and blackmail them?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane</strong> - It's just Jane. A naive and kind girl who fell in love with you.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>A word from the developer.\u00a0<br/></strong>Hi. The game is at an early stage of development and this is the perfect time for you to influence the project with your feedback and support. You can do it on my Patreon page,\u00a0Discord, or\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>If you're thinking right now: \"Oh, let's see how this guy develops his game first. If he does well, I'll consider pledging.\" But you'll be missing the perfect timing to support the project. Because it is at an early stage of development, your support now will have the greatest influence in shaping the game. I'm a small developer, I don't have a team or enough resources to further improve the game without your help.</p>\n<p>It's totally okay if you can't support me with your money though, because the best thing that you can do to show your appreciation is to <strong>share your opinion, message me on discord, put my signature on game forums, tell a friend, anything you can think of to spread the word about the project.</strong> If you wish to see the continuation and improvement of the game, then you can take an active part by helping promote the game. And that would also be appreciated! It's just another way of contributing and helping the game fulfill its potential!</p>\n<p>I have a lot of ambitious ideas and I'm not going to stop no matter what, but your support will help me to achieve results 10 times faster!</p>\n<p>There's a whole lot of things I can do. And it's a long way to go.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thank you for taking your time to read this.</p>\n<p><em>Enyo.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T03:31:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cdcafcead8bca6be5be47a17c49fe10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 2, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["enyo_1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
