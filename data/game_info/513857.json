I wanted to test my abilities as a developer, push the limits of RPG Maker, and see whether or not players like this type of game and would like to see more of it. By no means do I plan to make a <em>Phasmophobia: RPG Maker Edition.</em> Phasmophobia is created by Kinetic Games and belongs to them. This game is the final and full version and (outside of bug fixes) will not be updated any more than this. However, if you found this enjoyable, please let me know down below! Based on the reception of this game will determine where I go from here :)</p>\n<p><strong>Watch me make this game!</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>\"Hello Hello. Good to see you again. We have several ghosts to investigate.\" You play as a Paranormal Ghost Investigator and word on the street is that there's a home that is 'very haunted.' However, you're not just some typical ghost investigator. You know your ghouls. You know when whether its a demon, jinn, poltergeist, revenant, or spirit\u00a0. And that's what make you better than all the rest.</p>\n<p>With your paranormal detective tools and ghost handbook, you enter the house, head-first, and\u00a0\u00a0come out knowing exactly what's there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>- This is a fan-made game of Phasmophobia but created in a different environment (2D/overhead as opposed to 3D/first person) using the game making engine <em>RPG Maker MZ</em></p>\n<p>- Several equipment has been excluded from the Phasmophobia Universe</p>\n<p>- Certain items includes different features (i.e. video camera can be accessed remotely)</p>\n<p>- Inventory is limitless</p>\n<p>- Several Easter eggs</p>\n<p>- Other adjustments for a better solo-experience</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The Future &amp; What You Can Do</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned in the disclaimer, this game stops here. The future of this project are in your hands. If you enjoyed, please let me know below! For those who would like to\u00a0donate, THANK YOU!
