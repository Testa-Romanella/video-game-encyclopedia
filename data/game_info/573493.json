{"id": 573493, "slug": "the-last-station", "name": "The Last Station", "name_original": "The Last Station", "description": "<p>For course project. My first finished project using GB Studio.<br/></p>\n<p>Uses the 'overlay' element of a gameboy dynamically to create a 'void' which the player must escape from. The void, as of right now, is coded to increment every 2 second, but may become faster (or slower) later on in development if I ever come back to this. If you are caught in the void, you lose and can start another run. Importantly, you can go into the void and come back out, just don't be inside of it at the moment that it increments.<br/></p>\n<p>Uses RNG each run which enables the potential for 1 of any 3 different mazes to be used for each of the 3 levels. <br/></p>\n<p>Get to the final 4th level, the last station, in order to win.</p>\n<p>Cheating (by pressing enter in game) = disables collisions so you can go through the mazes easily. May make you go through the level and end up on the other side, and if the void is there, it will make you lose the game.</p>\n<p>-=-=-=-=-=-</p>\n<p>Versions:</p>\n<p>First Draft: Has many problems. Simply here to be preserved.</p>\n<p>The_Last_Station (Progressive Void): The same as the void jump version, but instead of the void jumping to the scene you are on, progresses as it would if it were slowly eating a world, going from scene to scene in the appropriate amount of time it would take, and getting to you in its own time. In other words, if you go to the next maze, it will not follow you to that room until it has finished with the prior one. This version is less fun.<br/></p>\n<p>The_Last_Station (Void Jumping) [the playable one in the browser]: Void jumps to the scene the player is on, making getting through mazes more intense.<br/>-=-=-=-=-=</p>\n<p>Controls for mobile:<br/></p>\n<p>A = Enter</p>\n<p>B = Shift<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T05:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c62/c625f4ac3709b611f22ba23df43396b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarredAllseer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
