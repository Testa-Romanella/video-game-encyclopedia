Mixed in with word processing and account balancing software, the diskette was lost to time - only spoken of in geocities webpages deleted and purged from history. Your intrigue gets the better of you and you decide to take it home and try it on your old 386. The disk spins to life immediately when locked into its drive; seemingly revitalizing the dusty hardware.</p>\n<p>&gt;dir</p>\n<p>25d.dll</p>\n<p>pax.exe</p>\n<p>rsc</p>\n<p>&gt;pax.exe</p>\n<p>The machine whirs and grinds with the sound of mechanical drives.
