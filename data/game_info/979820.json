{"id": 979820, "slug": "the-scar-2", "name": "The Scar", "name_original": "The Scar", "description": "The earth is contaminated, there are hardly any people left alive. Human pride reaches its climax with the use of AI to generate a wormhole to another planet. During the opening, energy from another three-dimensional reality leaks into our atmosphere. Humanity falls in just 30 days due to the radiation of said energy, and those who do not die, mutate into wild beasts without reason.Only a few with specific genetics manage to resist the radiation. Find the research centers, find out what happened and try to reverse the situation.<h3>Explore:</h3>Walk, swim, run or use spatial displacement. You can choose a procedurally generated map of 36, 81 or 225 square kilometers, which will make each game different. Choose the size based on how long you want the game to last.<br/><br/><h3>Create custom weapons:</h3>Forge your own weapons and tools, choose materials, and give the ingot a custom shape to maximize its characteristics. With this forging system the only limit is your imagination.<br/><br/><h3>Build:</h3>Use the materials in your environment to make buildings of wood, stone, iron and steel. Build multiple shelters to store resources as you move around the huge map.<br/><br/><h3>Investigate abandoned facilities:</h3>The wormhole opening experiment was composed of multiple research and development centers, which conducted different experiments and contributed resources to the operations center. You'll have to find them and figure out how to get them back up and running.<br/><br/><h3>Fight your way:</h3>As you advance through the world you will encounter mutated humans, beings that have lost the use of reason and will attack without hesitation. But it won't be the only danger, hordes of aliens arrive from the target planet of the experiment with the aim of stopping you at any cost.<br/><br/><h3>Use the summons:</h3>The energy leaked into the atmosphere through the wormhole is nothing more than the fragmented body of Ashun, a huge being from another three-dimensional reality. You will have to ally with him to be able to reopen the hole and save the earth from contamination. While he is with you you can summon the energy of his reality into our world, granting you unparalleled power.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T08:03:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/652/652ff934348ff9341f8ac5ee6624ce57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cerval Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cerval Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
