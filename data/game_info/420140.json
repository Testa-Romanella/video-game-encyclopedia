{"id": 420140, "slug": "ink-itch-nate-smith", "name": "INK (itch) (Nate Smith)", "name_original": "INK (itch) (Nate Smith)", "description": "<p>INK is an ultra-realistic\u00a0tattooing simulation experience, wherein the player must re-create my tattoos on an anatomically-correct, photo-realistic 3D model of my body. I chose this topic because as I was thinking about meaningful moments in my life, I kept thinking about the meaningful experiences I've had getting tattoos and I wanted to see if I could recreate that in a game.</p>\n<p>INK is very much in the vein of my past games - simple concept, horrible (or at least clunky)\u00a0controls. I had a really simple plan (a tattoo machine moves along and around a round body and it uses a LineRenderer to make the tattoo)\u00a0\u00a0and I finished it relatively quickly within the first 3 weeks. The last part of development was all of the fluff around that - pause screens, UI, scene transitions, sound + music etc. The most fun part for me surprisingly was working on the music, making the models, and watching it all come together. The least fun parts (and the parts I had the most difficulty stopping) was bringing all the separate elements together and with scene transitions and management of functionality between different scripts. My best decisions were just around coding - which classes I made static instances, which I employed inheritance in etc. I think the code just works pretty well and is pretty straightforward. Additionally, I'm really glad I fully commented it so that I can use it as a portfolio piece. My worst decision was probably just the subject matter, because Unity isn't particularly well set-up for that kind of game, but in the end I think it turned out well.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T02:44:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e08/e08af10bc73507edc0141d1cc1632450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nate Smith"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
