In this game, your goal is to mess up the kitchen as much as possible. But there\u2019s a catch, your mom is at home. Luckily, she will be listening to music, which covers some of the noise. Be careful though, as she may stop the music any second. Luckily, there will be tasks that can be done without making a single sound. If you got cat food, your cat may well be your best companion!</p>\r\nInstructions:\r\nBreak all the kitchen utensils without Mom knowing!\r\n<p>You'll hear occasional pauses of the background music, that's when Mom pauses the music she's listening to, so be careful! She'll suspect you if you make any noise when breaking things and she might come in earlier.</p>\r\nSpecial tasks to make Mom even angrier!\r\n<ul><li>Fridge - the yellow slots part is the freezer, while the top part is the refrigerator. The task is to drag all the food to\u00a0the opposite area so that everything is spoiled.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Rug - spill soy sauce onto the rug by clicking onto it. Your goal is to ruin the whole rug.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Oven: Keep spinning the knob until it breaks.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Stove - Try your best to click onto the background when the bar touches the center (red line) where the heat is at maximum. Your goal is to overheat the stove.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nYour cat may well be your best companion!\r\n<p>Whenever you find cat food, you can summon your pet cat, Cath Palug. Cath Palug will then distract Mom for 10 secs, which allows you to have even more time to mess up the kitchen.</p>\r\nOur Team:\r\n<ul><li>Kawaiinyanko @silentknightgames\u00a0(Programmer)</li><li>DummyGirlXD (Programmer)</li><li>Hoi @hooooi_ (Artist)</li><li>Enji @enji.scribbles (Artist)</li></ul>\n<p>This game was intended to be submitted to the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2, where the theme is \"Let there be chaos\". Unfortunately, we noticed that it couldn't be run\u00a0at the last minute of the submission time. Since we don't want to waste the hard work and effort we've put into the project, and we still want to be involved in the game jam and interact with other participants, we decided to publish it again here. \u00a0Although we might not get a ranking, game jams are\u00a0all about fun and improvements, right?<br/></p>\n<p>P.S. Thanks for all the supports and comments from other game jammers. You all\u00a0mean a lot to us. Cheers!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:38:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db2285a97187fea74104f5f1cc7b545c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Silent Knight Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
