Using the latest 20th-century technology, this machine will shrink your head with cutting-edge, 1950s science!</p><p>Built for Ludum Dare 49 (a 72 hour game jam), The Auto-Analyst was made using Twine 2.3.14, Harlowe 3.2.2 and HAL v.2.2.1.</p><p>This was my first game jam and I had a blast! This was also my first project in Twine/Harlowe and I really enjoyed exploring them both. I'm looking forward to using these tools for larger projects in the future - maybe a visual novel.</p><p>In any event, I hope you enjoy this humble attempt to entertain. Thanks for taking a look!</p><p>Twitter: @chainsawmcd</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/939/9397a418c700b025e3134a726a67263a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChainsawMcD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
