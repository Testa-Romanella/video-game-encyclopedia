However, it would also alter the physique of anyone who grab it, and people that got into contact with it would take the appearance of white skinned beings with horns. This power has served them as leverage in dominating this far too perfect world. With it, they would get much more freedom, and were able to uncover a long buried mankind flaw: thirst for conquest and power.\r\n</p>\n<p>This thirst is what today eats away at the very principle of Dream Haven. To oppose these evil deeds that transgressed the morale and fundamentals of freedom upon which they were founded, elite units were created. These units, named \u201cPanzer Knights\u201d, had a sole purpose: to learn the secrets of a mystical art called the \u201cFlux\u201d, a power created to counter those who had fragments of the Moon Rock. They would also use it as a way to revert their damage, and brush up the painting of this world that had become imperfect.\r\n</p>\n<p>After a relentless struggle that would last far too long, the Panzer Knights were finally able to vanquish the dark ambitions of this group of crazed beings, by turning back their own magic against themselves. This battle wouldn\u2019t leave only a great many casualties, most people also kept a vivid memory of this event, an almost indelible scar that would stay under the eyes of them all for a long time yet: the Panzer Knights\u2019 main HQ, struck off the map, leaving behind a huge crater devoid of any life, sealed, still reeking of war. Despite most of the Panzer Knights vanishing during these events, many remained, keeping a watchful eye on the state of this once more benevolent world.\r\n</p>\n<p>Sion Orta Alexandria is the offspring of Panzer Knight Sastasha Kashua,\u00a0 leader of the Epsilon elite squad. Following the war, Sastasha had disappeared, after tasking Sion with overseeing and learning all of Dream Haven secrets, but also the origins of this Moon Rock, and how it corrupted so many people by turning them into the power-hungry \u201cCelestials\u201d. Hidden in the buried temple of Alexandria, our prodigy and her friend Marianne would experience out of the ordinary adventures, and discover disturbing truths on what was brewing in their supposedly perfect world.</p>\n<p>In present days\u00a0at the Archives of the buried Great Alexandria Library, located in Vendest. Sion Orta Alexandria spends her days browsing her magical textbooks, looking to learn about magical diversity and Flux cores.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our young protagonist is often alone, and is taking care of the premises when she gets bored.\r\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes, her best friend, Marianne Mirakuru, a young Panzer Knight recruit from Vennord, would come to visit Sion in order to spar with her, or talk about adventures she goes on during her scouting missions.\r\n</p>\n<p>One day, during the long Autumn, Marianne came to Sion hastily to alert her about a great threat coming from Vendouest. She warned her that she\u2019d have to act quickly, as otherwise magical instabilities would affect and weaken all of Dream Haven\u2019s regions.\r\n</p>\n<p>A reconnaissance mission that had been undertaken by Marianne\u2019s group found out that a group of unknown emissaries were absorbing the Flux, thus disrupting the vital energy of their world.\r\n</p>\n<p>To ensure the issue is properly addressed, the player has the choice between Sion Orta, the young magician prodigy, or Marianne Mirakuru, the young Panzer Knight recruit.\r\n</p>\r\n-Main Controls-\r\n\n<p>You can play with controller\u00a0or keyboard.<br/></p>\n<p>Controller\u00a0works automatically when game boots, as long as the controller is plugged.</p>\n<p>No keybinding required for controller to work, automatically switches between keyboard and controller when input is detected from one or the other</p>\n<p>Default settings: Shot \"W(azerty) or Y(qwertz) or Z(qwerty)\" / Bomb \"X\" / Dodge \"Shift\" /Pause \"Esc\" / Screenshot \"HOME\" / Retry \"R \"</p>\r\n-Language-\r\n<p>-English</p>\n<p>-Available later: French, Japanese, Mandarin, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish and Italian.</p>\r\n\r\n-More Informations-\r\n<p>https://twitter.com/Hamknightsoft</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T14:22:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f31/f31e319279dd1958d6ccd4f6eada06c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HamKnight Soft"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
