We tried to take the theme in a bit of a different direction by exploring it's definition. We discovered a genre of music called \"Glitch Hop\" that we didn't know about. This genre uses glitch-based audio to create music with the idea of an \"aesthetic of failure\". So we decided to go with something similar. The idea is that the player must fail in order to succeed and so we tried to infuse that idea in our game the best we could in 48 hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c0881d93e6e791f6002468e9357e79dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KSU GDC"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
