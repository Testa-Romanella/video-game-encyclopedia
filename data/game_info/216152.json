When a person is inside your radius, he gets annoyed by your dance/singing.<br/></p>\n<p>You must<strong> annoy the people in order to reduce their patience</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>When their patience reach their limit, they shoot you </strong>(and their patience returns to their minimum).<strong> You must use\u00a0their bullets to destroy them.</strong></p>\n<p>When the people is out of your radius, they start to recover patience at their own pace (some people recovers faster than others, so they forget you eassily).</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: Enemies don't harm you if you touch them, only their\u00a0bullets.</strong></p>\n<p>Killing different people with a single shoot adds a bonus to the score.</p>\n<p>I hadn't time to show it visually, but some<strong> people are \"emotionally linked\"</strong> (When you annoy someone linked to another one, the one who is linked to that person, even if is not inside your radius, gets annoyed too).</p>\r\nSome thoughts\r\n<p>The game is on a very early stage. There are some bugs (for example, when you die, you can continue controlling the player). I had to sacrifice some things (art, animations) in order to focus on gameplay and to solve bugs.</p>\n<p>I considered that the game concept where more relevant in the jam than the art.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But I don't like when I make an ugly game haha.</p>\n<p>Also, I'd have liked to had the time for making and adding a sound when they hurt you, to increase the feedback.</p>\n<p>I also spent a bit more time\u00a0than usual creating sounds and\u00a0I didn't had the time to implement all the mechanics I thought.</p>\n<p>But I'm so fruwsirasdfjh proud of the music! Hahaha.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you are here reading this, and have played the game, thanks! :)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Made in one day and a half, by \u00d3scar RB (@chocoboflo)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/172d40711cb5e0f7394b58b61ba26491.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Suzuka"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
