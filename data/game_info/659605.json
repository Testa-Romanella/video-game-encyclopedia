Use the station's rotation to grab and launch small asteroids towards the attackers, and replenish your supply of rocks by breaking up larger ones with the mining laser. Maybe, just maybe, you might survive.</p><p>Control your scoop's extension with up/w and down/d and release caught asteroids with space. Fire your mining laser with f to break up larger asteroids.</p>\n\n<p>This was made in 48 hours for the Kenny Jam 2021, so please bear in mind this is my first game jam, but I hope I've delivered a good game nonetheless. Thank you for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04d/04d27e8a858bb73191cc33a45e569991.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MattBann"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
