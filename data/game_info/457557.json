I made this game for my boyfriend's birthday ^^</p>\n<p><strong>WARNINGS:</strong> White flashes in cutscenes and battles, swearing, humorous depiction of religion (catholicism), incredibly subtle dirty humor like blink and you'll miss it</p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>the opening animation could freeze in the second panel (of Byubyu and Wire sleeping). If it appears to freeze just close and restart. It can take a few tries to get it to not freeze. Sorry if this happens!\u00a0It's an unfixable bug that occurs in RPG\u00a0Maker MV games</li><li>It's unlikely (only happened to me once) but it can freeze in-battle or in the overworld. So please save as often as you can.</li><li>if you cannot choose between enemies with arrow keys in-battle you have to just take your cursor off of them (or use cursor to select enemies)</li></ul>\n\n<p>Story, art, animation, music - Lyn</p>\n<p>Trivia music transcribed to midi by\u00a0- Difa Kresnawan</p>\n<p>SFX (creative commons sounds made by users on freesound.org)<br/>Josepharaoh99,\u00a0MrtheNoronha,\u00a0Mattix,\u00a0Pumodi,\u00a0Astrand,\u00a0Joao Janz,\u00a0Lulyc,\u00a0Cabled Mess,\u00a0TheBuilder15,\u00a0Rhodesmas,\u00a0Prof Mudkip,\u00a0EVRetro,\u00a0Owlstorm</p>\n<p>Plugins -\u00a0Yanfly, Irina, Galv, SRD, Moghunter, Tamfey</p>\n<p>Troubleshooting - MightyEgg</p>\n<p>Moral support/testing\u00a0-\u00a0Endshark/Byuby</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T04:44:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/226/2265c84990b5a9f7ff0b8b7318819858.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LYN"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
