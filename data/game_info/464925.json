{"id": 464925, "slug": "curse-of-the-black-horse", "name": "Curse of the Black Horse", "name_original": "Curse of the Black Horse", "description": "<p>Find the horse - avoid death (somehow).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once a year, you are cursed with the appearance of a black horse chess piece, appearing somewhere in your house to spread mischief. Find the horse, get rid of it before the time runs out, or suffer the consequences.</p>\n<p>I am a complete Unity amateur (and a Blender amateur too, hence all the free assets), so I\u00a0didn't get to include my initial idea of randomised events happening throughout the house as you're looking for the horse. Think the oven catching on fire, a plug malfunctioning, the bath filling with water, the light going out, and so on. My idea was to have the players be able to fix events before they permanently got worse (like fixing faulty cables with duct tape or use a fire extinguisher to remove fire hazards), to balance the harmful consequences with the hide and seek element. Since I\u00a0had no time to figure out how to make random events happen, I\u00a0ended up with a standard time-until-death timer instead. The game is functional, though simple as it is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite not exactly getting to where I\u00a0wanted, I am still proud of what I\u00a0achieved in 48 hours. Hopefully the next GMTK\u00a0game jam will go even better.</p><p>OBJECTIVE:</p><p>- Find the cursed black horse piece and drop it in the bin. It can be hidden in several locations around the house. Check behind pillows or in drawers. It can be in the tub, too! Good luck finding it there.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>- Mouse to look.</p>\n<p>- WASD to move.</p>\n<p>- E to interact (with drawers and objects)</p><p>BUGS:</p><p>- Yes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:58:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/574/5746831017d1a367ca40e851e093c3b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bearhunter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
