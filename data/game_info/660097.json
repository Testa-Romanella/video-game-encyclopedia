The concept of the game is that you are traveling through a series of difficult to get through mazes where the walls are the real danger, as well as spikes. Oh, and did I\u00a0mention the fact that the only way to traverse is to move your mouse? Anyway, there are only 3 levels so far, and most likely a\u00a0 lot of bugs. This was meant to be a game jam game but I\u00a0was busy and missed the deadline. Anyways, have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T16:09:45", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["undeadbomb"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
