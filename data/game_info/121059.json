Besides the button to start the game, the game is all controlled by typing words. Underline words in the world will perform an action, such as gathering a resource or constructing a building. The game is over when you complete the castle, and you will be scored on time and words per minute. Let me know how you did!</p>\n<p>The game was made in Unity, using TextMeshPro, ProBuilder, and Polybrush. (Which are all put out as free assets by unity themselves. I highly recommend them!) Music is procedural generated by Wolfram Tones, which is always fun to use.</p>\n<p>This was a solo project, though models were created by me, a few of the textures and the sound effects are not created by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dff/dffd3e04c956f156446b8e256f9e695c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kleinzach"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
