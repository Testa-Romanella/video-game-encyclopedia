{"id": 740600, "slug": "starshifter-demo", "name": "Starshifter Demo", "name_original": "Starshifter Demo", "description": "<p>You play as Coyote, one of the Guardians tasked with maintaining balance on the earth. \u00a0Each Guardian has been gifted a power by the stars to help them protect the land and animals, but Coyote has no powers. One evening, a meteor shower causes the stars to fall from the sky, rendering the animals powerless to the spirits of the night who wish to reclaim the stars for themselves. Coyote, the only one used to being powerless, now takes up the Guardian role to put the stars back. Coyote learns how to harness their new shapeshifting ability and uses it to explore farther than they ever could before.<br/><br/><br/>\r\nThis is Coyotic Games' first tech demo release for \"Starshifter\"! It's VERY much a work in progress, expect to see bugs!\u00a0Quests, textures and the layout of the map may change on release. We're running an Indiegogo campaign and planning a finished release on Steam later.
