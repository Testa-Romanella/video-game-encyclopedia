{"id": 586608, "slug": "mario-chase-networked-clone", "name": "Mario Chase Networked Clone", "name_original": "Mario Chase Networked Clone", "description": "<p>This is a networked\u00a0clone of NintendoLand's Mario Chase mini-game on the WiiU. The original game is part of a mini-game collection in NintendoLand to show off the WiiU gamepad with a lot of multiplayer games, but it was only local multiplayer. This version allows online networking for people to play together and currently only includes the first map. I've done my best to keep the game as close to the original as possible.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Game map is balanced for 4-5 people as I did not import the 2-3 player map version.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY (4-5 Players)</strong></p>\n<p>The game involves one person as Mario and the rest as Toads. The Mario must run away and survive for 2:30 minutes while the Toads must catch him. Mario has a top-down view of the map and knows all locations of every player. The Toads have a 3rd person view and can only tell how far away they are from Mario. After 60 seconds have passed, a power-up star spawns in the middle of the map that gives Mario invincibility for 20 seconds if obtained. If it's not picked up when 60 seconds remains, the star disappears.</p>\n<p><strong>CONNECTING</strong></p>\n<p>Enter any username you want to identify yourself to friends and enter a room name to create a room. The first person to enter the room is the host and everyone else who enters the same room name will join. Currently, only US East and US West are used as the hub for connecting people.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard (no mouse look)<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys\u00a0for movement</li><li>Space to tackle as a Toad</li></ul></li><li>Gamepad support (tested with Xbox 360 Controller)<ul><li>Left joystick for movement</li><li>A to tackle as Toad</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>ART/ASSETS<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>3D model of the map, Mario, and Toad\u00a0are obtained from the WiiU game directly and converted and retextured for PC.</li><li>\"Mii\" by alexanderjones.itguy is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution. https://skfb.ly/6SKIO</li></ul>\n<p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong></p>\n<p>This was a small prototype to have a networked version of the game working.
