For our first game, see Hell Shower.<br/>We participated at BUG once again. The place is like home to us. \r\n<p><strong>The game:<br/></strong>You are in the hospital, unable to move. The doctor desperately wants to see some hope. The least you can do is moving one toe. But can you do it?</p>\n<p><strong>The making of the game:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>We used Construct 2 and given that it's the free version, the number of events that take place is no more than 100. </li><li>Once again our game lacks sound. We'll make up for that in our next game. We have pause and restart options this time, don't we?</li><li>We know the game is quite difficult. It's meant to be that way.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:18:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dd/7dd416108073f8d78cee6ab02dc55f42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ilky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
