You show your daughter, and you both dive into a whole new world.</p>\n<p>You play as the brave knight, and your daughter plays as the princess. It's your mission as the knight to escort the princess back to the castle. Be careful though. There will be obstacles and monsters trying to prevent you from reaching the castle. So you will have to jump and slash your way to the castle in this story driven game that's\u00a0telling a touching story about a father trying to spend time with his daughter.</p>\n<p>This game was originally created for a game jam. The idea was to fully flesh out a story between a father and his daughter, who would grow up while the puppet show was being finished. But the scope was too big, so we cut it down to the first piece. And even with it being cut, it still took us several months to finish it.\u00a0But it's finally done and playable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And just in time as I, Tom Devaney, found out a few months ago\u00a0that I'm going to be having a baby! So this story just became a whole lot more relevant.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:11:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0b/f0b5d9c0a5f20ee88c03cadd92dfad36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TomDevaney"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
