My game is called Home, not like your house. The game title will make sense in later versions. This game is in an early stage. There is no tutorial yet, so I'm just going to tell you what to do here. This game right now is about surviving enemies and obtaining items. You move with WASD. To use items you use the LEFT and RIGHT mouse buttons. To switch arrow types, press Q and E to cycle through them. You have a companion, control him by using Z, X and C. To save the game press 1, but move around after. To interact with objects, press ENTER. If you see any bugs or glitches, please comment on this page or contact me. My email is campgamer0129@gmail.com. Have fun :)</p>\n\n<p>This game will ALWAYS be free</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T07:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1d/b1d7649af62e3703dc0293e8c2c80bf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CampGamer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
