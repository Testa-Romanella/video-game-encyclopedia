This premise is supported with a strong, non-linear storyline and stunning combat sequences. The world comes to life as it immediately reacts to the player&#39;s actions and changes accordingly - offering new and exciting challenges.</p>", "metacritic": 58, "released": "2007-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-02T19:06:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d2d/d2d2cf12c4d2e1b558b3827ae73d986f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 531, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Reality Pump"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["TopWare Interactive", "SouthPeak Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
