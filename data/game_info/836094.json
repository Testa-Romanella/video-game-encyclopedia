Also there's a friendly little fox waiting to see you\u00a0at the end of each level.</p><p>A tip: if you are on a wall and press a directional key then jump you will jump in that direction. Use this to jump to different walls or jump up walls faster.</p>\n<p>(no in game sound as of now)</p>\n\n<p>This project has no real name and is tagged as \"prototype\" because I did not originally intend on making a platformer. This is a stepping stone to the platform fighter I intended on making but it serves as a demo for the mechanics I have made so far. Reviews are greatly appreciated to help me make the project more fun.</p>\n<p>This project was also not originally intended to be a web game that ran in the browser but I saw that I could so I did to allow for more accessibility but testing for this was not extensive so the downloaded version will be better, at least visually.</p>\n\n<p>All art was found here on itch. Check out the credits from the main menu to see all the artists.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T12:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7a/f7a6033bafd1a74194de670d8960dcb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["PantheraOnline"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
