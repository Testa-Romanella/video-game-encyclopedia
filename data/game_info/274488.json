God has chosen you to save Earth from a fiery end, and your only hope for salvation is finding a sacrifice. The only problem: the sacrifice must be in love with you. You must seduce Goat: a budding writer who is also a goat. Will you and your relationship survive the end of the world?</p>\n<p>This game has five endings, can you find them all?</p>\n<p>Hint: The minigames do matter! Your performance in them can unlock more dialogue options and other endings. We were too rushed to add a proper tutorial, but it's a simple \"right choice, right place\" game similar to the board game \"Mastermind\". You must perform the correct choices in the correct order to get maximum points. There CAN be duplicate choices though!\u00a0</p>\r\nOur team:\r\n<p>Project Lead/Lead Programmer: Saul Amster</p>\n<p>Programmer: Aidan Saltini</p>\n<p>Lead Writer: Julia LaCava</p>\n<p>Writers: Emma Herbst and Kristen Gregg</p>\r\nThank you! And enjoy!\r\n<p>The \"FIXED_POST\" version is the updated version that fixes some of the game breaking bugs (depending on your playthrough). It was\u00a0made after the Jam time was over, so if you want the original (possibly broken) experience play the non \"FIXED_POST\" game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a34/a34becb2ed4a2b4a12cb8ef06dd32b20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Blarfnip"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
