You are consigned to a galactic husk, long since starved of civilization, but still playing host to its hubris. GYGA was created to fulfill the end of history, but succeeded beyond its creators intent. A supercomputer, corrupted by entropy and bound to the planets core, feeds off data to stay alive and is the only thing staving off the collapse of reality. Also, there is a lobster. Capture rogue automatons and saddle them onto the immortal crustacean to cast the robotic prey into the maw of GYGA. The more the mechanical teeth gnash, the more you KEEP IT ALIVE, but be warned, there is no sacrifice too great for GYGA. Do you smell toast or is that just me?\r\n</p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<p>Kill Robots and grab their power cores.\r\nToss them to your lobster, and press F (Y on controller) to send him to GYGA.\r\nDifficulty will ramp once you have satisfied GYGA.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Computer</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD\u00a0 - Movement</li><li>Mouse\u00a0 - Aim</li><li>Space Bar - Jump</li><li>E\u00a0 - Pickup Item</li><li>F\u00a0 - Toggle Lobster follow/turn in.</li><li>G\u00a0 - Drop Item</li><li>Left Click - Attack / Throw</li><li>[1][2][3][4] - Weapon/Item Select (Computer)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controller</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Left Stick - Movement</li><li>Right Stick - Aim</li><li>A button - Jump</li><li>X button - Pickup Item</li><li>Y Button - Toggle Lobster follow/turn in.</li><li>B Button - Drop Item</li><li>Right Trigger - Attack / Throw</li><li>Left and Right D-Pad - Scroll weapons (Controller)</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Credits: <br/></p>\n<p>David Reynolds - Modeling, Layout &amp; Texture <br/></p>\n<p>Nick Saucedo - Asset Artist <br/></p>\n<p>Carsen Kelliher - 3D and Sprite Artist <br/></p>\n<p>Taylor Reynolds - Design and Presentation <br/></p>\n<p>Justine Stewart - UI Development <br/></p>\n<p>Chris Purse - Audio <br/></p>\n<p>Andrew Thompson - Tech Art and Programming <br/></p>\n<p>Sam Warner - AI and Programming <br/></p>\n<p>Nick Cadieux - Programming <br/></p>\n<p>Taylor Cunningham - Programming <br/></p>\n<p>AJ Jones - Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:37:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8f/c8f6259b0cb2b9cb750661522432e2c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Overtech Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
