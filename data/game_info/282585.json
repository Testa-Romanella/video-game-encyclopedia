There's maybe something I can do to circumvent this, but I did not have the time right now to look into this. Until then, as a workaround if you want, the message is printed in the browser Javascript console ( on Chrome:\u00a0Ctrl+Shift+J, Firefox:\u00a0Ctrl-Shift-K), this one is copy-able.</p>\n<p>The resolution on mobile is not supported by default, but you can force the desktop site in the option of your mobile browser to view it correctly. The resolution was build with 1024x768 in mind, but should somewhat work with others.</p>\n<p>If you have suggestion and/or bug, you can comment bellow (only with an account (free)). Or tell me in the chat if I'm there :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f41/f412996793318ac83ef0afecb55db573.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["krahs4"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
