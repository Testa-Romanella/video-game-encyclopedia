You're trapped with one such reactor and your only hope of escaping is to fill up the reactor with water or perish in the explosion. You're a semi - unstable character who needs to navigate to the lever using boxes and chains. Pulling on the lever releases the water , which in turn defuses the reactor . Hence moving on to the next level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T14:27:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/778/77877ab32c823ff569b8a84c4a4ae785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["berry410"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
