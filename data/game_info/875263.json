Inspired by 2d sand falling games like \"the powder toy\" or \"sandspiel\".</p>\n<p>Currently this is the first beta of the game, with no UI, sound, settings, nothing. It's just the bare minimum of what the game could be. I was able to finish this a month ago but due to school wasn't able to upload.</p>\n<p>It would be extremely helpful if you can leave some feedback on the game. Anything will do whether its glitches you found, gameplay improvement, or elements you would like!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>ESC to leave game</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>QE to strafe up and down (not really needed but it's there anyway :P)</p>\n<p>Shift to speed up movement</p>\n<p>Mouse to rotate</p>\n<p>Right Click to place elements</p>\n<p>Left Click to delete elements</p>\n<p><strong>Choose element using keys 0-9</strong></p>\n<p>1 - sand</p>\n<p>2 - water</p>\n<p>3 - rock</p>\n<p>4 - electricity</p>\n<p>5 - wire</p>\n<p>6 - LED</p>\n<p>7 - smoke</p>\n<p>8 - fire</p>\n<p>9 - wood</p>\n<p>10 - gunpowder</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T11:21:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/309/309a79f78330543f31bcc56db4de756c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TealEgg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
