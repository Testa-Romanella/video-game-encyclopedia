Together with two other fantastic Game Designers and an amaizing team of artists, we overcame the challenge of creating a game in 48 hours and I must say that the result was very satisfying! </p>\n<p>Play as Chip, a cute and hard-working transistor, busy repairing the defences of his beloved motherboard, under attack from a group of evil viruses! Chip isn't alone in this task: the installed antivirus will produce powerful THREADs, which will attack the viruses and give you time to repair the defence towers, but make sure the THREAD production stations are always running! You cannot win this battle on your own!</p>\n<p>COMMANDS:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D: Movement.</p>\n<p>SPACE BAR: Hold to repair a tower or a station.</p>\n<p>TAB: Overlook of the motherboard.</p>\n<p>ESC: Pause menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T12:16:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/987/9872cc0d8157cbdc95abb9d0104c459d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matteo Moriani", "Andremarr", "FraDetto"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
