The chilling soundtracks convey a certain mood as you loop through the level and the colors. No color is visible longer than a single frame, so there's only ever 2 visible colors. The palette changes depending on your action. If you are sensible to flashing lights, you can play it in an\u00a0accessability mode and all will stay black and white. Enjoy and thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T13:22:11", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pumpkin2d"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
