Seems pretty easy, huh? Well, it's not.</p>\r\nThe problem? \r\n<p>The \"Super Screenbreaker 3000\" a.k.a. \"The Yellow Ball of Doom\" tries to break your screen. Constantly and whenever it can.\u00a0</p>\r\nYour job?\r\n<p>Stop it, before it breaks your screen. Simply click the screenbreaker before it reaches the 4th wall. It hums louder (in joy) and turns red when it comes close to your screen. Click it to turn it around.</p>\r\nAnd the poor colored blocks?\r\n<p>The screenbreaker loves glass, so it also loves to break glass bricks. Sacrifice the bricks to the mighty gods of screenbreaking - maybe it softens up the screenbreaker to leave your screen alone. Maybe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f16b98dcc3d9effcf0001e24e9ee78a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Wolfs Gamelab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
