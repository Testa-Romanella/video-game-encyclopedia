It was an adventure, having to learn enough python to make it work, put a game together, and also research some of these key figures... but I did it! With some help from my friend Andrew Flanagan we managed to get submitted with literal minutes to spare in the contest deadline. After a couple years of not being hosted anywhere when the context website went down, it's now home on Itch.io!<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you have fun. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a3/5a3430600f79724ad5f15ea4d0ac08b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Spleen Machine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
