Balls appear only in one color, you've got two paddles. After each 30 seconds next wall of blocks will appear, so you must be quick!<br/></li><li><strong>Colorful Blitz</strong> - A challenging mode where the blocks, balls and paddles needs to match a color. After hitting box the ball changes color. To bounce it you need to change the color of paddle to match it. You will have to be switching between them all the time! <br/></li><li><strong>Shield Bolt</strong> - Get the elastic shield attached to your both paddles. In this mode you will have to be more wary how your paddle looks like and where in space is it placed.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4e/d4e5edb52a180c6d32bcc73d069c6eec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team NeonPong"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team NeonPong"], "esrb_rating": null}
