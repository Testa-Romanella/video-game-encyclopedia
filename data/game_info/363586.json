{"id": 363586, "slug": "macedonia-alpha", "name": "Macedonia (alpha)", "name_original": "Macedonia (alpha)", "description": "<p>Macedonia is a game about fruit. You solve short but sometimes difficult puzzles by going up and down elevators, jumping on trampolines, and (most importantly) collecting fruit that does what <em>you</em> tell it to do.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Use A and D to move you character left and right, and W, S to interact with some objects. Using the mouse, you can assign effects to the fruit present on the level; this will become much clearer when you play the game!</p>\n<p><strong>What's in the game at the moment</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is now in <strong>alpha </strong>state, so expect all the following numbers to grow (especially the number of levels!)</p>\n<ul><li>21 unique, fine-tuned puzzles</li><li>18 fruits and 8\u00a0effects</li><li>12 super good jazz tracks</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Technical things and some tips</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game has autosave at the end of\u00a0each level and after you quit.</p>\n<p>Press ESC to open the pause menu like in any other game. From here, you can choose to skip a level if you think it's too hard, however it won't be counted as completed (you can see the difference in the level select screen).</p>\n<p>I have yet to implement resolutions other than 1920x1080, but you should still be able to play; if you do have a display with this resolution, please enable fullscreen in the settings!</p>\n<p>Please reach out to me if you have any issues, questions or suggestions. The game is not finished, so all constructive feedback, positive or not, is appreciated. Thank you for trying Macedonia!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T08:18:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/949/949983bfd89f665566f26a664a23bfec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fecs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
