Think your way out of sticky situations by remembering how both speed and direction (relative to the portals), are conserved when being teleported. Once you understand the basics, levels that look impossible at first can be solved with a bit of brainpower. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>By\u00a0<strong>Gwilym Hughes</strong> and <strong>Michael Baxendale</strong></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Use your cursor to aim, then click\u00a0to fire a portal from your player's head.
