{"id": 211328, "slug": "bit-shift-paradisesketch", "name": "Bit Shift Paradise(Sketch)", "name_original": "Bit Shift Paradise(Sketch)", "description": "<p>\"BIT SHIFT PARADISE\" is an Arcade-Style Action Puzzle  game in which the player\u00a0 must navigate a single byte through a series of program routines running inside of a computer system in order to escape without being destroyed. <br/></p>\n<p> To complete each level, the player must take the byte from the start point to the end point within the specified time and total number of deaths.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Different level types include--</p>\n<ul><li>Speed levels: These levels don't have death limits; The goal here is simply to make it to the finish like as fast as possible.</li><li>Puzzle Levels: These levels require solving a puzzle in order to open the path that leads to the finish. Both a time limit and a stock limit are present in this mode</li><li>Technical Levels: These levels feature difficult hazard designs which need to be approached with caution and a steady hand. These levels have long time limits but tight stock limits.</li></ul>\n<p>For an additional challenge there are 3 speed trophies for each level and a \"No Deaths\" star for completing the level without dying.</p>\n\n\n<p>The idea is an attempt to evolve\u00a0 the mechanics found in games like\u00a0 \"Irritating Stick\" and \"The Irritating Maze\" for the NeoGeo and PSX. I had always thought these were really interesting games that were hidden behind a severely under designed, under developed, and input limited facade.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>NEW!</p>\n<p>This project has been canned in favor of better ideas, however; I've decided to upload the very very early prototype engine that was going to be used to develop the game</p>\n<p>NOTE:\u00a0 This is by no means a complete game, it features a title screen, one full level, and one half of a level. This is pretty much a sketchpad I was using to explore the game idea and shouldn't be approached expecting completed gameplay or even complete systems. Alot of things aren't very reactive, are buggy, or just plain don't work; However, this is enough here to play through a complete level to get a feel for what the game might have felt like.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls <br/></p>\n<p>-WASD: Move</p>\n<p>-Left Click: Speed up</p>\n<p>-Right Click: Slow down</p>\n<p>-Enter: Menu Select and Respawn</p>\n<p>-Tab Pause Menu(Press enter while paused to return to the main menu)<br/></p>\n<p>During development I was using a PS4 controller to test with so if you have your own it should work here too--</p>\n<p>-Left Stick: Move</p>\n<p>-Right Trigger: Speed up</p>\n<p>-Left Trigger Slow Down</p>\n<p>-Square Button: Confirm</p>\n<p>-Options Button: Pause(Press Square while paused to return to the main menu)<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea5/ea5602d5b135a75501c5355ba911e820.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tofu Shop"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
