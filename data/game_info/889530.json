This cultural encounter always fascinated me, and there are other example of it in the early 20th century, for instance Schoenberg/Gershwin or Schoenberg/Cage.</p>\n<p>The other theme was an article I started to write on Medium but never finished, reflecting on the role of artists in relation to the time they're living: must art reflect the current (bad) situation to spread awareness or should it provide just pure entertainment or imagination detached from reality? I still don't have an answer to this question.</p>\n<p>The game is still a visual novel (hint: press right to continue) similar to my previous game, and I've implemented the things I've learnt from that experience, there's a hint of an \"examine\" feature that I'd like to develop more in the future.<br/></p><p>For the graphics I've used images generated by Stable Diffusion AI, ported to Bitsy thanks to the Pixsy hack https://ruin.itch.io/pixsy.
