{"id": 456989, "slug": "cave-of-dizziness", "name": "Cave of Dizziness", "name_original": "Cave of Dizziness", "description": "<p>Hi, welcome, and thanks for your interest in our GWJ #22 submission, Cave of Dizziness !</p>\n<p>It is a turn-based puzzle game/dungeon crawler, in which you have reach the third floor of the Cave ; the tiles next to you revolve, \u00a0around you everytime you move though, can be as helpful as dangerous.</p><p>The theme of the GWJ #22 was \"Revolution\" ; you guessed it, we used to fact the tiles revolve around the player to match the theme.</p><p>The game contains no commands list, so to all of you who are kinda lost in the game, here it is :</p><p>The character can move by clicking on the adjacent tile. Everytime you move or perform any action, the tiles around you rotate. You have two buttons at the bottom of the screen ; one allows you to change the rotation direction, the other one changes the radius of the turning tiles. Finally, the big picture on the left indicates which the current radius and rotation direction.</p>\n<p>Okay, so, unfortunately, we were too greedy and didnt manage to finish the game ; it's playable, but, there is no menu, and, uh, you cant either win or die. You can go through the cave, but that's all, no reward on the otherside ; on the other hand, you can lose health, but you wont die, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, I guess.</p>\n<p>This is our absolute first experience with Godot, we never turned it on before this jam. We actually joined this jam to learn it ; so we lost a lot of time. I hope you can still have a little good time here playing our game. Even if we didnt finish, we all would like to know your opinion about what works :) Have a nice day, and well played to all of you jammers !</p>\n\n<p>Game Designer : Eric Lamaison</p>\n<p>Developer : Enora Gicquel</p>\n<p>Graphic Artist : Joris Magras</p>\n<p>Composer : Eric Lamaison</p>\n<p>* The game has been reuploaded to correct a gamebreaking bug, the game crashed when a gobelin hit the player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T02:37:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eae2aa193ee8b12a35d8c2aa2d3162d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kikopu", "Jorismag", "Kahmeset"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
