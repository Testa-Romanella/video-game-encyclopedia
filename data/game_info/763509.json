You can't apply any spin to the ball, or attempt to curve shots around trees. You can't even see where the ball goes after you hit it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can pick a club. You can decide about how hard you want to swing. You can track the ball down to hit it again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTry to complete a course! Each hole is technically able to be completed! You will hit the ball in the general direction of where you're facing when you select your club/power. You have to stand on top of the ball to hit it, not adjacent to it. You can interact with the flag on the green of a hole, and it'll give the option to save (as long as you aren't standing on top of the ball).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T04:25:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/864/864efd06f91078aac1789357b11a1475.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cannibal Interactive", "CannibalInteractive"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Cannibal Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
