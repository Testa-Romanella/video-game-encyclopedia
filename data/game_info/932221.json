It's a 3d platformer and racing game crossover, inspired by 90s collectathons. You play as a toy car with various abilities like jumping, gliding, and even a grappling hook. There are various vehicles that you can purchase with coins in the toy garage. Coins are collected in one of the many rooms inside the fully explorable house. Every room has a different theme with various race tracks, objectives and collectibles.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Use your jump ability to complete various objectives or extend your wings to get off the track and explore the different rooms. There's even a grappling hook to get around in style!</p>\n\n\n<p>For a small car, everyday objects can be a great challenge. AR glasses can give a new view on a room and unravel various new obstacles and objectives. And you should definitely watch out for the roomba..</p>\n\n\n<p>As a solo developer I'm reliant on your feedback, so I'm very open about the development. I share regular updates about new things that I'm working on. So if you are interested in following the progress you can follow me on Twitter, join the Discord or read my devlog and play the alpha version on Patreon. (This demo is currently the newest version available)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T15:32:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1f/c1fcc3e034491e54a57a5d2735a47538.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PanicTheFirst"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
