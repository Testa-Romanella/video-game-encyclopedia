It is not to be supposed to be fun but to tell two different tales of misery:\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the one hand the misconception that only games with long enough playtime are worth playing and worth spending money on.</p>\n<p>On the other hand the tale of the dehumanizing bureaucratic procedures people have to go through in many western countries, if they weren't lucky enough to be born there. The game is playing in a fictive country and the process the player will come across is not an accurate depiction but just a short satirical cross section.</p>\n<p>Help Aizhan to get her work permit by collecting all the necessary documents. Move her with A / D on the keyboard, use E to interact with signs or to enter doors and use I to open your inventory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game comes with a tiny booklet in form a PDF.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce79d78e485fd0b567796b417d25fc16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pidibidi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
