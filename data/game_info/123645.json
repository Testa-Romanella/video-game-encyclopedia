My team consisted of four programmers, two artists, and a musician (design was a team effort). I was one of the programmers and headed the usage of the happyfuntimes library for Unity3D which enables our game to be played with tons of players (anyone with a smartphone or other browser capable devices). It has been tested with around 20 players but it can basically go as high as your computer can handle!</p>Controls<p>Press [SPACEBAR] on the game computer to advance through splash screens and start new games.</p><p>On the phones you steer your character by pressing and holding around the reticle in the middle of the screen.
