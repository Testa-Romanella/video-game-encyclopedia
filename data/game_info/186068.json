I have added better sprites, structures, and some different worlds. The new areas I added where Hell and the Moon. they both have cool blocks that you can use to build stuff, so they are good things to find. but be careful. if you try to find them in the wrong area it will result in immediate death.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Controls</p>\n<p>W key = jump</p>\n<p>A key = move left </p>\n<p>D key = move right</p>\n<p>Shift + A/D = sprint</p>\n<p>Left click = dig / destroy</p>\n<p>Right click = pick up</p>\n<p>Right click Release = place</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have questions about our game email me at . . .</p>\n<p>flamealex33@gmail.com = Alex Sohl (me)</p><p>The website can be found at . . .</p>\n<p>https://flamealex33.wixsite.com/worldexplorer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9b95d51e6e73499f15994bc08af9c35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flame Alex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
