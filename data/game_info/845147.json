The game is made for our house made Light Gun Arcade machine. Eight critters are hiding behind a wall, cheekily only peeking out to laugh at you eventually. Compare the the vertical pairs and check, if the critter from above looks different from the one below. If so, shoot it. Be quick, but take care, missing a shot, destroying a wall or shooting the wrong critter adds penalty seconds to your score time. Can you find the right critter 10 times and reach a score below 60 seconds?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Team Name</strong><br/>nDreamTeam<br/>Megan Chell - Animator<br/>Clemens Scharfen - Programmer<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Instructions<br/></strong>This game is made for a Light Gun Arcade machine.
