These include favorites like the wave, the twist, the bro-shake, air guitar, death breath, pizza tongues, and kitten tongues. <br/><br/>You can choose from 22 selectable characters, with no limitations on the match ups!<br/><br/>In addition to individual scores, you will get scored on compatibility - ranging from -100% to +100%.
