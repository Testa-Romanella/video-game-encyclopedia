Alternatively, drawing a circle on one's palm with the index finger of the opposite hand is also recognized as a greeting.</p>\n<p>The Ne'er-do-well's guild was founded on the tenent that we are the waves carrying the sands and dusts around the world. Move about, spread the word. Objects need to be moved to find their places as humans do.\u00a0To that end, members exchange a curio or bauble from one's pocket when greeting a fellow guildmember. In this way, we see that the objects that need to move around the world find their way.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Magna effectus\u00a0</strong></em><strong><em>parva motus<br/></em></strong>Great effects through small movements</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83d/83d5279df5ccfeb21b041fc8a162d7fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Imaginary Thomas"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
