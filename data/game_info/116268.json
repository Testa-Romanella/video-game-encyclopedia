The Theme of the competition was \"Cute &amp; Gross\". Somehow, my team one the competition. A year later during some holiday down time from work I decided to revisit the project, recoding the engine from scratch and including new mechanics like Powerups, switching between beads, and unlocking new starting beads. Please Enjoy.</p><p><strong>Articles about this game:<br/></strong>https://www.freegameplanet.com/the-final-bead-full...<br/>http://games.softpedia.com/get/Freeware-Games/The-...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7fa58a91ce4fc69b991956be0b5b0b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Eye of Bri"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
