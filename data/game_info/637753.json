That is why you can only play the first puzzle and not really get into what I planned to be lost tech. I enjoyed making this game as it is very different to games I normally create. I may continue after the jam. It got very short, because of that artsy focus.</p>\n<p>Press ESC to free/lock your cursor.</p>\n<p>Press LMB to pick up objects or press buttons.</p>\n<p>Press RMB to put picked up objects back.</p>\n<p>Walk upstairs to leave the game.</p>\n<p>You have finished the game, when the doors open.</p>\n\n<p>If you can't read the instructions, I put them online (spoiler):\u00a0https://pastebin.com/AbgKv9Mh</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:14:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a16/a1686a844452a2ae8cccde4c7666153b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Johannes Witt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
