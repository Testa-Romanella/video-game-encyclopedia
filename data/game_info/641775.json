You cannot kill anyone in the game. It's more about exploration and fun. We pick up things and carry them to their places. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDue to the fact that things have different shapes and sizes, you will have to puzzle over how to deliver this or that thing to the place on time. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDifferent things fall out of the window of the house, you need to pick them up and carry them to the castle, placing them in places marked in green. If you do not have time to quickly bring the thing to the place, it will disappear and you will have to carry it again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor each thing delivered, you receive a reward.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs soon as all the things are placed, you will win the game and get speed points on the leaderboard.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can control the player on the keyboard buttons and pick up, throw items on the left mouse button.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T03:32:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bd/3bdb9b51e424114982de23113942cac7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Porter in the Castle"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Porter in the Castle"], "esrb_rating": null}
