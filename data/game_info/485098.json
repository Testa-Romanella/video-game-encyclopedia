Enjoy the Demo!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Higher Critters Twitter:</strong> @highercritters<h3>Higher Critters is a western-styled multiplayer (1vs4) game.</h3>4 human volunteers are sent to the territory of orcs though teleport stations. Their goal is to rescue the pets and prevent them from being transformed into baby orcs. An adult orc is guarding the territory to ensure the transforming process and keep human volunteers away from baby orcs. <br/> <br/><br/><h3>Gameplay - Human</h3>As a human, your primary objective is to rescue baby orcs. To accomplish this, 4 humans need to do the followings:<br/><br/>1. Find baby orcs.<br/>2. Remove the transform cube on the baby orcs.<br/>3. Lead 5 baby orcs to the teleport stations and send them away.<br/>4. Retreat at the teleport stations.<br/>As you attempt to rescue each baby orc, an adult orc will attempt to find you, down you, and kill you. While playing, you can\u2019t fight back, but can run away, dodge attacks, or use items to hide and evade.<br/>As you attempt to remove the transform cube on the baby orcs, QTEs may be triggered randomly. You need to press the SPACE BAR once the front face of the QTE cube has at least 3 blocks in the same color.<br/><br/><h3>Gameplay \u2013 Orc</h3>As an orc, your primary objective is to kill all the humans in the match. To accomplish this, you need to do the followings:<br/><br/>1. Find and track the humans.<br/>2. Attack the humans before they rescue all the baby orcs.<br/>3. Hang the humans after you caught them.<br/>While you are tracking humans, they will be taking time to remove the transform cube on the baby orcs. You must do your best to kill all the humans before they rescue 5 baby orcs. Your greatest advantages against humans are your speed and active ability.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T22:03:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b729fc76cad6b852f992bbc97bb261d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 382, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BLUE TORCH SOFTWARE"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BLUE TORCH SOFTWARE"], "esrb_rating": null}
