So I Went With The Idea Of Creating A Game That Player Cannot Control Where They Shoot. And Let Me Tell You Game Became So Hard.

(This Mode Is Bugged Because Of The Bullets)</li><li>Cursor Position Mode : In This Players Can Change The Attack Position's Position With Their Cursor However The Player Loses The Ability Of Controlling Themselves.</li><li>Auto Aim Mode : Attack Position Locates Itself On A Random Enemy.</li></ul>\n<p>During The Game Crates Randomly Spawn Around The Player That Changes The Game's Mode Or The Player's Weapon Or They Heal Up The Player Or Kill All Enemies.</p>\n<p>Some Enemies Have Guns.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys For Movement</li><li>Left Mouse Click For Shooting</li><li>If You Are Inside The Cursor Mode Your Mouse Will Change Attack Position</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Both Enemy And Player Bullets\u00a0 Stop When Reached Attack Position.</li><li>Game Loading Is Slow (I Hope It's Because Of My Internet Hopefully It Should Be Ok For You Guys)</li><li>No Audio Feedback?
