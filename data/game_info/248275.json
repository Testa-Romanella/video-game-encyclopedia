{"id": 248275, "slug": "into-the-aether-demo", "name": "Into the Aether (Demo)", "name_original": "Into the Aether (Demo)", "description": "<p>Into the Aether is an RPG that combines the colorful nature of Nintendo games with the complexity and depth of the JRPG genre. The game spans across two worlds: the Earth and the Aether, a world bound by no logic or form. Complimented by it's completely unique art style and soundtrack, ITA sets itself apart from others with it's fast paced and engaging turn based combat.<br/></p>\n<p>You play as a high school girl who is moving to the quaint town of Starry Hill, where many long distance friends are waiting to meet you.<br/>All seems well, until an unavoidable tragedy strikes the earth by storm. Only you and your group of quirky and colorful companions have the courage to embark on a cross-dimensional journey to save the world from the dangers of the Aether.</p>\r\nAn RPG for Everybody\r\n<p>Into the Aether was created by Jacob Melendez and Paul Riggio out of the desire to bring back the feel of Nintendo RPGs that really doesn't seem to be there anymore with newer games. This game has been our passion project for the last couple of years, and we're really excited to finally reveal it!</p>\n<p>We've designed the game so that it appeals to not only the hardcore RPG fan, but also the casual. RPGs today (with a few notable exceptions), don't try to make the experience less grindy or tedious. We're trying to change that. While it doesn't stray too far from the typical RPG formula, Into the Aether will be a relatively grind-less experience on a normal playthrough. You won't need to go back and get stronger unless you want to. There will be hidden bosses and other hidden content for people who want a tougher experience and people who do enjoy the grind. This a game for all types of people to enjoy!</p>\n<strong>Features</strong>\n<ul><li>\u00a0A\u00a0total of 2+ hours of gameplay!
