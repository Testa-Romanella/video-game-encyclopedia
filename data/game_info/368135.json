Start your digital life in this multiplayer RPG, a game that implements the fun aspects of a social, survival, or tycoon game. Play with friends, work your way to the top, and get rich! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCivil is designed to fit all different play-styles. If you are a relaxed player who just enjoys hanging out with friends, trading items, or decorating your house, you can do that at ease. Get in the game, add friends, and live life! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRelaxed players are cool, a social environment is awesome too, but what if you're a hardcore gamer who likes to grind to the top? There's a place for you in the world too. Grinding can be done in 2 different ways! You can join the side of good or the side of evil. Evil players get more freedom, obviously, however their way of life is a lot more difficult and competitive. If you're in it for the money, as most players are, join the side of good! Get your character a career and work your way to the top of the leaderboard. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOr are you just evil? Maybe you don't want to play by the rules. Maybe you want to glitch the game or build a six-million foot tall tower made entirely out of living room furniture; well, you can! There's so much freedom in Civil! Let's say you want to buy a car and destroy things, or kill innocent players. Now you are on the side of evil. You no longer can accept \"good guy\" jobs, so you have to find a job of your own! Find freelance jobs from players or NPCs, rob banks, assassinate your enemies, and more! But watch out: If you get yourself killed it's all over! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCivil is a game with rules, but is still controlled by the players. If you have enough money, start your own organization. Use Civil's trading system to pay other players to do things for you, exchange items, sell your stuff, or more. With enough in-game money, anything is possible! Level up in the world and become good at what you love most! Sports, cooking, art, music; these are just some of Civil's many player skills. Civil: The Game. This immersive MMORPG is perfect for players of all kinds.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T02:22:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93eda494475f533f0a356422a723609c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Civilized Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Civilized Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
