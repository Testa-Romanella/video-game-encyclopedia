The students\u00a0were tasked with setting up and managing a workflow and production pipeline within their team, and students\u00a0were asked to volunteer for preferred development roles before the project started.\u00a0<br/>The projects were created in Unity, and the usage of online assets were permitted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story and project background<br/></strong>Four scavengers go searching for valuables in a post-futuristic society.
