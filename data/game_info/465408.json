Just watch out for the ads the malware likes to post on your home screen... and everywhere else on you PC.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Use your mouse to click on icons and buttons and use your keyboard to type... just like a real OS.</p>\r\nArt and Music:\r\n<p>Art and Music was created over a 48 hour period during the GMTK 2020 Jam. Although some icons where taken from public domain or CC appropriate sources and remixed.</p>\r\nContext:\r\n<p>This game was made during the GMTK 2020 Jam by five people; two programmers (also doing art), and three people helping with the UI. We all have less than six months worth of unity experience, some none at all, but we still made it work...\u00a0 sort of. This is our first game jam so if the game is bad, well at least you know why.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Christopher Nisan - Lead Programmer and Secondary Artist/UI Designer</p>\n<p>Daniel\u00a0Banks - Lead Artist/UI Designer and Secondary Programmer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luke Mackenzie - Original Idea and Ad Design</p>\n<p>Sebastian [RETRACTED] - Ad Design</p>\n<p>Dylan Bish - Ad Design\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T08:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/289/28993ed7eb0d8315d5989ac5fabbd9e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpsLink"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
