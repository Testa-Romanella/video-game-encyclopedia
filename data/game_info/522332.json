(daniel-morgan)", "description": "<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>This project was made for the Trijam 96, the 3 hour game jam. The idea is that you travel between post-creation scenes placing water to feed bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0It is a puzzle/simulation game that uses a cellular automata.\u00a0It created 3 levels (of an intended 5) before I ran out of time. The game is incredibly simplistic and the first 2 levels require nothing else other than just water.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creation</strong></p>\n<p>For its creation, I\u00a0used a prebuilt cellular automata script I made a few years ago.\u00a0\u00a0If you look in through the source code you will find it titled \"particles-main.js\". I made several changes to it to accommodate for Pour being more of a game than a simulation, and also because several parts simply just didn't work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other than that it is pure out of the box browser JavaScript. I considered using p5.js but decided against it in favor of my system.</p>\n<p>Thanks For Playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T04:57:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/651/651e037864f5a1e42b6a74049c8726f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["daniel-morgan"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
