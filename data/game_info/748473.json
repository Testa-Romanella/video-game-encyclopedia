She has... moved on, I guess... and needs to find herself a job. You&#39;ll need to guide her to a fresh new destiny, and watch her get fucked by weird things thousands of times in the process. Fun! The game plays similarly to Soo Cubus in that you need to build up your stats and are fighting a time limit, though there&#39;s more complexity and strategy involved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-01T07:46:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e8197e783f33c4fb445b5ef5121e48f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
