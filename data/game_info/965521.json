{"id": 965521, "slug": "holy-stick", "name": "Holy Stick!", "name_original": "Holy Stick!", "description": "Holy Stick! is a party game, and action shooter for up to 8 players where you use powerful weapons to shred the limbs of your enemies! There are different weapons, maps, customisation options and a Craziness System. On top of that - no health bars! Brace yourself, limbs will fly!<br/><ul><h3>Dynamic Body Damage</h3> Forget about health bars, in this game you have to take good care of your body! Getting a bullet in the knee might result in losing an entire leg, which will slow you down. Having your hands chopped off will make you unable to use weapons - you'll have to kick your way out of a fight, so that you can heal and quickly get back to action!<h3>Customization</h3> Give your stickman a unique personality, by using a wide selection of costumes and voices. We've got everything - knights, pirates, soldiers, ninjas, Italian chefs, French musicians... Or would you like an American special forces commando, who runs around with a giant donut sledgehammer and shouts \"Bon voyage!\" while pounding his enemies into the ground?<h3>Loads Of Content</h3> It will take a long time, before you experience everything we've packed into Holy Stick! We've got a huge arsenal of firearms and melee weapons to chop up your enemies, a wide variety of gamemodes to choose from, multiple beautiful maps, and a mysterious Craziness System, which changes the game's rules from time to time. You know, lower the gravity a bit, force everyone to jump, turn the entire game upside down or have everybody using shotguns with explosive ammo... just to keep things spicy!<h3>Hand-drawn Artstyle</h3> Do you remember that time at primary school, when you used to draw simple characters and scenes on the back of your notebook? Or the web browser games, featuring stickman characters? Relive those moments again in this nostalgia-driven game!<h3>Hybrid Multiplayer</h3> Play however you want! Would you like to sit back on a couch with a couple of friends and play a casual match? Splitscreen for up to 4 players is the right choice! Do you prefer online multiplayer and don't mind playing with strangers? We got you covered! Or maybe you'd like a hybrid setting, like 4 vs 4 match with two machines, joined into one game over the internet? We can handle that too! The only thing we don't have right now is a single player mode.</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-28T03:28:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/309/309a91f58cbb20c85f65486d71153e79.jpg", "website": "https://linktr.ee/holy.stick", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Always Too Late"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Always Too Late"], "esrb_rating": null}
