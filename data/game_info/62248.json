{"id": 62248, "slug": "coffee-crawl", "name": "Coffee Crawl", "name_original": "Coffee Crawl", "description": "A strange phenomenon has swept across the globe. People began to fall asleep no matter where they are. By the third day only a remaining few who are still awake, surpressing their urge to sleep with, well... coffee. The rest shows no sign of waking up.  <br/><br/>Coffee crawl is a mix of action RPG, survival, and roguelike; that means permanent death. You play as one of the survivor who must find the source of the phenomena and put a stop to it, since you have nothing else to do. There's a slight learning curve in this game. You can learn the basic from the tutorial, but most stuff and interactions need to be discovered by player themselves, by playing and dying.<br/> Features  <ul> <li>Explore randomly-generated levels; from an inconspicuously large basement to a spellbinding library. <br/> </li><li>Simple and fast-paced combat. No aiming skill required. You just have to know when to engage or retreat. <br/> </li><li>Build your character from a pool of 120+ abilities and customise your look. <br/> </li><li>Unlock more stuff as you play. <br/> </li><li>Tons of items. <br/> </li><li>Encounter 100+ different types of enemy. <br/> </li><li>Play by the rules, or go anarchy and do whatever you like. Just don't get caught. <br/> </li><li>Money is scarce so manage you resources, mine for materials, craft items, trade, or just take a loan. <br/> </li><li>Employ the service of various NPCs scattered around the map or beat them for their lunch money. <br/> </li><li>Detailed diplomacy system; make friend or enemy with people you meet along the way. <br/> </li><li>Learn a weird language.  </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa1/aa1522427e402d345f257758b2a37b8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 33}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vectorinox"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vectorinox"], "esrb_rating": null}
