I was trying to make ringtones from my friends, from booklets in the Composer app. At that time, I could not create music because I had no knowledge of music theory. When I saw this jami, it came to my mind to turn this composer app into a game. My work got easier when I saw notes amongst jam resources. I added 7 pieces of music to my game. I hope you will like it.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: After the jam, I will share the source codes of the game and how to add new music on this page.</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds:VIRTUALLY CONDUCTED KONTAKT COMPOSER + SAMPLES</strong></p>\n<p>Fonts:<strong>@GIZMO199 +@SOMEPX\u00a0EFFORTS PRO AND ARK\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>(https://phillipp.itch.io/nokiajamresources)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T09:27:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/394/394554ef01fe4169383ad4de075fd663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Recep EKMEKC\u0130"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
