On a seemingly normal day, everything's gone wrong with the containment facility. That spells trouble... and provides dear Ira with an escape opportunity!\r\n<p>--</p>\n<p>First time using Unity! This game\u00a0was made in 4 weeks for a college project (Game dev class).\u00a0I've worked with Game Maker: Studio\u00a0before and I have to say, Unity's is quite a massive upgrade. I tried emulating the artstyle of the Mario &amp; Luigi RPGs, and I'd say it worked out relatively well!\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's a couple of bugs I know of,\u00a0 and I'll get to fix them sometime; for now however, my attention's going to another project that may or may not show up over here on Itch...
