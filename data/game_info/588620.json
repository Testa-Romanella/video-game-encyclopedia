Play as googly-eyed hand puppets in various arcade competitions. Recreations of games like pong, volleyball, air hockey, lethal league, and a very odd pong clone that I made in high school, Hans Vs. The Russian. This remake has been made with accuracy in mind, though not necessarily quality. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:08:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/846c3b8872c59e1c4c1af8bf2d4eb57b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TechDragoon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
