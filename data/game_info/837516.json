Several moves are all developing, and then they try to capture neighboring countries.<br/>The economic model is very simple - the entire territory of the country is used for sowing grain. Of the grown crop, part is used again for sowing, part for sale and receiving money. The larger the territory, the bigger the harvest and the richer the country.<br/>The scientific model contains 6 directions. The urban scientific level increases the population density - more people per unit area of the country. Demographic level increases population growth. The agricultural level affects the yield. The cost of grain sold is affected by the financial level. The strength and endurance of soldiers is affected by the military level. The effectiveness of scientists who study all this is influenced by the scientific level.<br/>At the beginning, the population of the country consists only of peasants who sow the territory with grain. Population growth also goes to the peasants. And scientists and soldiers are already training from peasants (of course for money). The country essentially needs money for several purposes - hiring and maintaining scientists (for the development of science), hiring and maintaining soldiers (for the defense of the country and the seizure of territories), and hiring generals (soldiers are fighting under their leadership).<br/>Generals you can pump to your liking, this is the main feature of the game.<br/>The main factors of victory are a large and strong army, a high military level, and strong pumped generals.<br/>It is possible to achieve this only with the comprehensive development of science, competent tactics and strategy.<br/>Try to start playing on the smallest map for 5 countries.
