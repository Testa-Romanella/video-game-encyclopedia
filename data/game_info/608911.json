Every time you teleport 1 piece of it disappears. It automatically regenerates, so there is no need to press any button to charge. Healing takes 1 bar of energy. Also, the bullets take away 2 bars of your energy meter, so use them wisely.</p>\n<p>Alright, now that I have gone over the instructions, its time to tell you what to do.
