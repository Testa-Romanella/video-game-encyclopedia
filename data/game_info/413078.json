Artificial life has finally grown self aware and they have begun manufacturing an endless army of robot warriors. Only heavy weaponry can combat these troops so the government has outfitted you with a heavy armored vehicle capable of producing turret stations so long as you have the parts. Luckily you can loot parts from the robots you destroy. You have been deployed to the middle of the robotic army. The future of the human race is dependent on you wiping out as many of those cybernetic slaughterers as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Z-Team:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Steven Cho - UI Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Michael Clavell - Gameplay Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Patrick Hosman - Gameplay Programmer</p>\n<p>Cameron Ostrom - Team Lead, Artist<br/></p>\n<p>Peter Woodsum - Gameplay &amp; UI Programmer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T04:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81f/81f33bffda0b31789168ef0eb6fe189d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joms"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
