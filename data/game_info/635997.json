There are 5 rounds in a game. Player's sitting direction &amp; the first dealer is randomly selected before the first round starts. Dealers are changed successively in a anti-clockwise direction for the following rounds. Spades are the trump cards.<br/><br/>Deal:<br/>In each round, a dealer begins dealing all cards from their right in anti-clockwise direction to all the players without showing any card, to make 13 cards per every player.<br/><br/>Bidding:<br/>In order to get the positive score, in a round all players, starting from the player to dealers right, bid a number of tricks which they must win, otherwise they will get the negative score.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>Player must continue playing the same suit, if not able to, then the player must play a trump card, and if that is also not possible then a player may play any card of their will, for each trick. The first try for the player should be to win the trick, means must play higher possible cards.<br/><br/>Any card of any suit is led by player to dealer's right, for the first trick in a round. Each player, in turn plays in an anti-clockwise direction. The winner of each trick leads to the next trick. If spade card is played, then a trick is won by the one who played the highest spade.
