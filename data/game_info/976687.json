Nevertheless, when they can't give up on purification, a makeshift tuner is created by combining a skeletal judgment line and a music-energy stone called a 'purification stone.' Taking care of this unstable invention and starting over again, there is a whole new style of performance that is more confusing, complex, bumpy, unpredictable, but sometimes colorful, dynamic, brilliant.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Characteristics of the game</strong><br/><br/>1. There is a judgment line that freely crosses straight lines and circles, and it is a unique system that remotely hits notes by controlling two 'purification stones' placed on it with eight key inputs. The nine types of notes, each in a different way to destroy, are designed to reflect the characteristics of the game, and the oddly woven patterns, combining all these elements, give you a shock you've never felt before. Enjoy 27 kinds of song pattern, which range from boringly easy to very challenging and difficult.<br/><br/>2. With the permission of Noxy Games Inc. and composers, nine great pieces from Lanota were brought.<br/>List of songs:<br/>Alice Schach and the Magic Orchestra - Teardrop del Rey<br/>FOIV - Rebind<br/>HyuN - Fighter<br/>Notorious(Nota &amp; TRIAL) - GIFT<br/>Powerless - Dragon's Sky<br/>brz1128 - Alexandrite<br/>Sound Souler - 414 PER SPEED<br/>Kry.exe - Broken Altair<br/>Raimukun - Nyarlathotep's Dreamland<br/><br/>3. Pictures that exclude characters and place more importance on color than shape fill the screen. Object design and illustration applied for each piece of music are somewhat clumsy and clunky, but on the other hand, they form a sensuous and profound atmosphere.<br/><br/><br/>2023.03 ~ 2024.02<br/>Devoting my senior year in high school, joversound", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T04:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c0/8c076e09ed2ce80607465d6e74fa5342.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joversound"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["joversound"], "esrb_rating": null}
