As the hand moves around the clock, the play area also moves further from the center of the clock. This causes you to cover more ground more quickly, so obstacles gradually come at you faster and faster.</p>\n<p>I wish <br/>I had more time to polish this up, and create some more interesting balance in the obstacles and game play. I hoped to add check points and additional power ups to extend the game play, but for now it only has a few minutes of gameplay.</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br/>- Lenny</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b4/4b4a158cc58a00a446ce2ebed2551938.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lsirivong"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
