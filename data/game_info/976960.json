Then he gave you a chance to steal his gold, but there were many monsters hovering at every level you faced. Steal the gold, then kill the monsters that are trying to take their leaders gold. Then escape through a series of levels of adventure and different kinds of monsters to enjoy killing.<br/><br/><strong>Speedrun</strong><br/>You can speedrun with two types of units: a timer or a stopwatch. When you create a game, you can customize the time or the values of the time for speedrunning.<br/><br/><strong>Maze</strong><br/><br/>I made a maze that has only 90% chance of escaping, but there is a short cut I designed for you to find and escape.<br/><br/><strong>Improved Inventory Tab</strong><br/><br/>You're able to put your items in the inventory. Examples: your ammos; food; water; skeletons; pots; and also the gold nugget.  <br/><br/><strong>Statistics</strong><br/>Your movements are recorded on the statistics tab. When you walk, run, kill enemies, and many more, this is all recorded in statistics.<br/><br/><strong>The Gold</strong><br/><br/>The Gold that you will steal but there are some monsters that will chase you and will take the gold back to them.<br/><br/><strong>One of the Monsters</strong><br/><br/>Here is one of the monsters that you will see in the game. This monster is the most common among them all. I prepared almost 100 monsters of seven different types.
