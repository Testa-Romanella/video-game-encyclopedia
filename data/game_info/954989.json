Beset on all sides, they lived a subsistence lifestyle far below the surface. To protect them,\u00a0the Goddess of Safety and Comfort,\u00a0Thrumalda, closed off the Dwarven lands of\u00a0Fjellheim from the outside world and warded all of the exits.</p>\n<p>Since then, the Dwarven people have thrived. Majestic cities built in colossal caves, lit by bioluminescent fungi are a site to see. However, not everyone is happy.</p>\n<p>You are an acolyte of the Haelvanna, the Goddess of Exploration and Freedom. She has tasked you with undoing Thrumalda's wards and opening a path to the outside world.</p>\n<p>What follows is up to you...</p>\n\n<p>Sanctuary's Grasp is a weird little dungeon crawler made by one person\u00a0in a week for Dungeon Crawler Jam 2023. Balance is off, it's content light, and\u00a0it could use any playtesting, but that's game jams for you! It should take you around 15 minutes to complete. I approached the theme of duality by having two goddesses with conflicting purposes\u2014prioritizing safety vs. prioritizing adventure\u2014and having the player have to come down on one side or the other.</p>\n<p>Playing the tutorial is highly recommended, as the battle system might be confusing otherwise.</p>\n<p>Visually, Sanctuary's Grasp\u00a0was inspired by a mix of Wizardry Dimguil for the game world\u00a0and the UI of\u00a0those charmingly ugly gridders from the 90s.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls are rebindable in the game.
