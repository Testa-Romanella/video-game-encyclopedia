The game's puzzles are tile-based with the objective being to make every tile green. There's a variety of different tiles each affects other tiles in a different way.</p>\n\n<p>This demo contains 28 different puzzles following 2 different paths through the demo(hard and easy), the goal of this demo is to get a feel for how people respond to the puzzles as they will be the main mechanic throughout\u00a0the final game. This demo is FREE so there's no reason not to try it, it shouldn't take longer than an hour to complete.</p>\n<p>In-game there is a survey. As this is essentially a free game, all I ask in return is that you complete this survey.</p>\n<p>Thank you, and I hope you enjoy my demo!!!!</p>\n<p>- The full release is planned for Q4 this year(September-December)</p>\n<p>- For updates on the games development, be sure to check out\u00a0https://www.reddit.com/r/KeysToTheFutureGame/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T07:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/467/467122ebb11233632cf47438157aa5a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zach"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
