Here's an explanation of the game rules, if you keep it between us</em>: You\u2019re on the run from the fuzz, and if the blinding police lights reach you then it\u2019s game over. To escape, you gotta run and jump from building to building. If you fall to the ground you'll want to get back up ASAP, cause running into pedestrians will cause you to trip and lose speed! Try dodging them until you reach a platform low enough to jump onto, or try to springboard back up. Oh, and I hear that <em>\"The Man\"</em> has officers stationed on rooftops to block you!</p>\n<p><em>Here\u2019s what the establishment doesn\u2019t want you to know:</em> You can use the up arrow, W key or south gamepad button to jump! Your jump height depends on how quickly you let go of the input.</p>\n<p><em>Now don't go spilling what I'm about to tell you</em>: Parkour vault over police officers or pedestrians to boost yourself! Right before running into \u2018em, you\u2019ll see a purple icon above you. That\u2019s when you hit the right arrow, D key or east gamepad button, but you\u2019ll lose speed if you\u2019re too early or late.</p>\n<p><em>You didn't hear it from me, but peep this info</em>: Hit the jump button right before running into someone and you'll springboard way into the air! It can help you get back up from the ground, and you\u2019ll need to do it to finish later levels. I recommend practicing in the tutorial.</p>\n<p><em>Don't go runnin' your mouth off about this either:</em> You can use the M key to mute the music or the N key to skip to the next song!</p>\n<p><em>The word in the streets is this: </em>You can use the escape key to pause / unpause the game! While paused, you can use the backspace key to return to the main menu.</p>\n<p><em>Keep this under your hat, but my sources say this:</em> You can double tap the R key to restart the level!</p>\n<p><em>Good luck, kid. I was never here, got it?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>NEWGROUNDS VERSION</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made for, and with help from, the community at Newgrounds.
