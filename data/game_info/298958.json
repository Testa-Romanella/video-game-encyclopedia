Anyway, I want them to meet all the characters from the original, like a true fan prequel.</p>\n<p>Roadmap:</p>\n<p>I'm doing this in my free time so don't expect constant updates. But I want to do:</p>\n<p>1) Full movement control of Claw (and Redtail) like in original game - 5% done<br/></p>\n<p>2) Import some original level and play in co-op mode - 0% done<br/></p>\n<p>3) Add my own levels and storyline using existing assets - 0.1% done<br/></p>\n<p>4) Find someone to make similar art to Claw for new characters - 0% done<br/></p>\n<p>5) Polish it!!! - 0% done</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Patkelus<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:05:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0d/c0d45e1e3b99ac1c0f7fc69bd4bb3966.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["patkelus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
