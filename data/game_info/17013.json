{"id": 17013, "slug": "lucius", "name": "Lucius", "name_original": "Lucius", "description": "<p>06.06.1966 - an unusual number of sixes on this date, perhaps, somehow affected the character of one boy, born that day - Lucius. And certainly his character was influenced by the fact that his father is Lucifer himself, who on the sixth day after birth informed the boy that he had prepared many gifts for him. But to get these gifts, the boy needs a little work. Namely - to finish off everyone who lives with the boy in the same house or just inappropriately appeared next to him. This is a lot of people - twenty. Most different, from butlers and gardeners to reporters, priests and police. Papa Lucifer did not make any special demands, he was soft with his son - he did not order any special methods of murder, he agreed to any. But life is unpredictable, and the boy had to often retreat from simple scenarios, acting very ingeniously. On the other hand, he already had some of the unusual gifts - for example, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, the ability to subordinate someone else&#39;s will.</p>", "metacritic": 59, "released": "2012-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-30T05:18:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/679/67900b47263413bd65fc0032ad966e0b.jpg", "website": "http://lucius.shivergames.com", "rating": 3.12, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 125, "owned": 2092, "beaten": 161, "toplay": 31, "dropped": 105, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 58, "ratings_count": 231, "suggestions_count": 339, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 232, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shiver Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shiver Games"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
