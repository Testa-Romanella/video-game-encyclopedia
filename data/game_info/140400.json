The theme was color: so, the way I implemented it was with the player being a painter. By touching buckets of paint you are able to change the color of your overalls, and so changes what kind of blocks can you interact with. I believe the idea could be better explored, but I think I'll leave it alone for some time.</p><p>\u00a0Ok, now the controls:</p><ul><li>Arrows keys to move;</li><li>Z to jump;</li><li>X to run.</li></ul><p>\u00a0Feedback is welcome, of course.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/384dac6f5b39ab1403d87093e602b566.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Delta Key"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
