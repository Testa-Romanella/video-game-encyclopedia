Loneliness and boring submarine life getting to them, can they find anybody to make the upcoming tragedy worth it? Mudraptor aboard, Crawler in the ballast, the possibilities are endless in The Great Sea! (Not really. They're pretty limited, actually.)<br/><br/>Game takes 45m-1h to 100% complete. There are four endings as of Update 1.1.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>FAQ:<br/>Q: but why?<br/>A: short answer: cause i'm bored and i think it's a hilariously outrageous concept to even conceive, let alone put time into making<br/>long answer: waiting on other people for my main writing/game development projects, desire to develop a Ren'py project, really like Barotrauma, and really enjoy unique gijinka/monster girl designs. mix those interests all together with an unhealthy dose of boredom, desire to make something lightheartedly catered towards myself, and a pinch of laziness;\u00a0 you get this horrific game.<br/><br/>Q: game content warnings?<br/>A: there is swearing, graphic/written descriptions of gore, and general despair. there is <strong>NO PERVERTED CONTENT </strong>and there never will be. <br/><br/>Q: \"bad\"?<br/>A: this game was slapped together in 4 days. It has a decent amount of love put into it but it, for sure, is not something I wanted to sink a whole month into with carefully drawn assets and perfected story. ultimately just a small passion project that i may bounce to whenever i'm in the <em>very </em>specific mood.<br/><br/>Q: how lore accurate?<br/>A: i try to keep it relatively lore accurate but things are liquid, im bad at holding the Barotrauma lore in my head, and some HEAVY stretching is required for even the mere concept of \"dating intelligent Barotrauma creatures.\"<br/><br/>Q: update?<br/>A: lol maybe if this gets like 2 downloads ill think about it<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T10:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9c5227fb76562012ed2664e91a86377.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TheShoeBurglar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
