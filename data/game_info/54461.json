The game was developed by H2O Entertainment and published by Nintendo, based on the latter's popular Tetris series. The game was originally released on July 31, 1999, in North America.</p>\n<p>The game is notable for showing scenic fly-bys of famous structures (for examples the Sphinx, the Pantheon, Saint Basil's Cathedral, a Mayan temple, and others) rendered in realtime. This is relatively difficult for the Nintendo 64 hardware to accomplish at the quality that is achieved. The New Tetris also features a multiplayer mode with up to four players and an ethnically themed electronic dance music soundtrack by Neil Voss, who also composed the award-winning music for Tetrisphere.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dd/6dd657093d272e27921513e636843bb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Blue Planet Software", "H2O Entertainment"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
