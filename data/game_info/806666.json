The idea is that you have 15 seconds before you self-destruct, but there is a pool of water somewhere on the level, so you have to get there in time without hitting a spike or cannonball. This is also my first game ever that I have finished and released so it's probably not the best but I hope you still enjoy it! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-21T00:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f98/f9820b2347974259f3b9fc1b861df982.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chase_Exists"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
