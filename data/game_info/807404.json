All of the story paths etc are in and  SHOULD be working.</p>\n<p>If you find any major issues (conversations  that just stop and progress becomes impossible, for example), please do  let me know and I will update to fix them as best as I can. It is  entirely possible some late change has broken something without me  realising, but hopefully not.\r\n  </p>\n<p>As always, I don't ask or intend ever to ask for money for any of these. If you feel compelled, a retweet/tweet about it, spreading the word, or making a donation to a charitable cause would be a better use of the money you would have given for this and I genuinely would prefer that. I would suggest Trans Lifeline, the Trevor Project, SWARM, or similar - or of course, donate to help in Ukraine.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for your time! :)\r\n    </p>\n<p>\r\n    EDIT: .gb ROM for emulators or actual hardware. <br/></p>\n<p>https://mega.nz/file/uVww2LRT#oXVL6Y4tt2tvmSypbaA0UpMC9o-RPe4Rae3tjQ9fMYE<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T10:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/ada52bb54d9a6eaf09880af25f7e2912.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lifeis2d"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
