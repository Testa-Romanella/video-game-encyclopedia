This is a game that replicates that wonderful experience!<br/><br/>Rub the cat's belly up and down, but keep an eye on their face... if they look agitated at all, lift your finger before they pounce! Make sure you don't rub off their belly when they're enjoying themselves, too! It... displeases them.</p><p>For the dog lovers, there is also a puppy mode! There is no game over with the puppy, but it may guilt you into replaying if you stop rubbing their belly!</p><p>FEATURES:</p><p>- Three different animals/difficulty modes<br/>- A hip and happening soundtrack by AIRVOSS<br/>- Both phone and tablet friendly<br/>- Cuteness to the extreme</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47d/47dc08cf02bdab34f71bccdf08915244.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Hulk Handsome"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
