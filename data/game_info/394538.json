You have to click twice!<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, we know about this bug and we tried to fix it for a long time. Unfortunately it's a limitation of the framework we built the game on and we didn't have time to rebuild the framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do i need both files to run the game?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>No, you do not need both files to run Avarice. <br/>The setup is an installer that installs the game and does the work for you.
