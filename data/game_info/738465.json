{"id": 738465, "slug": "fatal-cash", "name": "Fatal Cash", "name_original": "Fatal Cash", "description": "<p>Fatal Cash is a game placed in the old Nokia 3310 world and is about collecting coins and cash without getting hit by spawning lasers. XP plays a big role in the game as it is both your HP and level up system. This game is a submission to the Nokia 3310 annual GameJam and is made in the following restrictions:</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0The game must use only 2 colors (<strong>#c7f0d8</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>#43523d</strong>)</li><li>The base resolution is 84x48 (in this case, upscaled to <strong>840x480</strong>)</li><li>The game uses only 9 controls (<strong>WASD</strong>, or alternatively <strong>arrow keys</strong>, and enter)</li><li>The game uses only sounds Nokia 3310 could play with no overlapping ones</li><li>All art and code assets were made during the jam, and for the music, I used existing Nokia 3310 ringtones</li><li>No subpixel movement is present</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>arrow keys</strong> to move and navigate the menu, and enter to click the button. Occasionally, <strong>coins</strong> and <strong>cash </strong>will spawn that you have to collect to get more <strong>XP.\u00a0</strong>You level up when you reach 200 <strong>XP.</strong> At different levels, you reach different stages that have upgraded spawn rates. These happen:</p>\n<ol><li>When you reach level 1</li><li>When you reach level 5</li><li>When you reach level 10</li></ol>\n<p>The game is over when you get to the level 20. Be careful, as lasers remove <strong>50 XP</strong> when touched, and when you reach <strong>0 XP,\u00a0</strong>you die.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T05:07:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdb1cca05512cbcdaf1d019f884c0cee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["IKDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
