The cartridge contains an alpha version of a technical marvel - a killer game on the bleeding edge of what was possible at the time, known as PROJECT DISARRAY.</p>\n<p>This game was to revolutionise the industry. Instead, it crashed and burned. Its lengthy and notoriously chaotic development aprubtly stopped when its star director (Robert Carson, the illustrious and notorious industry veteran) vanished without a trace in late December, 1993, along with the lead programmer (Terry Gorski, the demoscene legend). <br/></p>\n<p>PROJECT DISARRAY was thought to be lost - until now. What mysteries does this cartridge hold? Is it haunted? Were there any spooky ghosts involved? Time to find out!</p>\n<p><strong>Hints, tips, pointers and miscellania</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Attacking (both punching and shooting) is only possible when standing still (turning is OK though).</li><li>Camera is kinda clunky and not always helpful - sorry about that :( Didn't have time to implement something better.</li><li>There are 2 guns (iirc, maybe 3) hidden around town. They make things easier.</li><li>Aiming reticle will only show up if you have both a gun and some ammo.</li><li>Enemies may drop health (occasionally) or ammo (very rarely).</li><li>There's no sound nor music because I ran out of time.</li><li>Typos and misspelings are galore because everything was written in about an hour and because I ran out of time.</li><li>Some easter eggs were planned, but I ran out of time.</li><li>Despite pretending otherwise, this game is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the author\u2019s imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.<em> Milwaukee doesn't exist</em></li><li>I'm sorry</li></ul>\n<p><strong>ACTUAL CREDITS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Written and produced by Andy Kosakovsky (that's me!)<br/>for the Lost Cartridge Jam 2021 <br/>in just about 72 hours, <br/>spanning from 12:10AM of Friday, November 26 <br/>to 12:10AM of Monday, November 29, 2021\u00a0<br/>(however, the\u00a0actual number\u00a0of\u00a0hours\u00a0worked\u00a0is\u00a0closer to\u00a035) <br/>using the following tools and resources:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>ENGINE</strong>: Godot 3.4 </li><li><strong>GRAPHICS</strong>: GIMP, PaintNet, Blender 2.8, TrenchBroom</li><li><strong>FONTS</strong>: <em>Dogica</em> by Roberto Mocci, <em>Retroscape</em> by Robert Jablonski, <em>Metal Lord</em> by Ray Larabie</li><li><strong>SHADERS</strong>: Palette Filter by Fernando Brandt\u00a0(not\u00a0actually\u00a0in\u00a0use\u00a0in the\u00a0current\u00a0build,\u00a0but\u00a0the\u00a0code's\u00a0there)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4d/c4d0ba0ad73e2ca2362cb797fa27e16f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
