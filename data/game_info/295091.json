Play as sheepdogs and guide your flock to victory in four different game-modes by avoiding anvils, dodging dynamite, and bailing on boulders. <br/><br/>We've created this game for parties and family get-togethers, and only requires one controller for two-player, or two controllers for four-player. Controls are simple, and anyone - young or old - can join in and follow the herd. It's a small game for short sessions, and currently a work-in-progress! Don't get sheepish, come back frequently to see our progress as we polish the game for launch.Co-OpChallenge your high-scores in a time trial, or hold out for as long as humanly possible in Endless mode.VersusWho's a good sheepdog?! <strong> You are! </strong> Look after your flock while trying to drive your opponents sheep into danger, or compete over territory in King of the Hill. Chow down on dog biscuits to run faster, drop anvils on your opponents, and lure sheep with tasty carrots.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:26:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c88320b18c60331b120de40fe3ab80bd.jpg", "website": "http://www.disobedientsheep.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["SicklyDove games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SicklyDove games"], "esrb_rating": null}
