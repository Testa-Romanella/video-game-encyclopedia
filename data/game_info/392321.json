Many heroes, with their own purposes, set foot on the road of conquering the three thousand worlds of the galaxy. In the background of this chaotic war, a greater crisis of galaxy destruction is about to come.<br/>\"For the surviving of human beings, please die with the one billion people on this planet.\"<br/>\u2014\u2014 attributed to Wenchang Lord, the notorious Imperial War Minister<br/><br/><br/>In Chaos Galaxy, you can choose the 4 major fleets of the Galaxy Empire, or another one in the 14 factions, such as pirates, mercenaries, trader guilds, orders, assassins, and the disasters of AI. Each faction has a completely different background story, characteristic arms, and faction policy tree.<br/>There are more than 100 kinds of mecha and warships, dozens of weapons and dozens of unit skills in the game. More than 50 commanders with their own unique skills and story set came on the stage. The future of the galaxy is up to you whether you want to revive the Empire or overthrow it, whether you want to establish church rule, or whether you want to play AI to destroy mankind.<br/>The program, art, and design of Chaos Galaxy are all completed by one developer alone.<br/><br/>The game demo is now available for download. You can choose the Northsky Fleet to fight against their old enemy, the Emishi Pirates!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T03:28:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/330/3307a95f158803c2918a3d7275e35083.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 15, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Han Zhiyu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Han Zhiyu"], "esrb_rating": null}
