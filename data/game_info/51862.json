Gore, fantasy sci-fi, robots, aliens, and apocalyptic scenarios blend in perfectly with our vision for an action packed adventure, so in the end LVL99 AxeRage is a reflection of all the badass brutal stuff we enjoy, and we hope you can enjoy it as well!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3ca260558d413a19ef94afa618c33f50.jpg", "website": "https://sites.google.com/view/axerage/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 406, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Master UOMU"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Master UOMU"], "esrb_rating": null}
