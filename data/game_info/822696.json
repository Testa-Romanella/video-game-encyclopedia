They change your maximum speed and velocity of each of 4-directional movement commands.</p>\n<p>At least you can reroll those dices into other numbers, or even change the type of dice!</p>\n<p>Your objective? Reach to the finish line! But there will be obstacles awaiting for you...</p>\n<p><strong>OBSTACLES:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You'll encounter several obstacles, other than those dices, such as buttons and correspondent doors, unmeltable ice blocks that blocks your path, colored paths that are only walkable with the correct dice color and bumpers that will want to push you off the edge of the course.\r\n</p>\n<p>The best part? Every time you get out of the course, you start at the beginning of the level! Also, there's no time limit in each of all 12 levels this game has.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to move the ball, you only need to use WASD or the arrows of the keyboard. You can also use a controller for the game. In order to select the options of a menu, you can also use the mouse to select what you want.\r\n</p>\n<p>Also, in order to choose what type of dice you want to use to control your movement and/or reroll, use keypad 1/2/3/4 for keyboard or the 4 buttons of the controller (for Xbox and Playstation controller, use A/B/X/Y and Cross/Circle/Square/Triangle buttons, respectively).</p>\n<p><strong>PATCH NOTES:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>v1.0.0.0:<ul><li>Released version to the public.</li></ul></li><li>v1.0.0.1:<ul><li>Added a quality of life change in the collision of bumpers; now it has an visual indicator when hit;</li><li>Adjusted some object positions at levels 8 and 12.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Music:</em>\n</p>\n<p>- Andres Vilches Cortes.
