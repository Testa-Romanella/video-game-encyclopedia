Controls are Z and X keys.</p><p> Hold down the Z or X keys to gain altitude. Hover your castle above the dragons. Any dragons flying through your castles rocket jets will be incinerated scoring you a point. But if you are in the path of the dragons flame breath the dragons will score a point. Also beware, your rocket engines will cut out automatically should you dare fly too high. Perhaps if you score ten before the dragons do you can declare your self the winner. But can dragons and castles ever live in peace together?\r\n </p>\n<p>Created as a small surprise for visitors, and those unable to attend Chunky Fringe. <br/></p>\n<p>Once the file is loaded in the spectrum and the graphics characters are drawn to the screen only the colour attributes change. Giving it a blocky look but allowing the whole screen to be updated swiftly. It would have been possible to update the text as things went along, but The High Fortress is an experiment in working on the spectrum this way. It's a throwback to an earlier era of games too. With a bit of influence of the weirder spectrum games from the first few years of its life. Hopefully the video tennis style scoring gives you an idea of the scope of it.\u00a0 Think of it as a strange\u00a0 type in listing that you haven\u2019t had to type in yourself.<br/></p>\n<p>Follow the creator of The High Fortress on twitter @s_daly<br/><br/></p>\n<p>SPECTRUM REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p>Click download from the link below to get the Spectrum tap file.
