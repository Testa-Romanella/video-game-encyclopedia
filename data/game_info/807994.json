Select from a variety of arms, legs, torsos, and guns to dramatically change how your character performs. Additionally, changing the head allows you to play as one of three unique personalities, each with its own story. During the day, you will fight in a squad against gray goo on one of three distinctive maps, which requires you to make use of your stamina bar and magazine size. At night you will sit around your squad's campfire and learn more about the characters, especially the combat engineer that maintains your robot. Lastly, the game has sound effects, music, custom spritework, and cutscenes to remain engaging from the first deployment to the last stand. <br/></p>\n\n<p>So get <strong>GOCKED</strong> and <strong>PRIMED,</strong> <em>BITCH.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>WASD to move<br/></em></p>\n<p>Press X to enter Shoot mode</p>\n<p>Right click Aim</p>\n<p>Left click Fire</p>\n<p>If anything breaks exit to main menu and it should bring you to the same battle as before<br/></p>\n\n<p>Content Warnings:</p>\n<p>Death</p>\n<p>Swears</p>\n<p>Dark themes<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T14:33:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b21/b21fdf690dab9bd0cc266c5bd8687b31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevZoZo"], "genres": ["Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
