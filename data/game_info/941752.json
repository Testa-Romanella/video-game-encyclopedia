When your brother (one of the top authority figures of the city) and other members of the council go missing, and creatures seem to start lurking around the city, you and your friends are left to solve the mystery and keep the city safe. Will keeping the city together mean you have to sacrifice others?</p>\n\n<p>This was one of my final projects from my freshmen year at Quinnipiac University, and a demo of a visual novel I am hoping to complete in the future! The character designs/concepts and script were written by me. The character art was created by Jason May (@knauxic on Instagram and Twitter). The background art, miscellaneous sprites, and music were found online.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T10:40:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdc21f9827a9bb74684a1088f8235d9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aoconnorj"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
