{"id": 373962, "slug": "vecter", "name": "Vecter", "name_original": "Vecter", "description": "Vecter is a fast-paced runner (and at some point shooter) game where your goal is to survive by the skin of your teeth. You get in your ship, you push the throttle on max, rip it out of the console and then try to survive for as long as possible.<br/><br/>There are obstacles, there are enemies, there are power-ups and there will be plenty more to come! I hope you're good at staring contests because you will not have the luxury of blinking!<br/><br/>I hope you like retro wireframe graphics because I'm all about that. synthwave is my jam!<br/><br/>One important thing to note is that Vecter does not have a road-map, or a planed out future. There is a trello board with features that I plan on implementing and the feature request channel on the Vecter discord server.<br/><br/>I'm a one-man dev team, and I'm making this game purely out of passion around all of my other IRL commitments, so development sometimes may be slow. It's a hobby and a damn fun one at that but at this stage it's still just a hobby.<br/><br/>There is a first release planned on the 1st of July, other than that there's nothing much more I can really say. Feel free to ask questions if you want, I'm quite liberal with information about the game.<br/><br/>Among other things I'm also making an arcade version of vecter complete with it's own cabinet.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T02:14:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b0544e133f91454deb3031e6e86c07f7.jpg", "website": "https://www.vecter.online", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 37, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["taranasus"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Taranasus"], "esrb_rating": null}
