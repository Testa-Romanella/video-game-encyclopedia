There are also Special Worlds, which the more levels there are, the more fun!</p>\n<p>(You can only unlock Special Worlds by not using warp pipes. The game was meant to be played fully, and if you use warp pipes then, it's up to you.)</p>\n<p>(Also,\u00a0If you accidentally notice an error regarding the game, level, object... make sure you report to me.
