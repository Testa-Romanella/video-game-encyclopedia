This game is the result.</p>\n<p>It's a first-person shooter where your shotgun has limited range and everything is a one-shot. For the people who like to hit tricks, there is a grapple implemented which can be enabled within the match settings.</p>\n<p>The game can sometimes be buggy which is expected with a game made in just 10 hours.</p>\n<p>There is a possibility that I will update the game in the future with bug fixes, new game modes, and general improvements. But since I don't have much time and resources it won't be in the near future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T16:02:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/301/30147355a4e88b0735d943557ac1c181.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SenpaiKisser"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
