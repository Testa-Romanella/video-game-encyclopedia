Fly low enough to not be picked up on radar or be spotted by patrolling enemy aircraft, but not so low that you crash into the ground! Hug canyons and valleys to avoid detection. Once at the objective, drop your package, making sure to hit the target location. After the package is dropped, escape back to friendlier skies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T04:52:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/2128fc0b774f0ca4097a61e8f35a64ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew Briggs"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
