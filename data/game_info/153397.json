You are alone at the planet in a galaxy far, far away, planet's atmosphere is deadly and radiation is strong, you would't survive there even for a second. Fortunately, you are under the protecting dome, but do do not rush to rejoice, robots out there want to kill you and destroy the dome generator. Killing robots gives you scrap that can be used to build turrets and generators. Turrets help you to kill more robots and generators make the dome bigger. So, your goal is to protect the dome for\u00a010 minutes till help will come.
