(Don't waste items, if you die, you respawn and knowing where the extras are will be useful.)<br/><br/>You can also fool around climbing around on the structures and exploring the valley and\u00a0and stuff...<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong></p><ul><li>Sticks to move and turn.</li><li>Grips and Triggers to pick up or drop most things (including to/from lockers or pockets).</li><li>Grips for climbing...</li><li>Triggers to shoot or use health packs if you're holding them.\u00a0 (You can up your health slightly past 100% with health packs, but if you're at the max, then nothing will happen, so you can just put it back in your pocket).</li><li>Anything that's yellow and glowly (like your pockets or locker slots, or the locker handles, or the buttons on the computers) are things that you can interact with (for slots, you can put or take items from them, for the handles you can yank them open or closed, and for the buttons, you can press them -- like with your hand, or a gun... or a bullet...)</li></ul><p>Still no sound, not even finishable this time...</p><p>Bleh... as always: if only I\u00a0had another 2 weeks. \ud83d\ude05</p><p>Good luck everyone! \ud83d\ude42</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T10:02:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c35/c35774b597cd34f8a6bcb34c7d765a01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["BrainSlugs83"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
