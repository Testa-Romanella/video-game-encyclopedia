{"id": 731662, "slug": "rhythm-runner-simpduck", "name": "Rhythm Runner (SimpDuck)", "name_original": "Rhythm Runner (SimpDuck)", "description": "<p>Created in 3 hours for the Trijam game jam, Rhythm Runner is a simple runner game in which every move you make is added to your track.</p>\n<p>It is a one button runner so hopefully can be as inclusive as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For this iteration of the game. Press Spacebar to jump over obstacles. Every level you reach is a new track line.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately most features have not been fully realised or made visible in this prototype due to time restraint. If you would like to see the game fully realised and released potentially on android as well as itch.io let me know in the comments.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Missing features (either not implemented or visible/audible)</p>\n<p>1.) looping tracks (end of level you have produced a track)</p>\n<p>2.) Finish state that replays the track/run.</p>\n<p>3.) Variety in Instruments.</p>\n<p>4.) Extra jumps place markers/obstacles (current game only has pre-decided markers).</p>\n<p>5.) Post-processing. Making it look less... yeah.</p>\n\n<p>To see the progress on this game over the 3 hours, there will be a video realised on my YouTube channel in the coming days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T12:36:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/059/059d0c448592895e39d570c3216a126a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SimpDuck"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
