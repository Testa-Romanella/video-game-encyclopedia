Every day, you will have choices you can make that will allow you to decide if you want to risk putting yourself out there, or stay within the comfort and solace of your isolated tower. Each choice that you make will affect the outcome of the story, pulling you towards a more open, or more isolated view of the world around you. Keepless Nights allows players to simulate intentionally stressful situations for someone who is socially anxious. The goal is to help players realize they are not alone in their fears, experience such situations in a safe space, and encourage them to keep themselves open to new people and possibilities.
