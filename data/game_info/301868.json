However the official release __MAY__ be paid!<br/>---<br/>&gt;Q: Will it support auto-updates?<br/>---<br/>&gt;A: For automatic updates, consider downloading the itch app and then install it from there.<br/>---<br/>&gt;Q: What are the supporting languages?<br/>---<br/>&gt;A: For now the game language is English.

If you see any app using X-Space game or/and medias, please contact with us on our Discord!<br/>---<br/>&gt;Q: Can I play with a gamepad?<br/>---<br/>&gt;A: Yes, you can!<br/>---<br/>&gt;Q: What do I do in this game?<br/>---<br/>&gt;A: You just have to avoid the obstacles and reach to the end.<br/>Enemy rockets can hit you but can be killed by shooting them, Meteors can hit you but cannot be hit, Asteroids do not harm but colliding with them will result to stop you moving from your pointing direction and the cannot be destroyed, Purple Blocks act the same way with the asteroids but cannot be destroyed, Purple Bricks act the same way with Purple Blocks but can be destroyed, Red Blocks and Bricks act similar to the Purple ones but colliding with them will hit you and Bosses...well, they don't do much except an animation, they appear as a background object and gives the feeling that this is placing the obstacles. However Boss Battle System may change and more obstacles will be added!<br/>---<br/>&gt;Q: Is there a Multiplayer Mode?<br/>---<br/>&gt;A: Yes, you can play Local Co-op with your friend by hitting F2 on your keyboard or by hitting Y/\u0394 button on a second controller. There's no online multiplayer and if one player dies the level will restart! When the level is restarted, you have to press the Join button again! To leave hit Delete on your keyboard. More info about controls can be found on # Controls.<br/>---<br/>&gt;Q: Is there a Mod Support? What about a Level Editor?<br/>---<br/>&gt;A: No for both, sorry... But there may be in the future!<br/>---<br/>&gt;Q: What were the Programs you used to make it?<br/>---<br/>&gt;A: For Sprite Creation and Developing we used Gamemaker Studio 2 as for Music Creation we used Bosca Ceoil.</p>\n<p>More Questions will be added here soon!</p>\n<p>Tags:\u00a0 #arcade #retro #action #shooter #multiplayer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/725bad4e3fc70cda59fc26b9a6bdf6db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cookie Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
