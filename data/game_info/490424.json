The premise of Dragon Cave is that you are a dragon trainer with a seemingly unlimited lifespan who collects dragon eggs and raises them to become adults.</p>\n<p>Like many adoptables sites, the dragons are represented by graphics and are not actual living organisms, or even simulations. These graphics consist of sprites: small pixelated images that &quot;grow&quot; on your scroll (the scroll being a list attributed to your personal account, consisting of your dragons and their statistics). Based on time, clicks, and views, the dragon will hatch and grow into an adult. If certain requirements are not met (x amount of clicks/views) within a set time period, the egg or hatchling will die.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-09T02:47:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7ef93b46198626422106cf6934390f87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
