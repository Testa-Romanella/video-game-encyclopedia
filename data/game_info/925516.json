Everything is there, from the large scope to the seven endings. but a few of the secret areas lack dialogue, and music didn't make it in. But after this over a year of the ROM sitting on my desktop, I figured it should have some sort of life outside of my head and laptop. So here it is.</p>\n\n<p>A large amount of what is in my later games was actually born in this game, so it's a neat opportunity to look back at menus, battle scenes, and learning how to create some more cinematic scenes.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>The download contains the .ROM file, .pocket file, game manual, and a few extra pieces like the cover art. Don't want to charge anything for it, but any donations help the future development of games and are eternally appreciated.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AF+ER is the story of a child finding himself in a dreamworld, on that is a perfect reflection of the real one, but with a grim secret. And somehow these two worlds become almost seamlessly intertwined.<br/></p>\n\n<p>AF+ER is really about taking your time, exploring, and realizing choices you make may have rippling effects. In the dreamworld, you can search every nook of every house, and learn every NPCs darkest secrets, or merely get a voyeuristic insight into their life and motivation.</p>\n\n<p>Also keep in mind that sometimes the best decision is not choosing violence, but hey, sometimes violence makes for less resistance on your way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Button / X Key - Interact</p>\n<p>Start / Return Key - Menu</p>\n<p>Select / Shift Key - Map<br/></p>\n\n<p>Books are used as save points, so save often!</p>\n<p>If you'd like some nice background music, an\u00a0Ambient Mix would be a great option!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:11:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3c/f3c545107cf8604676d9f15c091d1569.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Horatiu.nyc"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
