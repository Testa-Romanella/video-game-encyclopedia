He is a walking, living white void - but on the inside of his body, there is an ocean. An ocean that stretches out towards infinity. And every day, he drags other students into that ocean, drowning them under the water for a minute or two, just to make them suffer before spitting them back out. Every day, he spills out more of the water from his body into the school, flooding it. The waters rise a little bit, every day, threatening to envelop everybody in the school.</p>\n<p>Everybody knows this is happening. Everybody knows Michael is doing it.</p>\n<p>Nobody is doing anything about it. And nobody is going to do anything about it.</p>\n<p>Jackson Middle School is drowning, and everyone is getting used to it.</p>\n<p><em>A short horror story, written in twine, about bullying, and who faces punishment.
