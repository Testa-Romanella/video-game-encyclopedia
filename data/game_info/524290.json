The idea is that the player has a list of tasks they must complete in a set amount of time, and it's up to you to figure out how to best get it all done. I figured this would work well for the jam since the theme is \"Cutting Corners\".\u00a0Not only did I join the jam late, but I spent way too long for a solo developer working on the environment.</p>\n<p>This prototype of the game only has 2 tasks to complete, and each segment is set to only take 10 seconds. I do plan to spend some time post-jam adding in the rest of the tasks, getting the game loop tied up, and adding in some very needed sounds and music.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD - Movement<br/>Shift - Jog/Run (Inside/Outside)<br/>E - Use<br/>TAB - View Task List<br/>Alt+F4 - Close the game (currently no in-game menu)</p><p><em><strong>!Currently on hold while I work on another game jam!</strong></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:25:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d54/d543f0fb2b688db306935ca5568ef355.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeepFriedOreo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
