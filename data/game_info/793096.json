However, soon after, enemy troops invaded the village and kidnapped the time traveler. This unexpected attack made us believe that what the stranger informed us about might be true. Thus, your mission is to eliminate the invading troops and rescue the time traveler.\r\nYou can attack enemies with your sword, or by shooting arrows. Note that you have a limited amount of arrows! And make sure you eat well and don\u2019t die of hunger.\r\nThere are also many items in the village that might be of use to you. Make sure you take anything that you might need. Of these items, there are potions that can make you invincible, give you health and increase your damage.\r\nGood luck on your mission<p>MADVERSE: Rewound was created in two weeks.
