After you enter the room hoping to find a way out, you trigger an alarm. Entities will now start coming toward you. Survive for 5 days and your team will rescue you.\r\n</p>\n<p>Gameplay\r\n</p>\n<p>For the first 4 nights, you will have to deal with a new entity and a new mechanic every night. The Fith night will be the harder version of the fourth night.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is the second game I ever made so there will probably be some bugs, I have also never used blender before so the entities and the rooms don't look too good. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T13:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/324/324afb9f4123b2e75c81718b8f4a8375.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hyfer_dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
