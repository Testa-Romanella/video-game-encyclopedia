Same lose conditions apply to you as well. <strong>CORES</strong> produce <strong>POWER</strong>, <strong>WEAPONS</strong>\u00a0use it to destroy opponent\u2019s <strong>MODULES</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>The <strong>MODULE</strong> is destroyed once every tile of it is damaged. Do take notice that <strong>CORES</strong> explode when destroyed, damaging nearby (non-diagonal) tiles. </p>\n<p>Most <strong>WEAPONS</strong> have penetration stat which reflects the number of undamaged tiles it can go through. For example, <strong>PISTOL</strong> can only target leftmost tiles in the opponent\u2019s body since it has penetration of 1.</p>\n<p><strong>WEAPONS</strong> also <strong>OVERHEAT</strong> during the battle - each consecutive shot from any weapon costs 1 more <strong>POWER</strong>. This value is reset once the battle is over.</p>\n<p>After the battle you can salvage any <strong>MODULES</strong> that have at least one intact tile left, but your space is limited, so you will need to balance your <strong>CORE</strong> / <strong>WEAPON</strong> ratio wisely.</p>\n<p>At one point in the game your\u00a0<strong>CORES</strong> will most likely start malfunctioning.\u00a0Brace yourself and keep going.</p>\n<ul><li>A game by @ampersandbear.\u00a0</li><li>Writing by @yenneash.\u00a0</li><li>Music\u00a0by\u00a0@collapseboy.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 39.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bd/9bda45e6d4fe0226469054404d3433b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ampersandbear"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
