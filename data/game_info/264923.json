Save My Pixel is a simple but extremely addictive 1-button game where you bounce and dodge the bit smashers (obstacles) and survive as long as you can. <br/><br/>You are in control of protecting the only pixel inside the bit smashing equipment that keeps forwarding deadly spikes and smashers at you. Each time you bounce and avoid the obstacles (by tapping anywhere on the screen), you score a point. Score higher each time to get to the top of the leaderboard. You also get to unlock new achievements as you score higher. The game's speed increases and gets more challenging as you score more points.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4dab6a4a887e3f567cb545b79ff39d83_N5BR0KF.jpg", "website": "http://jsplash.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["JSplash Apps"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["JSplash Apps"], "esrb_rating": null}
