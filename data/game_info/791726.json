Different tactics must be used against different monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bricks don't just appear out of  air. Look at our craftsmen, who work day and night collecting wood, stone, bronze and jade to make blocks. Wood blocks can be produced quickly, stone blocks are balanced, bronze blocks are strong and heavy,  crystal blocks are fragile and deadly. With good resource management, the battle is half won.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Assign your warriors to the front lines, erect shields, operate crossbows, repair holes, fire cannons. These brave warriors are honored to share your burden, so that you can better manage the larger picture. You know, the strongest wall is always the soldier's shoulder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Free the occupied areas step by step, earn the bonus shield, unlock new attachments and spells. Failure does not matter, perhaps you can change the strategy to win it back.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T06:57:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4a5b19f713695c5ee6bb01be63b6b5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u559c\u4eba\u4e00\u4e2a"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gamera Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
