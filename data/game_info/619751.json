So I decided to go for a more philosophical interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>What would happen if you could detach from your body and join the body of another thing? Well, you would be able to reach new places, but you still need to care for your body...\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So this is my interpretation of the theme, break the connection with your body and join a different one. I tried to make it into a puzzle platformer but I'm not the best level designer... still hope the game is understandable!</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy this little game I made on my own in the last 48 hours, time to rest now! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e08/e088992e54de986fb471b8cc01368f77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ErikTheBerik"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
