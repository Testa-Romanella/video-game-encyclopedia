The gameplay focuses on linear platformer levels with semi-complex movement. A little under halfway through, you get a grappling hook to help with exploration. I'm not sure if I'll make this into a full game, but if I do, there will be a full story and many more features.\u00a0 So far, nothing is final (especially the audio) and it is still fairly buggy,\u00a0but it should represent the overall idea of the game.
