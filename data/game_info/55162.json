Warhead is known for its strong alien atmosphere, reasonably realistic space kinematics and a fish-eye perspective through which the space is viewed. It was created by Glyn Williams in 1989.</p>\n<p>The game takes place during a war between the alien forces of Sirius and the humans of Earth. The player fights for the Earth forces. The game is played as sequential missions. Completing a mission successfully lets the player advance to the next mission. It is possible to save the game status after each mission, but not during a mission. Typical mission objectives include intelligence gathering, search and rescue missions, destroying enemies and protecting friendly forces. The player is sent for missions from the SolBase, a military base orbiting the Sun. The player must travel to different solar systems using a device that allows faster than light travel through quad-space, which is a form of hyperspace.</p>\n<p>Warhead spawned a spiritual sequel, XF5700 Mantis.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/432/432b4ea65cc1fc68030a6166f98edf1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST"], "developers": ["Motion Picture House"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": null}
