The theme was Out of Control so in our game you play as a friendly dragon whose body was taken over by an evil wizard to destroy a village. While the wizard controls your speed and attack, you can still stop him. By momentarily changing your direction and jumping to avoid your attack from hitting anybody, you can make your way to his tower while trying to leave as much of the village unharmed as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45ffe0c0495a04e730bb359a94e65f0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["the_duke_of_squares"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
