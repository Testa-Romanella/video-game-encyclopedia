Just wanted to implement an idea of a card throwing game\u00a0I had and built a level around the mechanic.

You spawn cards by holding grip and throw by releasing grip\u00a0with a throwing motion. Shoot the red bricks. You need to turn off the lights, turn on the TV and turn on the PS in order to feel like you won then exit the program with ALT-F4 :).\u00a0</p>\n<p>TODO:\u00a0UI, Audio, Better models, better lights and\u00a0everything else.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T08:26:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e88/e88c9497ed69cc8a0bc3a24f433c5917.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YankiDev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
