Some have interesting things to say <br/>\r\nand some of them will even join you on your quest.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is turnbased combat, leveling, gearing-up, worldmap, ect... <br/>\r\nAll the classic components an old-school RPG should have.<br/>\r\nThere is also a big deal of humor, slightly sexual conversations and secrets to encounter! <br/>\r\nInstead of \"potions\", \"Elexirs\", \"Phoenix-Downs\", ... <br/>\r\nYou have \"Beer\", \"Whiskey\", \"Wine\", ...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSoooo...
