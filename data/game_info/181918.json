{"id": 181918, "slug": "predator-defender", "name": "Predator Defender", "name_original": "Predator Defender", "description": "<p>Predator Defender is an adapted version of the arcade game: <em>Block Breaker</em>. This game requires you to beat a series of levels all increasing in difficulty using only a ball, a paddle, and a variety of power-ups. </p><p>This game took the most work, requiring me to learn how to manipulate the OnGUI() to print the lives and the score to the screen. Some of the other features of this game include adjusting the amount of hits each brick can take and getting the bricks to be called in the script into various designs. </p><p>In conclusion, this project has by far been one of the most difficult, pushing me to make more levels and script the bullets and power-ups. In the future I plan to add more levels and a boss level that will be much harder than the rest. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57f3bbc34efb032a977f65a302f5c5c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kronosreaper"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
