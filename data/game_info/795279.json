It is a storydriven boss-rush title that offers intense and challenging combat catered towards experienced players that are used to the Action &amp; RPG genres. Equipped with a simple kit of actions, the player takes on unique bosses that bring their own mechanics and layout to the arena. Utilize the environment that each encounter brings to make sure you prevail in The Breaking Pit!</p>\n<p>Offense is not the best defense. You will need to make good use of the blocking ability if you\u00a0\u00a0want to stand a chance.\u00a0Without any kind of dash or utility to avoid damage, blocking attacks is essential for staying in the fight. Time them well in order to perform a perfect block, and use the opportunity to retaliate!<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Developed to be played with a controller</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\nCredits - Plus Five Collective\r\n<p><strong>Christos Mandilas\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Designer, Narrative Designer, Writer, Animator, 3D Artist, Voice Actor<br/></p>\n<p>(Email: christos.mandilas.8738@student.uu.se)</p>\n<p><strong>Isak Larsson</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lead Designer, Level Designer, Quality Assurance</p>\n<p>(Email: isak.s.larsson@gmail.com)</p>\n<p><strong>Robin Lundqvist\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Producer, Project Manager, Game Designer<br/></p>\n<p>(Email: robin.lundqvist.0387@student.uu.se)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Dionysios Adamopoulos\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Game Designer, UI Programmer, Narrative Programmer, Gameplay Programmer</p>\n<p>(Email: dionysios.adamopoulos.1687@student.uu.se, Discord:\u00a0DionGreat#3736)</p>\n<p><strong>Sergei Grigorev\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>AI Programmer, Tools Programmer, Gameplay Programmer, Game Designer</p>\n<p>(Email: sergeigrigorev.net@gmail.com, Discord:\u00a0tuchki#7284)</p>\n<p><strong>Maximilian Feig\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>VFX Artist, Sound Designer, Composer, UI Artist, Game Designer</p>\n<p>(Email: maximilian.feig.2927@student.uu.se)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Erik B\u00f6rjesson\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Character Designer, 3D Artist, Environment Designer, Promotional Art, UI Artist, Game Designer</p>\n<p>(Email: erik.borjesson.2188@student.uu.se)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Adam Westeson\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Animator, Character Designer, 3D Artist, Game Designer</p>\n<p>(Email: adam.westeson.1627@student.uu.se)<br/></p>\n\r\nSpecial thanks to\r\n<p><strong>Nektarios Georgiadis -\u00a0</strong>Voice Actor</p>\n<p><strong>Konstantinos Repanis -\u00a0</strong>Voice Actor</p>\r\nSocials\r\n<p>Indomitable.se<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Facebook.com/PlusFiveCollective<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Instagram.com/Plusfivecollective/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T16:54:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e6113f15ef077df56d17329b0f3713f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plus5Collective"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
