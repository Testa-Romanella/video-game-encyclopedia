But after working on it on and off for a little bit I've finally have a rough but playable prototype.</p>\n<p>As it's a little rough the webpage has a handy redraw button when you get into the main game in case the character's don't draw properly at first. If they don't just hit that button a few times and it should look okay</p>\r\nThings I plan to look at in the future\r\n<ul><li>The web interface doesn't scale to fit the screen so it's currently at a ratio of 320x480px (just in case someone is using a phone that might use that resolution)</li><li>Optimise the character rendering on the webpage so it doesn't draw each part separately and potentially out of order</li><li>Handle people opening the webpage when a game is in progress properly. At the moment if a user loads the page when a game is not at the main menu their webpage mage start updating when other game related messages are sent to them.</li><li>Add settings menu to the game</li><li>Improve the webpage so it looks less prototypie</li><li>Improve the general flow of the game</li><li>and finally update the programmer art! :P</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b5/3b5c54d3ace91de384f98fa8073fe053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Haygarth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
