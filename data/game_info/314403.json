I\u00a0wanted to challenge myself to make a game in a few days, and actually complete said game. This is my first released game, however I am not really new to UE4, or blueprints. I just get way too ahead of myself when making video games.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Anywho, its a simple FPS game, get to the end, fight the boss, and win!</p>\n<p>Constructive criticism is definitely welcome. As I said, I just wanted to challenge myself to make a small game, and release it. I\u00a0made the engine incredibly simple to modify, so I might just give away the project file so anyone can modify it if they like.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/817/8172d4d24182213398361e724550f454.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AGGStudios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
