Discover their secrets and experience first-hand how these wonders of a bygone world lived and died right before your very eyes! Can you spot the Ankylosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Compsognathus, Dilophosaurus, Dimetrodon, Oviraptor, Parasaurolophus, Pteranodon, Spinosaurus, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus Rex, and the vicious Velociraptor!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis zoo-like experience is fairly simple. The user navigates around an island using teleport style navigation common to VR controllers (in this early release version the Rift touch controllers are the only controllers available). The user can click the trigger button and aim at any particular type of dinosaur to play a brief audio narration.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c274d5d15cfeb80992dde41c28497c89.jpg", "website": "http://www.hollowhead.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hollowhead"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Hollowhead"], "esrb_rating": null}
