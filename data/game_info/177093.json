Sounds simple enough - but wait! The level's not there! Or is it?</p><p>The only way the platforms and traps beyond can be revealed is with the blood of dead players. Use your failures to find the way out of the incredibly difficult levels!</p><p>In free-for-all mode, everyone plays at the same time, and everyone respawns a few seconds after dying. The same goes in simultaneous, except that all players respawn only when everyone is dead. And in turn-based mode, players take turns while the others have three anti-power ups which they can strategically deploy on the active player.</p><p>Play in browser here!<br/></p><p>Made by:</p><p>Mathias Hj\u00f8rne Fynbo</p><p>Frederik Schmidt Knudsen</p><p>Bo Sejer la Cour</p><p>Carsten Michael Rosenkilde Nielsen</p><p>Praveen S Namasivayam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/8307cbcefa5c77ffb76aa88d87fe1307.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PNam19"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
