In its pages you will find everything you need to take your Agents -Survivors in this case- to a post-apocalyptic world. This document includes twelve new archetypes for Survivors, history tables and off-camera trajectory; a chapter on travel, animals and vehicles; another one on weapons; and another one related to the people that can be encountered. Also included are examples of camps, settlements and regions, missions, encounter tables and an example region: Larimer County, Colorado. And of course, rules and descriptions for you to bring the infected responsible for the apocalypse to life... or death. Or whatever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T11:19:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e11/e11e698dbdd87301dd06aab74051ab33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juancho Duma"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
