I'm Mokka and I'm an artist, and this is the first game jam I have entered where I have done the code for a game completely by myself (after learning C# non-stop for about two months). I'm really proud of this project, but it's still currently a prototype as it took me a long time to code things and I still drew all the art from scratch as well (which means unfortunately there are things missing).<br/>However, I really love what I've made and will continue to update it once the jam is over. There's so much more I wanted to add! :D</p><p>Please let me know what you think of it so far, as I would really appreciate any feedback.\u00a0Thanks!<br/><br/></p><p><strong>BITTER BREWS<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>Far away in a distant land an evil witch cast a spell and an eternal winter befell the world.\u00a0Tucked away into a pocket of a mountain is a cosy cafe that serves warm potions to those in need.\u00a0</em><em>Will the world ever escape this bitter curse?</em></p>\n<ul><li>Make up to 10 different brews for a variety of fantasy customers</li><li>Mix and match 12 different ingredients in your cauldron by dragging ingredients</li><li>Customers full of character!</li></ul><p><strong>COMING SOON:</strong></p><ul><li>More customers (at least 10 total)</li><li>A record of all brews you have made, along with the recipes to make them</li><li>A proper intro to the game with LORE\u2122 and a proper title screen</li><li>A boss encounter with the winter witch</li><li>Customer expression changes</li><li>Customer shenanigans</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:36:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/166/1666a7c5178679b59b99fa8663136565.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MokkaQuill"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
