Regular wild ravens with swords and armor raid regularly into the clearing. The wizard must hide behind the mighty shoulder of the defender, and at the same time strengthen his attacks with strong potions. Reds give strength to defeat the bosses clothed in bloody armor. The blue gives the opportunity to defeat the ravens in ice armor. Having sipped the green potion our heroes are connected by a deadly ray that destroys everything in the way . The yellow jar will throw the enemies away from the defender away. You have to control the sorcerer with classic direction keys, and a strong bouncer with the mouse cursor (so you can even play with your friends). Protect me, and I I'll help you do it more effectively.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb5/eb5b771f4ecbc5dba93472da87614dcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 60, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LillyWelland"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bitlock Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
