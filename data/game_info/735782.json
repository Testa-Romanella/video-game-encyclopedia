{"id": 735782, "slug": "continuity-puzzlerme", "name": "Continuity (puzzlerme)", "name_original": "Continuity (puzzlerme)", "description": "<p>Continuity is a life simulation where you can create up to eight species and modify four different parameters and visualize the growth of each species in a graph.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The graph shows the count of creatures in each species growing in timesteps. You can consider timesteps as years. <strong>Species </strong>and <strong>creatures </strong>are different terms. <strong>Creatures </strong>make up <strong>species</strong> and <strong>creatures </strong>in the same species have the same parameters.</p>\n<p>Parameters (0 - 100%):</p>\n<p>Spawn - Every timestep, each <strong>species </strong>is given a chance - the Spawn chance - to create a single new <strong>creature</strong>. This is to kickstart the <strong>species</strong>.</p>\n<p>Reproduction - Every timestep, each <strong>creature</strong> is given a chance - the Reproduction chance - to replicate. This is what causes <strong>species </strong>to exponentially grow.</p>\n<p>Death - Every timestep, there is a chance - the Death chance - for each <strong>creature </strong>to die.</p>\n<p>Mutation - Every timestep, each <strong>creature </strong>is given a chance - the Mutation chance - to mutate into a user-defined\u00a0<strong>species</strong>. This is (in my opinion) the most interesting parameter to change and causes the most volatility.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that this is a work in progress (and is my first proper Unity project), so please notify me if you encounter any errors, need help, or just want to give some feedback!<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T07:12:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0b/c0b2280360f0b50be848233a2ae3c2ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["puzzlerme"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
