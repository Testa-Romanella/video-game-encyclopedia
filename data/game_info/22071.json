It's updated to run better on today's computer and ironed out a few issues. <br/><br/>Tower!2011:SE is not an arcade game. With a complex command structure, advanced AI and Speech Recognition technology Tower!2011:SE will allow you to experience of the thrill of being a real air traffic controller.<br/><br/>Your assignment is to guide aircraft of various sizes and capabilities to and from the active runway for landing and takeoff. As TOWER you must assure that it safe for a plane to enter or cross a runway, assign taxiway routes, when to stop and start movement, and clear aircraft for take off.
