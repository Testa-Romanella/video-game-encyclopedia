Each robot is embodied by players : 1 disfunctionnal (Player 1)\u00a0vs 3 crewmates (others Players).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Disfunctionnal </strong>: You are quicker to destroy than the crew to repair, and you roll quicker than them. Use these perks to let the ship explode !\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Crewmates </strong>: Split-up to repair many spots at the same time or stay together to repair one very quickly. If an ally is destroyed, find your way to repair him !</p>\n<p><strong>Win condition</strong> :\u00a0The Crew win if they manage to fully repair the ship or if they have repaired 4 out of 5 spots by the end of the timer.
