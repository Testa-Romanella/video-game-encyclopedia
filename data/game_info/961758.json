{"id": 961758, "slug": "horos-monster-slayer-and-lover-of-many", "name": "HOROS - monster slayer and lover of many", "name_original": "HOROS - monster slayer and lover of many", "description": "\u201cPeople say it was a miracle I survived. My wounds\u2026 they were too deep; I should\u2019ve been dead three times over. I was lying in a pool of my blood when they found me, babbling like a madman. The farmers were inclined to end my misery and spare me needless suffering, but they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to kill someone in cold blood, so they dragged my not quiet corpse to the stables to let me die in warmth, at least a bit of comfort. Except\u2026 I didn\u2019t.<br/><br/>When they saw I was alive and recovering, improving\u2026 they took me to Swingmore. There\u2019s an innkeeper here, a good woman who wants to take care of me and let me\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know nearly anything. But here I can rest till I\u2019m ready to decide. To decide who I am, and maybe discover who I was.\u201d<br/><br/>This is how you got your new name, Horos, and the man you became. The monster-slayer, the lover of many. The seeker of what you lost.<br/><br/><h3>CHARACTERS</h3>During his quest, Horos meets many people \u2013 from cutthroat merchants to literal cutthroats to people more interested in\u2026 other parts of his anatomy. While designing the characters, we\u2019ve tried to adhere to the fantasy spirit by adding unique, distinctive features to each of them. Lithe, nymph-like women will stand aside ones with more rotund curves, and you will also find those that are not so easily described.<br/><br/>The innkeeper Lucretia will try to nurture you with her motherly side, Kara, the blacksmith\u2019s daughter, is quite ready to be nurtured herself, and Fabiana, the leader of the Majestic Owl cult\u2026 well, you\u2019ll have to find that out by yourself. Mandy is ready to work some magic (the witchcraft kind), Teriani will do as elves do (repeatedly), and Lady Aleneitte will show you what nobles do with their husband\u2019s permission. This is by no means exhausting, but Horos will undoubtedly be exhausted by the end.<br/><br/><h3>SEX SCENES</h3>Let\u2019s put it this way: in what other games have you gone from helping a recently resurrected necromancer celebrate her return to the land of the living only to take a friendly vampire in a threesome with the shopkeeper girl? Of course, this is just the tip (heh) of the proverbial iceberg, but we wouldn\u2019t want to spoil everything for you yet.<br/>And the story part won\u2019t be the only one where we get innovative. The animations will be rendered in 40 frames, the best-looking, most fluid we\u2019ve ever made, and they won\u2019t be just a slideshow. We\u2019ll add some random elements to them, but we\u2019ll also work to make them more interactive than ever \u2013 just as a small preview: every position will have its associated cumshot, so look forward to painting the ladies white any way you like. Again and again.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><h3>DIVERSIFIED SCENERY</h3>We\u2019ve spent a long time getting each location right, from inception to design to final render. But the work put into each individual background doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve limited ourselves to a few key scenes. No: this project doubles, or maybe even triples, the number of locations of our most expansive projects to date.<br/><br/>You will begin your story in Swingmore, a small town in the middle of nowhere, and from there, you\u2019ll travel through swamps, deserts, diverse forests, deadlands, and much more. Every environment will throw new enemies at you \u2013 from the desert-dwelling, scimitar-wielding goblins to acolytes with their magics and swordmasters\u2026 and that\u2019s just in one place!<br/><br/>In the three available towns and in many hidden places throughout the game (a hut in the swamp, a tent in the desert,\u2026), you\u2019ll find characters to interact with, be it through trade or sprawling dialogs, intriguing quests, or\u2026. Well, you remember what the game is about, don\u2019t you? Yes, there\u2019ll be plenty of that.  <br/><br/><h3>A SIMPLE RPG GAME</h3>Simple doesn\u2019t mean incomplete: looting defeated enemies and abandoned treasure, equipping yourself with armor, weapons, and assorted items to increase both your stats and chances, and, of course, combat. Don\u2019t worry. The story's focus will still be the erotic encounters, and we won\u2019t bog you down with a cumbersome system, but you\u2019ll still face many enemies, some of which you will overpower and some that will require a bit of cunning from you. <br/><br/>Goblins, skeletons, zombies, and the like won\u2019t stop you for long, but when you get to the trolls, wyverns, or other scaly threats\u2026 Well, that\u2019s where the fun starts. Dragons, after all, think armor makes you crunchier.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-05T03:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dd/1dd9c18428d5625c7328fc14670212fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 577, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Lesson of Passion"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lesson of Passion"], "esrb_rating": null}
