In \"States of the Union\", you take on a solid state of matter, splitting yourself into up to three additional pieces and solving puzzles through the (currently) two levels. In order to complete levels, you need to regain enough of your previous splits, join them back together, and pass into the end goal. We hope you enjoy what we've made in this 48 hour period!</p>\n\n<p>The entire process was streamed to Twitch\u00a0here\u00a0(the first video in the set).
