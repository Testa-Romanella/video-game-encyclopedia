It's a prototype meant to demonstrate some basic parts of a new game in a new IP where the player explores the Well Between Worlds.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>The demo you can play here would at most be called an <strong>early pre-alpha version</strong> of the game we imagined we would build.</em></p>\r\nOverview\r\n<p>Down the Well is a game about exploring a mysterious underworld and finding purpose in it.\u00a0 Throughout development we planned to explore the game's themes in deeper ways.<br/><br/>In this demo you can familiarize yourself a bit with the atmosphere of the world, follow Tay on a short scenario through the tunnels of the Well and have an audience with the Warden of the Forest. <br/></p>\n<p>Everything made here is or was very much WIP and we used it mainly to showcase the project to publishers and investors. We even have a disclaimer in the beginning of the demo from that time! <br/><br/>Future of the project is uncertain.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The demo can only be played properly with a controller. We recommend using an Xbox One or a PS4 controller.</p>\n<p>The game contains in-game tutorials and will introduce the different mechanics and inputs as you progress through the demo level.<br/></p>\r\nLicense\r\n<p>The specific demo distributed on this page is licensed under Creative Commons as defined through the link below.
