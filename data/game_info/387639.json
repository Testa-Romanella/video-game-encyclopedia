{"id": 387639, "slug": "cave-of-illusions-itch", "name": "Cave of Illusions (itch)", "name_original": "Cave of Illusions (itch)", "description": "<p>Cave of Illusions surrounds a series of events in Looninville, New Hampshire, where an eight-year-old girl vanishes abruptly. Her name was Addie Baker, and strangely enough, she is not the first to disappear in Looninville. For Lesley Jacobson, now a private phenomenon investigator, Addie Baker was her best friend and neighbor growing up. Twenty-eight-years later, Lesley is still haunted by the night Addie disappeared, as she was the only one to witness it, or was she?<br/><br/>Deciding to combine her personal and professional life, Lesley returns to Looninville to close the mystery and move forward in life with her daughter. Lacking to find any concrete evidence or input from the skittish locals, Lesley returns to the one place that appears to be at the center of these strange occurrences, a cave. The uneasy problem with this, is that Lesley does not remember there ever being a cave at all.<br/><br/>Cave of Illusions is a psychological, atmospheric horror game that will have you questioning every step taken as the reality around you will begin to shift. Things are not always as they seem, even when witnessed with the naked eye, and one must pursue the constant battle of the mind with remembering what you think you know and understanding what you actually know. How long can one wear the mask of sanity?</p>\n<p>#horror</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:29:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27c/27c26535a9330ffc44a649771434f66a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vidas Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
