Break through the cute, charming aesthetic to find its sinister undertones. Seraphim was built with a religious fervour for player feel. That means the jump is fine-tuned, the run is tight, and the wings should feel like an extension of your thoughts. Just a warning: this is a DIFFICULT game for platforming veterans! Know what you're getting into!<br/><br/><br/>Master the tricks and the tech in a judgment-free zone. Or, turn on \"mock me\" mode to be insulted when you mess up! Tame your wings and learn to manoeuvre around traps, steel yourself against brambles, dodge and weave around sinister bosses.<br/><br/> <br/>They're sinister. But also the perfect level of cute so you feel bad about hurting them.<br/><br/> <br/><ul><li>Forty plus unique, hand-crafted levels<br/></li><li>An accessible yet engaging narrative<br/></li><li>Five core areas<br/></li><li>Secrets and extras (hunt for them if you dare!)<br/></li><li>A willingness to sacrifice all my artistic principles for a funny joke <br/></li><li>A bona fide title screen (that's right)<br/></li><li>An extensive soundtrack to get your blood pumping<br/></li><li>Many, many spikes and brambles and explosions and occasionally pits<br/></li><li>Skeletons<br/></li><li>Closets<br/></li><li>Skeletons in closets<br/></li><li>A real pause menu for you pro gamers<br/></li><li>Configurable settings<br/></li><li>A writer who doesn't know how to end a list<br/></li><li>Compromising poses<br/></li><li>And more!</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-19T03:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46b/46b03e0cc9e5bd0da1821ea4cf6f1723.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 484, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valkyrie Studios", "Luke Rayfield"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["His-Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
