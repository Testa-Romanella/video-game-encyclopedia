There is clearly something weird going on, and it is up to you to try and figure it out. Head into Yarakrish Village and investigate to see if you can find the root of the weirdness!</p>\n<p>This project is intended to showcase my ability to create an immersive town with questing and cinematic dialogue that includes player choices. While there is definitely still work to be done, mostly in terms of visuals, the groundwork has been completed. All the quests are completable, and it is possible to finish the experience.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move</p>\n<p>Press J to open your journal</p>\n<p>Click on dialogue options to tell your character what to say</p>\n<p>Press Spacebar to interact with people and objects</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/szegvari/sounds/581635/</p>\n<p>Paper Scrawling sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/jackyyang09/sounds/476840/</p>\n<p>Pick up item sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/SilverIllusionist/sounds/411177/</p>\n<p>Medieval Village:\u00a0\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/detailed-medieval-...</p>\n<p>Wells:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/detailed-medieval-...</p>\n<p>Gallows: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/the-gallows-160148</p>\n<p>Barrows and Wagons:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/medieval-barrows-...</p>\n<p>Animations and characters are from\u00a0https://www.mixamo.com/#/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T08:22:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01a72b4cf73cbb408a7c07777cdd797a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SebP"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
