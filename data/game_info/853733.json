It's also the first game that I have finished.\u00a0 It's a simple endless platformer where you use a rocket launcher to launch yourself from platform to platform and also to break blocks. You have to avoid the rising fire and go for a high score. It's not perfect, but I am pretty happy with it considering this is both my first time participating in a game jam and my first time making a finished product with unity.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>A&amp;D -- Move Left &amp; Right\u00a0</p>\n<p>Space -- Jump</p>\n<p>\r\nLMB -- Shoot Rocket\u00a0</p>\n<p>How To Play:\r\nShoot rockets at your feet to launch yourself upward to reach\r\nother platforms. Shoot blocks that are in your way. Try to see\r\nhow far you can get without touching the rising fire.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Assets by: drews128 (that's me)</p>\n<p>Music by: Retro Indie Josh</p>\n<p>Sounds by: zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T13:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fa/7fa0071179dbfac7cca0c744ca5b0218.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["drews128"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
