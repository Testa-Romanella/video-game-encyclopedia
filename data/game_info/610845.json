Build a crew and take on missions but with each mission you must decide whether to fill your food storage, fuel tanks, or take in that precious gold for ship upgrades! But beware, neither your crew (or yourself) will survive without food and a ship without fuel barely moves.<br/><br/>Can you find the balance between your crew and ship? How many days can you survive out in the black while exploring the universe?<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T06:08:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aae/aae4ca4061e0891fe6f3a3d37cf8072e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fat Pirate Cat Designs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
