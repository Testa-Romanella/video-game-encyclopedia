You play as a failed experiment that is biologically attached to his gun. This means whenever you run out of HP or Ammo you will <strong>DIE</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Gunlock </em>features multiple enemy types that reacted uniquely with certain ammo types. This forces fast-paced ammo management and decision-making.\u00a0 You will need to conserve your ammo, not only because it keeps you alive, but also because it will be necessary to defeat your final foe.</p>\n<p>Devs</p>\n<p><em>Gunlock </em>was made by two high school students as their first-ever game!
