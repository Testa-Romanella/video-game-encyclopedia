This game is a typical bullet hell with 3 levels of difficulty. There is also a 4th level but I didn't have time to finish it. Like any other bullet hell, you have to shoot down the enemy while dodging a bunch of bullets\u00a0.\u00a0 While playing, you will sometimes notice that some bullets touched you but it didn't damage you and that's because I made the player's hitbox really small or the game would be wayyy to hard. If you can't figure how the controls work, I added a special menu that tells you how the work.</p>\n<p>Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:46:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/5323d2054f76e6c4b7473f683ff42d2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ElectrikFire74"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
