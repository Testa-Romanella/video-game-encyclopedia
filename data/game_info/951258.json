We're finally releasing a demo level of\u00a0our most awaited project, Space Soviets!</p>\n<p><strong>How the release came to be?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>While I did say that I would start PC Engine development for the most part, people kept peste... I mean asking me about Space Soviets, and rightfully so. But since I really wanted to work on PC Engine games, I was faced with quite the dilemma.</p>\n<p>But I found a compromise!</p>\n<p>The test level is going to be based on PC Engine classics! Even though it runs on the NES, I decided to pay tribute to the PC Engine with that ROM, while keeping the Space Soviets spirit intact. It's a bit of a mess, but I think you'll love it.</p>\n<p>(I gotta run now, but I'll update the page with some screenshots later :D:D:D )</p>\n<p>The ROM is available below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming, Graphics: Antoine Fantys - Music: Myles Davidson</p>\n<p>(C) FG Software, 2023</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T20:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e587a66f123a9783991135504f40af1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vectrex28"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
