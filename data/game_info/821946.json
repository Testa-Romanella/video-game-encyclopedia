Each time you touch a block, the number on its face decreases; when you touch a block with a 1 face, it gets destroyed. Each floor of the building rolls a die to determine the starting face of all its blocks, as well as how many keys are required to open its locks leading to the next floor. The game is over when you fall below the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>This was created for GMTK Game Jam 2022. It has very simple graphics and no sound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:29:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b0/0b00255ace27644629ccc68f1fdfde6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SteveReen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
