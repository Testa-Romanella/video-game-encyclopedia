Here's a short case, ready to play RIGHT NOW.</p>\n<p>Get the short rules, which are also for pay what you want, and get the party started.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sunday, July 4, 1982. Three men and two women play poker on the 85th floor of the Sears Tower in Chicago. They are a pair of watchmen, two policemen and an analyst who are unaware of the disaster that is coming their way - or below them. They think they'll be able to go home this afternoon and enjoy the family, but fate has other plans. Full of Aces is a short adventure for Special Agency, prepared for the participation of between two and six players. It is especially suited for novice players, and, yes, it mimics classics like Die Hard. It is an adventure -a Case- for Special Agency, designed for four or five Agents to face a large and organized group of thieves in the style of the 80's action movies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T11:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a0f78699dc5f9e20aab2a642fa19557.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juancho Duma"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
