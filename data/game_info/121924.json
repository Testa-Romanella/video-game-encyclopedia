Two assigned themes served as inspiration for the developers: Strangers in Their Own Land and The People of Eight Seasons.</p>\n<p>Using a leap motion controller and an acceleration pedal, the game allows the player to control a willow ptarmigan (<em>riekko</em>) \u2013 a bird native to Northern Europe. By flying through the Sami land and collecting food, the player experiences the environment\u2019s transition throughout the eight seasons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it is not only the nature that changes with time. Each season represents more human interference and challenges the bird has to adapt to. Trees are being cut down, new buildings rise, taking up the bird\u2019s space and applying new rules to its natural habitat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if the bird doesn\u2019t belong in its own homeland.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team Members</strong><br/>Asla Guttorm - Effects<br/>Elie Abraham - Audio<br/>Leevi Halonen - Audio, Pedal controller<br/>Magoda Wegiel - 3D Art<br/>Nig\u00e1 Aikio - Narrative, Voice acting and Level Design<br/>Samuli J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen - Producer and Coder<br/>Sofi Kurtti - 3D Art and Animation<br/>Zuzanna Buchowska - Narrative and 3D Art<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/538/53805f8f61de56107ecaedb08ae7126b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zhamul"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
