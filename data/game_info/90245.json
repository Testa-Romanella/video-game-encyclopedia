Make a bloody mess by bashing your friends into rocks, to be the last goat standing!</p>\n<strong>The Game</strong>\n<p>In some beautiful mountains somewhere, a group of goats live peacefully with one another, sharing the luscious grassy hillsides and all the food and comfort it brings\u2026 Nah, just kidding.<strong> Super Bash Goats</strong> is the real goaty deal, and there can only be one king of the mountain that gets to graze the green grass!</p>\n<p>In Super Bash Goats, you and up to three friends can play together in a fast-paced local multiplayer brawler with one single special mechanic \u2013 <strong>bashing</strong>.</p>\n<p>The bash works in a simple way, charge it by holding down the X button, aim with the left-stick and then bash into your friend, hopefully launching them into rocks and effectively slaughtering them. Each player has 5 lives to spare, and the winner is simply the last goat standing. With a beautiful setting, cute goats\u2026 and bloody chunks and gore, Super Bash Goats mixes everything that a party game should have. Grab your friends, some controllers, a PC and start bashing!</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>No keyboard support! Gamepads required! (2-4 Player)\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The game is<strong> PC only</strong> but each player needs a <strong>controller</strong> to be able to play. We have tested the game with Xbox 360/One and PS4-controllers ( ds4windows ), but it's possible that the game works with other controllers too.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Move &amp; Aim:</strong> </em>Left stick<br/><em><strong>Bash:</strong> </em>X (Hold to charge)<br/><em><strong>Jump:</strong> </em>A<br/><em><strong>Pause Game:</strong> </em>Start</p>\n<strong>The Team<br/></strong>\n<p><strong>3D Artists:<br/></strong>Ludwig Lindst\u00e5l | Paul O'Brien | Anna Asker | Laura Lohikoski</p>\n<p><strong>Designers:<br/></strong>Johan Holm\u00e9r |\u00a0Kim Sj\u00f6berg |\u00a0Nora Silow | Mario Strand</p>\n<p><strong>Music:<br/></strong>Samuel Dangoor Ehnberg</p>\n<p><strong>Sound:<br/></strong>Christopher Mauricci</p>\n<p>Initially Super Bash Goats was part of a school project and we\u00a0have since then been developing the game in our spare time alongside our studies.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Samuel Dangoor Ehnberg and Christopher Mauricci for helping out with the music and sound effects!</p>\n<p>Like us on Facebook<br/></p>\n<p>Please don't hesitate to leave a comment telling us what you think of the game.
