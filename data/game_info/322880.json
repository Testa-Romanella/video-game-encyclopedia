{"id": 322880, "slug": "snakegame-androidlovervedant", "name": "SnakeGame (AndroidLoverVedant)", "name_original": "SnakeGame (AndroidLoverVedant)", "description": "<p><em><strong>Snake</strong></em>\u00a0is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976\u00a0arcade game\u00a0<em>Blockade</em>, and the ease of implementing\u00a0<em>Snake\u00a0</em>has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word\u00a0<em>snake</em>\u00a0or\u00a0<em>worm</em>\u00a0in the title) for many platforms. After a variant was preloaded on\u00a0Nokia\u00a0mobile phones\u00a0in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience. There are over 300\u00a0<em>Snake</em>-like games for\u00a0iOS\u00a0alone.</p>\n<p>The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:53:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4b/f4bb287fef04a39a9c4d3da4526d425f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["AndroidLoverVedant"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
