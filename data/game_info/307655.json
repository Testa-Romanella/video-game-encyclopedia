{"id": 307655, "slug": "scrap-arms", "name": "Scrap Arms", "name_original": "Scrap Arms", "description": "<p>Scrap Arms is a Roguelike RPG, inspired by\u00a0<em>Mystery Dungeon\u00a0</em>(a series of roguelikes by\u00a0<em>Spike Chunsoft</em>). It combines the randomization, grid and turn-based gameplay of traditional roguelikes together with story-driven worlds of RPGs. With a story of personal themes of home, family and the obsession for the unobtainable, and deep characters with complex emotions and motivations, I hope you will be sucked into the caves of Scrap Arms.\r\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play as Ayo and Karin, new budding Scavengers, as they journey through the caves, collecting scraps along the way and helping solve the problems of their fellow townsfolk of Reeds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information \u00a0on the characters and world of Scrap Arms, I highly recommend checking out the website.</p>\n\n<p>The caves are littered with Scraps, random and seemingly commonplace items that have great use in the caves of Scrap Arms.</p>\n<p>Though learning or talent, any person is capable of bringing out the potential in different scraps, abilities particular to that scrap. Scavengers have learned to armatize the scraps to help them tackle the challenges of the caves.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Don't miss out on freebies, giveaways and competitions!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also I want to hang out with you and get to know the people looking forward to this game. I want to know what you want from Scrap Arms.</p>\n<p>Website:\u00a0www.ernestplacido.com/scraparms</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/wGk7tFG</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0www.twitter.com/scraparms\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0www.twitter.com/bigbosserndog</p>\n<p>Facebook:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0www.facebook.com/scraparms</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0www.facebook.com/bigbosserndog</p>\n\n<p>The Scrap Arms Kickstarter Campaign is launching April 30th, 2019.<br/>The reason I am looking for funding is that I am due to graduate from a Bachelors in Computer Science in 2020, when I graduate I want to have secured a means for me to continue doing what I love full time: that being indie game development.<br/><br/>I have various kickstarter rewards for backers that will not be made available after the campaign, so grab them while the campaign lasts!<br/></p>\n<p>For more information, please check out the website!</p>\n\n<p>You can now play the demo!
