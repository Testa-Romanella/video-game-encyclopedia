You must communicate well to\u00a0navigate the map eliminating the rotten flesh chasing you.\u00a0 The more rounds you survive the harder it gets,\u00a0 which is ideal\u00a0for some\u00a0relationship-ending moments.</p>\r\nInfo :\r\n<p>This is an LTT-themed Top-Down Zombie Survival Shooter made in 48hrs during Ryan Laley's Spring Jam. Well,\u00a0 from the quirky theme of the game to my chair breaking during the creation there is a lot to unpack so why don't you go and see yourself by downloading it, id really appreciate it!</p>\n<p>It's a\u00a0Co-Op game but I had as much fun\u00a0making it and playing it by myself as I would have with friends.\u00a0 So if you're like me and also don't have\u00a0friends you can still have fun even tho I consider you my friend for downloading.</p>\r\nControls :\r\n<p>WASD or Left Stick From Player 1 Movement</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys or Right Stick For Player 2 Movement</p>\n<p>Spacebar or Right Trigger To Fire Weapon</p>\n\n<p>If you gave my game a chance I would love to hear your feedback.</p>\n<p>Thank You, E-VOL-V!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T17:45:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e521299cc8e24c21cf630cc41377f7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["E-VOL-V"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
