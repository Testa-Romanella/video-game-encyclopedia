I thought creating a solo game 'mod' of it would be a fun small project to do for this JAM. The theme fit the Duel Dice brand a little too well. Even though I was working with my past game project that had a lot of polish in it, I ripped most of it out to make this teaser. So here it is!</p>\n<p>To play:<br/>Enter your name.<br/>Customize your dice in the Fate Shop.<br/>Drag 3 dice onto the board.<br/>Drag dice into the vortex to re-roll.</p>\n<p>The demon takes 10% or 3 Fate every round.<br/>The demon will also offer you pacts to help you out.<br/>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T05:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/221b8ce33a152883ce792ba75c8e79ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flowG"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
