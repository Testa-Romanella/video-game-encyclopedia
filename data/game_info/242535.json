Simply tilt your device left or right to roll the ball. Tapping on the top section of the screen will cause the ball to propel upwards; tapping the bottom section will make the ball fall faster. Up or down propulsion will cause the ball to shrink so be careful! Shrink the ball too much and its game over!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6b44c5a65a653e67fcfe9b05667be47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ashley Sherwin"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ashley Sherwin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
