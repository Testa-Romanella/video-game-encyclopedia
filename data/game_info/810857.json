These modifications will allow you to customize the style of movement of your robot.</p>\n<p>It's up to you to find the right synergies between the modules, and to establish your strategies for each race.</p>\n\n\n<p>To realize this project, I was strongly inspired by several games that I enjoyed:</p>\n<p>-TrackMania</p>\n<p>-Titanfall</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm the only developer and I don't have enough modeling, graphics and sound skills to finish this project.</p>\n<p>But the gameplay was on my mind, and I needed an excuse to work on my code for 3D in Unity, so there it is.</p>\n<p>If you like the game, don't hesitate to leave a comment. It will motivate me to finish my todo list.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T18:16:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05b/05b41a9e8af73e2a04fd4ed613d4a4fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Th\u00e9o Leicht", "Elowe"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
