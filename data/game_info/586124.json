Protected by a glass dome, Endeavor rises above the once lively area and worker robots are trying their best to keep it going. In order to maintain it, every robot has to do its job perfectly and any imperfections found are being discarded.<br/><br/>Thrown to a junkyard for a malfunction, a single robot worker is on a quest to get itself fixed. But the city sees this loyal worker as a threat now, so all the robots and defenses that protect Endeavor have turned against their former colleague. With the unique ability to control various machines of the city, including any robots that are in the way, this little Robot is on a mission to fix himself and find intelligent life.<br/><br/>Yet it seems that there is no intelligent life left. Only the robots programmed to keep the city nice and clean for people who are nowhere to be found.<br/><br/><br/><h3>You are on your own</h3>Long ago humans vanished leaving behind only their robotic creations. Now the world they left behind is falling apart. Is there anyone out there to help you fix it and discover what happened to the people who used to live here?<br/><br/><br/><h3>Your enemies are your tools</h3>Alone in the world, the little robot has a special trick up his sleeve: the ability to hack and gain control of any other machines.
