Recently, she made two important realizations about herself. One: she's deeply in love with her adventurous best friend, <strong>Allison Goleta</strong>. (The feeling was mutual.) And two: if Allison has her heart set on becoming an adventurer, then maybe Melody could join her. As a healer.</p>\n\n<p>It all seemed perfect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0And then things got weird.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Super Lesbian Animal RPG </strong>is a short but sweet game about love, anxiety, and fighting funny looking monsters in\u00a0dungeons. It follows the stories of Melody, her new girlfriend Allison, and their friends <strong>Claire</strong> (a sarcastic, rule-bending witch) (she is also trans) and <strong>Jodie</strong> (a dependable, somewhat motherly knight).\u00a0This early pay-what-you-want demo gives players a taste of what's to come in the full game.</p>\n<p>Any donations will go towards funding the final game - in\u00a0other words,\u00a0paying my rent. Development is also funded via Patreon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DEMO FEATURES:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Explore Greenridge as Melody and meet some of the town's colorful inhabitants!</li><li>Tackle the game's first dungeon!
