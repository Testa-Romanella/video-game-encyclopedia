The penguins depend on you to collect the wood and deliver it to them. Keep the fire running.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are three levels in the game. You have 5 minutes to complete the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Known issues and bugs: Timer does not reset once it runs out. For this, quit the app and start again to retry. Hope you enjoy the game.
