We see games as potential carriers of great art like any other creative medium. <br/><br/>We have tried to match our words with actions by shunning traditional \u201cgame\u201d traps like genres, graphic styles, or mechanics, while seeking out games that make us lean in. That make us feel something. We see games as vehicles for a greater message, than purely entertainment.<h3>SO WHAT?</h3>Art is never so important as during difficult times.<br/><br/>Art allows us to escape, to seek meaning, and to give a universal voice to our inner thoughts.<br/><br/>On top of interpreting our collective past and present, art carries our hopes, dreams, fears, and wishes for a better future. Due to this transcendent quality games have never been more important than during this hellscape of a year. We have seen this in the messages people have sent us and in the titles submitted to us.<br/><br/>It's time for us at Raw Fury to take the next step, to stand behind our convictions. We've opened two game-focused art galleries \u2014 One in Stockholm, Sweden and the other in Zagreb, Croatia. As the bases of operations, these two cities will be the hub in which we begin to prove \u201cgames as art\u201d to the world. In addition, we're launching this virtual gallery to give folks from across the globe a chance to see what can happen when you bring a bunch of artists together in creating works inspired by video games.<br/><br/>Welcome to the virtual gallery.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T02:41:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/452/4525cc6eca19b75fc7335d2688dcbae8.jpg", "website": "http://www.artoffury.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 108, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Raw Fury"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Raw Fury"], "esrb_rating": null}
