Made over 7 days for <em>Brackey's Game Jam 2023.1</em> with the theme of <em>\"An End is a New Beginning,\"</em> our submission offers a unique twist on the traditional platformer genre.\r\n</p>\n<p>As the player navigates through each puzzle, they must <strong>cross into the spirit realm</strong> to continue their journey. Each time they do, they are transformed into a soul, and a new living player spawns. The player must control both their living and soul forms to progress, creating for some truly puzzling experiences.\r\n</p>\n<p>But be warned, <strong>crossing into the spirit realm comes with its own set of challenges</strong>. Once there, crossing back over results in an untimely death, leaving behind a poor, dead body. Perhaps you can use this new morbid leverage to your advantage!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you to everyone on the team who worked on this project!</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Game Design:</strong> 4dsurvivor</li><li><strong>Programming:</strong> Dooshort, 4dsurvivor, Zach @ Homehearth</li><li><strong>Art:</strong> Zach @ Homehearth</li><li><strong>Music/SFX:</strong> Will Harder</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Where to find us:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4dsurvivor</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Itchio:\u00a0https://4dsurvivor.itch.io</li><li>Twitter: https://twitter.com/4dsurvivor</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Dooshort</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Itchio:\u00a0https://dooshort.itch.io</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Zach @ Homehearth</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Itchio:\u00a0https://homehearth.itch.io</li><li>Twitter: https://twitter.com/homehearthgames</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Will Harder</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Itchio: https://will-harder.itch.io</li><li>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Will202X</li><li>Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/willharder</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T10:50:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2f/e2fd99045cd3e63f3cf127d9af40a42d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Homehearth", "4dsurvivor", "Will Harder", "Dooshort"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
