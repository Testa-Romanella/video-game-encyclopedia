It has no features or mechanics that regular games may have and is practically an operating system in a game. I hope you enjoy the experience regardless of the game's simplicity. </strong><h3>INTRODUCING doorOS</h3>Who needs Windows anymore? It's not like y'all don't have the curtains shut all the time. doorOS has built in apps such as \"Tweeter\", \"Grammer\" &amp; \"doorOSledge\" to name a few, for you to use while on the computer. It comes with beautifully animated app icons for you to click on in style. You may have thoughts along the lines of: \"Why would I upgrade?\". Well you see, it's a <strong> stylish </strong> downgrade, yeah. <strong>*NOTE: The launch screen has a 99% success rate.</strong> (There's no actual operating system included with the game.) <h3>PLAY AS A VIRUS</h3>Remember doorOS being a downgrade? Yeah... the anti-virus sucks. Play as a virus on an unfortunate NEETs <strong>(Not in Education, Employment, or Training)</strong> computer, who's been on too many sketchy sites... Become the first virus anyone would actually want to have, by making <strong>his</strong> life easier, the hard way, for <strong>his</strong> own good &amp; unveil secrets <strong>he's</strong> trying to hide from the public, by solving puzzles in- and outside of the game.<h3>DISTRACTIONS</h3>Just like in real life, you'll have to deal with distractions that prevent you from doing actual important &amp; productive stuff, like achieving your goals. Friends who keep messaging you to play games? A Tweeter thread full of toxic people? A Grammer artist you're envious off? Or of course, yourself. What are the goals you ask? I don't know, either. The built-in operating system \"doorOS\" does not come with a \"goals\" feature. (Again, there's no actual operating system included with the game pls don't sue me.) <br/><br/><strong>*NOTE: The game has swear words, as long as you're cool with that, you're good. If you aren't, uhhhhhhh... idk give it a try it's regardless it's not that bad lol</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T03:40:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0d/e0d418ac850d3b2ee9c271e4a2d8e40c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BerCh1n"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BerCh1n"], "esrb_rating": null}
