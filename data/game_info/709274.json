It is purely a puzzle game.\u00a0You can move in the orthogonal directions, upon which all movable blocks move as far as they can go in that direction. Collect all the collectibles to win the level.<br/></p>\n<p>I assumed that I had already played such a game, as that would be how it entered my mind, but neither of us could identify it. I considered I could create this game myself, though I didn't want to exactly rip off an existent game.\u00a0I created this prototype so that I may ask the community about this. Please let me know if you know of the game I am trying to think of, or for any other feedback.</p>\n<p>-Madeline Kahn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T05:20:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab4/ab4c6a8bfc8585491b7659801cc1004b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Okay Then Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
