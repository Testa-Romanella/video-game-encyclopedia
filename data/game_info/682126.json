{"id": 682126, "slug": "love-save-robot", "name": "Love save & robot", "name_original": "Love save & robot", "description": "<p>In a wilderness forest, there is a science lab that has been abandoned by people. Inside lives Natalya, a mechanical girl, and her pet cat Pudding, a cat she saved with her body's energy in a junkyard, and their fates have been bound together ever since. One day when Natalya was out looking for ingredients, her body malfunctioned and her energy was depleted by a small explosion. The only way to revive Natalya is to collect the corresponding energy source and put it back into her body. Natalya and Pudding are the only ones who depend on this deserted world, not only are their fates one, their lives are also one. They can not lose each other, Natalya gave Pudding a chance to live again, Pudding will also use its own ability to wake up Natalya at this time.\r\n </p>\n<p>Pudding needs to collect the corresponding energy source in each room within a limited time, and there will be different challenges waiting for Pudding in each room, it needs to use its wisdom and bravery to solve the challenges and collect all the energy sources. This is the only way to save Natalya.\r\n</p><p>You can control Pudding and collect energy. Press \"E\" can conversate with NPC and \"Return\" can go next conversation. Press\" E\" to open the Cabinet and Press\" L\" to open the lights. You can move a chair or something else and pick up a book to help you jump higher place.</p>\n<p>Development Devlog:</p><p>We changed our story concept again and again. At first, we think that someone became smaller and try to save oneself. We think that the story is not very meaningful. We decided to add more element into our background story. We learned a lot things from this project. We learn how to make animation and write a code to trigger the animation. We also learned how to open and close\u00a0the lights.\u00a0</p><p>Playtesting feedback:</p><p>At first, we set the time as 3mins. Everyone in our group needs to play once. We found that no one can finish the game within 3mins. Then, I did a little bit change. We changed the time as 5 mins. \u00a0We have to make sure that the time is not too longer so that the game is too simple. \u00a0After several playtesting, we found the tims is just enough. \u00a0I changed the energy ball position over and over again in order to make sure player can collect them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Success:\r\n </p>\n<p>Love save&amp; robot has a game concept that is to save the friend. We give the game a background story and make the tasks meaningful. Moreover, we try to make a dialogue system that the player can talk to NPC in order to understand the task. We design physical interaction: pick up an object, open the door, collect energy ball, open the light, move the object.\u00a0 The Pudding is too small to collect an energy ball.\u00a0 The player should move the chair or something else to jump to the desk. We give the player a free space so that player can move anything to help them collect the energy ball.\r\n </p>\n<p>Failures:\r\n </p>\n<p>The music is a problem. We design a collecting sound but the sound is too low. We do not know how to control the volume. The background music also has a problem. I have not fixed it up yet.\u00a0 When the player collects all the energy ball in room one, the player enters room 2. When the player comes back to room one, the energy ball shows up again. We do not know the reason. That should be a bug in the game.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Lessons Learned:\r\n </p>\n<p>In the project, I learn how to collaborate with other people in Unity. Group work is totally different from individual work.\u00a0 We should divide the works and assign it to everyone. At first, everyone makes one scene. We found that the code script is almost the same in every room. If everyone makes one scene, we will do the same work repeatedly. Thus, someone made a 3D model and someone write interactive code. This division makes us finish this game very quickly.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Future development:\r\n </p>\n<p>I think that we could make climbing action. I think we should fix these problems in the future. We should learn animation and animated the girl. In the end, we could make the girl stand up.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T07:01:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e3/4e30d3d9960329cc23b5fe12c0860c9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["tarahu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
