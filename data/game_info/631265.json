After their victory, the nobles crowned the King in the Capital's Castle Temple, and for a time thereafter the kingdom enjoyed the peace and prosperity of a state guided by consensus and natural justice.</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Eventually, however, the strain of his nobles' competing interests took their toll on the King. He spent more time in retreat and less time with his advisors. On an otherwise ordinary day, the King went into the Temple to meditate, and has not been seen since. His Chancellor, Lord Pompton, has been his only contact with the outside world, and all but rules in the King's stead. The other nobles are gravely concerned, and the kingdom now teeters on the brink of dissolution...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You, the Destinarian, are the kingdom's best hope for securing the throne once again for the King and his loyal subjects. Travel throughout the counties of the kingdom to liberate their captive nobles and build a coalition to defeat\u00a0Lord Pompton. With the help of Laura Beckett and your allies in the Castle, you may yet\u00a0fulfill your destiny...</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Compatible with most 4-button, 2-knob gamepad controllers.
