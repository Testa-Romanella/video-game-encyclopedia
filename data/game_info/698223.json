Simply aim your line, fire and cleanup the seas! As you collect more trash you'll gain experience points which can be used to upgrade your line or boat!</p>\n<p>The game was made in just under a week, and a full video of the process can be found\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>The game is free to download and play, however any\u00a0donations made will go directly to TeamSeas!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! If you enjoyed it, be sure to spread the word by sharing the game, or video above with family &amp; friends!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:44:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94e/94e6728ad19191063d64887588c74501.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skatanic Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
