He is a solitary spider\r\n  in a woodland full of surprises. What does Charlie do all day? Why is he\r\n  always exploring? Maybe to find a mate? No, Charlie has no time for that!\r\n  Charlie is always hungry looking for something good to eat. Every day he sets\r\n  up some webs near his home to catch some unsuspecting bugs. While he is out,\r\n  Charlie loves to gather shiny coins. How did these get in the forest? Nobody\r\n  knows. All Charlie knows is that they will look rather lovely in his Study,\r\n  next to his collection of sea shells. We join Charlie as he sets out on a run\r\n  to check those webs...\r\n</p>\r\nCharacters\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Charlie\r\n      Harold\r\n      Roxxy\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nObject of the Game\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    Try to collect as many \"BUG\" coins as you can to increase your score. Your\r\n    score also increases the longer Charlie survives.\r\n  </li>\n<li>\r\n    You will encounter some obstacles along the way too. Watch out for that\r\n    birb, Harold! He is a tricky one! You will have to jump over that pesky\r\n    Roxxy as well.\r\n  </li>\n<li>\r\n    In a bind? Don't worry, those obstacles can be blasted for some extra\r\n    points! Be careful though, you only have 5 shots. Eat more bugs caught in\r\n    webs to get back some health and refill your shots!\r\n  </li>\n<li>\r\n    Challenge your friends to survive the longest, collect the most coins and\r\n    get the highest score!\r\n  </li>\n</ul>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      Jump\r\n      Attack\r\n      Pause\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Keyboard\r\n      Space, Up Arrow\r\n      Z, Mouse Click\r\n      ESC\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Xbox\r\n      A, Y\r\n      B, X\r\n      Start\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Mobile\r\n      \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCreators\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Chris Racioppo\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Goose\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThird Party Licenses\r\n<p>\r\n  Third Party License information can be found in the\r\n  LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY\r\n  file\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:57:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e59/e593fc693655ae022a25bc5bcd7c02db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gravedigger7789"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
