As each level progresses, the difficulty increases. Watch out for cougars!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Collect Food</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A variety diet is a great diet for a bear such as yourself. So there are many types of food to collect in game, such as berries, apples, fish, sticks and even squirrels! Some food is readily able to be picked up however others need an extra bit of effort - press space and you will be able to hunt/fish!</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid Enemies</strong></p>\n<p>Just like in real life, your grizzly will need to avoid conflict with enemies such as cougars! You can either dodge them as they guard their territory, or attack using the space key - the choice is yours</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T15:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bc1f2da3033308b16296f8df4757598.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sean Collier"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
