With this game, I set out to not only fulfil said ambitions, only in colour of course, but also to address just about every issue anyone had with the original version!</p>\n<p>This colour remaster includes:<br/>- New Stages<br/>- New Enemies and Hazards<br/>- New Songs and Sound Effects<br/>- Boss Battles<br/>- An ending cutscene</p>\n<p><em>I'm also including a downloadable Windows 32 version if anybody would prefer that over the browser version.</em></p>\n<p>I made sure to stick to the specs of the GBC as accurately as I possibly could, only one BG layer (plus the Window layer, but that's just the HUD) only 3 colours per sprite/background tile, 7-ish palettes of 3 colours + transparency each (not really sure if the GBC has 7 or 8 palettes per layer, the info I got on that was conflicting, so\u00a0I mostly just stuck with 7 palettes just to be safe, if anything, I could just do a scanline interrupt at the HUD on real hardware and it'd still look identical)</p>\n<p>I could not simulate the sprite limits, either total or per-scanline, but\u00a0I've been rather conservative with my sprite usage to begin with, aside from layering sprites with different palettes to get more colours for the protagonist, but even then, that shouldn't really be an issue even in real hardware.\u00a0I tried to make my sprites as narrow as possible,\u00a0I\u00a0thought the GBC could handle up to 64 sprites on-screen, like the\u00a0NES and the\u00a0PC engine, but partway through development I found out it can only do 40,\u00a0needless to say I was rather disappointed, but I\u00a0can work with it, I did a lot of flickering on minor sprites in order to minimise sprite usage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any and all parallax scrolling was made using one or more of the following tricks:<br/>- Animating tiles when the camera moves<br/>- Splitting the BG layer horizontally\u00a0and moving the different parts at different speeds<br/>- Rendering sprites as BG objects (usually behind the BG)<br/>(Note, I\u00a0didn't just make extra layers in-engine to simulate these tricks, I actually did them)</p>\n<p>As for the sound and music, I tried my best to stick to the 4 sound channel limitation, I've made all songs and sound effects in\u00a0Deflemask using the Game Boy soundchip, which means that they are all playable in real hardware, but as for playing them in-game,\u00a0I've recorded channels 1\u00a0(Pulse) and 3 (Wave) in their own file, as they never get cut out, channel 2\u00a0(Pulse) in its own file, and channel 4 (Noise) in its own file, and whenever I need to play a Pulse-based sound effect, I mute channel 2, and when I need to play a\u00a0\u00a0Noise-based sound effect, I mute channel 4, unfortunately that means that I have 3 sound files playing simultaneously, and I have\u00a0<strong><em>no way</em></strong> of preventing any possible desyncs, I\u00a0can't even check whether they are in-sync at any point! That's just not supported by C2's\u00a0audio plugin... So in order to remedy that,\u00a0I've made sure that every time the main file loops, I also set the other two files to their loop points, but that means if the music ever goes out of sync\u00a0(which does happen) it only fixes itself when it loops, so I've made it so that you can use the backspace key to reset the song if it ever goes out-of-sync, that fixes it 90% of the time, and you can press it as many times as you want, so if it doesn't fix itself the first time, it probably will the 2nd or 3rd. This wouldn't be an issue if I could simply play the actual Game\u00a0Boy Sound files in the browser, and was also able to mute/unmute individual channels, but alas, no such plugin exists for C2, at least yet...</p>\n<p>-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-{[ S P E C I A L\u00a0\u00a0 T H A N K S\u00a0]}-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-</p>\n<p>I'd like to give my special thanks to Popfan (@gensakudan) for helping on playtesting the game, as well as helping me fix the Stage 2 theme, and also to Spoonybard13 and boomboompsh for helping on playtesting.</p>\n<p>-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-{[ L I N K S ]}-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<br/></p>\n<p>Original Soundtrack:\u00a0https://michirin9801.bandcamp.com/album/akumanor-escape-dx-ost<br/>Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYDM1BwnMlU<br/>Box art:\u00a0https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/78055891</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:37:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d38/d382e9cf250e8a68eae6af1452de801b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Michirin"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
