Therefore, when I created this game I wanted to incorporate two things that I am passionate about: healthcare and technology. This game serves as a relaxation tool. As a healthcare worker in the field of psych everyone is always looking for a way to cool down and relax. This is the final version of my game. For this final version, I\u00a0\u00a0have cleaned up all code and added clear documentation. Features that did not work previously in other versions of this game now do. I hope you enjoy the final product as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T08:57:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69a/69ad98ffb2f36b840a354d536e352774.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jeo29"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
