Some members are fit perfectly for their roles, be it slaying monsters, hosting a morning mass, farming the land, or\u00a0entertaining the public.\u00a0But some\u00a0you will find are just\u00a0decent, and they can even be\u00a0awful at their roles altogether.\u00a0 Your choices carry consequence to your rule, so decide carefully who shall undertake their roles for the kingdom.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game plays\u00a0by selecting from a randomized roll of three workers and jobs, with the player unaware who fits each job. Their workers consists of a cleric, entertainer, knight, merchant, noble, and a peasant from their kingdom. The jobs range from mundane tasks, novel situations, and oddball things that occurred or would be\u00a0done from the medieval ages.\u00a0\u00a0Players must figure out what role each worker would be best for, with the player gaining or losing their influence based on their decision.
