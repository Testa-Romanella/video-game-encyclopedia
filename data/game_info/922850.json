{"id": 922850, "slug": "arrow-ambush-adventure-take-cover", "name": "Arrow Ambush Adventure - Take Cover!", "name_original": "Arrow Ambush Adventure - Take Cover!", "description": "<p>This is a simple boss battle game.</p>\n<p>You can shoot with your Mouse, move with WASD. You can hold down the mouse longer for power shot.<br/></p>\n<p>Your arrow damage is low. Time to find another way to defeat the boss! Go from cover to cover, look always where the boss is watching currently, attack its weakpoints on the back\u00a0(blue rectangle) and on the eye (blue sphere).</p>\n<p>Beware the boss's attacks. When the boss sees your character, the eye of the boss turns yellow (as well as your character currently). You need to take cover before the eye turns red. You can hide behind the light blue rectangles (covers) or hide inside the green rectangles (bushes).\u00a0If the Boss's eye is red, it activates attack mode and shoots a rocket towards you.</p>\n<p>Use your environment!\u00a0There are some objects in the game that you can shoot and they will fall down, if they are hitting the boss they will deal massive damage! You can shoot black fields (oil field) to ignite them, the smoke will provide you temporary cover (15 s) and the fire damages both player and boss if they get in contact. Trick the boss getting closer to you and bump into the pillars to push them on the boss. You can also shoot the large brown dam in order to release water on the first and second level, dealing a massive damage to the boss.<br/></p>\n<p>Use the altars! There are some altars around the map. Going closer to the altar will activate its special arrow. Special arrows deal more damage and you can do cool things with them. Red particles are coming from the Fire altar, that gives you fire arrows, light blue -\u00a0white particles are coming from Frost altar, dark-blue particles are coming from the Water altar and yellow particles from the Lightning altar.</p>\n<p>Use Fire Arrows or your regular arrows to ignite the black oilfield.\u00a0You can then use Water\u00a0Arrows\u00a0extinguish the flames and make the oilfield activable again. You can turn the flames into Cover by shooting them with Frost Arrows. You can melt the ice into interactable oil field by shooting the frozen flames with a Fire Arrow.</p>\n<p>Use Frost Arrows on the water to freeze it so you can walk on it. Shoot the frozen water with Fire Arrow to melt it back to water. Shoot lightning arrow to the water to electrify it and increase the damage dealt by water.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T10:13:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62e/62e3a26e92e55ecd861c20f4e7babaed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LevChickie"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
