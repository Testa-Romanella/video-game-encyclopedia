School was abruptly cut\u00a0early this year because of the pandemic\u00a0so she had a lot of time and\u00a0she keeps telling me she wants to be a game developer/designer someday so I figured why not start our own passion project and take it from there. The game is \"kind of\" finished but we will be adding/revising more stuff as we move along.</p>\n<p>QUESTKEEP is FREE but we are open for donations (if you really like the game). Those who donated can also request\u00a0 a copy of the PC, Mac, iOS and Android versions too (launching soon!).</p>\n<p>We are still planning to add more stuff to the game and there could be bugs as well so please feel free to comment and send us your feedback, suggestions and bug reports. THANK YOU!</p>\n<p>HAPPY PLAYING! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T06:18:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdc/fdc17219f285daefc078f3e13b38eff9.jpg", "website": "http://www.kuyimobile.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web", "iOS"], "developers": ["Kuyi Mobile"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Erickson Garayblas"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
