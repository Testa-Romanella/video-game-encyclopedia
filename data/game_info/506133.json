However they do tend to shoot two bullets when they die.\u00a0Careful how you run and where you shoot or you'll trigger a chain reaction. Oh, and your gun is malfunctioning. Good luck!</p>\n<p>There are 2 portals you can use to escape death. One is very far away and gives a massive final score reward, the other is for cowards. Inversely if you don't want to escape you can trigger a massive chain reaction of bullets, and if you survive 600 enemies dying\u00a0without you getting hit, you win.</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Space to trigger a Bomb that removes all bullets for 3 seconds</p>\n<p>Escape or P to pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T04:47:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5fda85f9639cb5ab4a21ad49a2b76b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["BaiRado"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
