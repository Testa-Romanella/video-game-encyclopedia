You have to find 4 chests with relics of ancient technology. But be aware. It won't be easy! A lot of dangerous warriors from an old tribe are there to protect their treasures. <br/><br/>The theme of Ludum Dare 36 was \"Ancient Technology\". We were a team of two coders and one for graphics. The game was written in Haxe using HaxeFlixel and offers keyboard or game pad controls (see below). Sounds have been created using SFXR, the tile set and the animations created with aseprite. <br/><br/>The levels were created using Tiled. The world itself is created procedurally by patching different level segments together in an top-down approach. <br/>Every time you start the game, the levels will be different. Also the items are created procedurally by using a list of affixes in combination with item names. This allows an easy generation of different gameplay experiences. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/406/406cfb705c106758ef1f8844787b3d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["runvs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
