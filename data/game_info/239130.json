Camp out and snipe the enemy soldiers as they charge your bases. Each kill earns you cash which you can use to upgrade your weapon, call in support, and repair the base. You will be faced off against soldiers carrying grenades, automatic weapons, even trucks and tanks fully equipped with lots of fire power. Build fences, add soldiers to your base, throw grenades and call in air strikes. Hold your ground at each base for 10 days and you will get your chance to move to the next base. Hold off the enemy and save all your bases and you will become a national hero!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ba/0ba664aae0652ddedbde00044b602705.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Feng Li"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Feng Li"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
