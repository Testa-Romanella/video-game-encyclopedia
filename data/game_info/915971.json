Maybe a well, an old grave, or maybe you got caught in a sinkhole while walking to the corner store. Nobody is really sure, but you know you must get out. With a little help from a ghost, you just might!\u00a0Run, roll, hop, and dash your way out of the hollow!<br/></p>\n<p>This is my second published title that started as a GameDev.TV tutorial that I felt could use some extra features and polish to become a fast paced and fun game to play. I\u00a0have a book full of future ideas to add and a story for progression, but I\u00a0wanted to get a finished, albeit short, version out to gauge feedback from the public.</p>\n<p>Please leave any and all feedback so that I can become a better programmer, pixel artist, and all around game developer! If you had so much fun you just can't stand it, I humbly ask that you donate what you can. This will not only motivate me to continue learning and creating, but also give me a reason to come back and fully flesh out this title.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All credits can be viewed in game [TAB] as well as in the text file included with the download.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for choosing to spend your time on my page and playing my game!</p>\n<p><strong>Update 1/23/23\u00a0-</strong>\u00a0Fixed an issue with popping audio near green slimes. Also fixed\u00a0some spelling errors and bound roll to 'K'\u00a0as well as RMB\u00a0for my nephew. I'm working on a solution for the player occasionally\u00a0getting stuck in the wall when rolling.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T12:50:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02f7bce4ba2d45eaf8a9a1eb38bb83e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TwitchyOrphan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
