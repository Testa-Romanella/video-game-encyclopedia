It was developed in under 48 hours for Ludumdare 40. There are 10 levels to be unlocked ranging from easy to brutal-ish hard! The AI is almost-up-to-par and will try and hinder you as much as it can!</p>\n<p>There are\u00a0<strong>3 unit</strong>\u00a0types:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>The People</strong></li><li><strong>The Army</strong></li><li><strong>The Dictator</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Each unit has a strength and a weakness</strong>.\u00a0<strong>The Dictator</strong>\u00a0can control\u00a0<strong>the Army</strong>\u00a0but will be toppled by\u00a0<strong>the People</strong>.\u00a0<strong>The Army</strong>\u00a0can destroy\u00a0<strong>the People</strong>.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no tutorial but playing through the first 3 levels will teach you all you need to do. It\u2019s a bit rough around the edges but hey, 48 hours is 48 hours!\u00a0<strong>Note that the music is disabled on start-up</strong>. To hear my first attempt at Milkytracker press the \u201cMusic\u201d button in the Main Menu to toggle it on (or off).</p>\n<p>Also note that you can swap units in range of each other!</p>\n<p>Levels unlock in succession. Complete the first one to unlock the second one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c7/5c73e21dd2f45ac28f4b31c49c3a9831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bacioiu Ciprian"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
