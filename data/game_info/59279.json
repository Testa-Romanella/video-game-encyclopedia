You play the role of a spell-casting, gravity-defying warrior named Lau. Set in post-apocalyptic Asia, you must battle your way through an army of fiends to rescue a fellow warrior who has been possessed by a demon. Employ sword combat and magic attacks, combined with acrobatics, gliding, and wall-walking as you fight multiple enemies. The game incorporates the best elements of Hong Kong cinema--swords, magic spells, demons, and wirework--to create an authentic action experience.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2003-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2b5/2b5165b46ca3a0dfb879ee0f5a874709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 4, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 557, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Taito", "Red Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["505 Games", "Taito", "BAM!
