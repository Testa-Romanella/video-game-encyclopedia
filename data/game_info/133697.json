The idea is that you need to defend your city from incoming missiles. To do so, you are given three missile towers from which you can shoot missiles that explode where you want to. But beware, as you shoot, the towers will become hot and if you reach it's maximum temperature they will enter in a cooldown period in which you cannot shoot. You lose when all the cities are destroyed. If a missile tower is destroyed it will be respawned the next round\u2026 if you survive. Have fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/367/3674b9a2961548f0e252b3240a283b4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hako"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
