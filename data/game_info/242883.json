The idea is your the white square avoiding all things that approach you. You can't move out of the black center square. You win by withstanding the level and making it to the end. like a bullet hell without shooting.</p><p>I could see the game being really fun if the projectiles are deployed to music. Its like a rhythm game where you dodge the notes instead of hitting or playing them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25b/25bbc3451c0a7e9599f07b7489a8397b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thomas.kevin2225"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
