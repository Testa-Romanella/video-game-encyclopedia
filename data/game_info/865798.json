The story is told through the eyes of the young men and women of the Gallo family, who range from the ages of 11-24, as they begin to enter into a life of crime.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:\u00a0</strong>If you have yet to read the first novel in the series, \u201cCrime Opera: The Butterfly Effect\", it is highly recommended you do so before reading the following spoilers!\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>The story begins 9 years after The first Crime Opera tale. Xander Gallo is now bitter, alone, and out of control. He is causing problems for not only other families within the crime syndicate, but for the younger Gallo members as well. Those who remained behind to continue the family legacy are soon forced to take sides with or against Xander Gallo, while others who have seemingly moved on with their lives are pulled back in against their will.\r\n</p>\n<p>Crime Opera is a tale of loyalty and deceit, murder and survival, and both the strength and frailty of familial bonds. This particular novel serves as the second part of a much longer saga, following the Gallos from childhood to old age as they are pitted against the outside forces of the mafia world, and eventually, each other as well.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>As with the previous novel, this installment is divided into four books (24 chapters total). Expect many unexpected twists and turns, questionable alliances, and false setups within.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T11:09:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de37182a01d589acc4d84bdef47cb7f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Crime Opera Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
