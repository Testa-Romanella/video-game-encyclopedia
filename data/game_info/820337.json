The game is made of quite a few random elements - the level generation (even down to the textures being randomly selected and coloured), the enemy's rolls, and your own.<br/></p>\n<p>Each level increases in difficulty, as new dice emerge. As you kill each one, you obtain them in your <strong>Dice Bag</strong>. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to swap out dice from your party and the <strong>Dice Bag</strong>, or get out a new dice to replace a dead dice who died.</p>\n<p>When you roll your dice, whatever number it lands on is how far it is allowed to move, or to attack. Each of your dice has an attack range of 3 tiles - but enemy dice only have an attack range of 2 tiles - use this to your advantage!\u00a0Dice deal more damage when attacking a die next to them.</p>\n<p>Though the dice you start with is numbered 1-2-3-4-5-6, lots of the other dice aren't - and each has different health values too.<br/></p>\n<p>A quick note: We accidentally gave the dice\u00a0<em>too\u00a0</em>much personality. Sometimes they're a little mischievous and disobey their code a little. Feel free to tell us about whatever strange antics they get up to in the comments.</p>\n\n<p>Programming - LlamaDev</p>\n<p>Art and Music - OsirisMoon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T00:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/476/47684099c493da8ef9d9ea153b7abc2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["LlamaDev Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
