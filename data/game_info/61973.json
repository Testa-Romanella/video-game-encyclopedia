{"id": 61973, "slug": "slider", "name": "Slider", "name_original": "Slider", "description": "Slider is a combination puzzle that challenges a player to slide pieces along certain routes to establish a certain end-configuration.<br/>\r\nIt is a descendant of the jigsaw puzzle in that its point is to form a picture on-screen. The last square of the puzzle is then displayed automatically once the other pieces have been lined up.<br/>\r\nUnlike other tour puzzles, a sliding block puzzle prohibits lifting any piece off the board. Hence, finding moves and the paths opened up by each move within the two-dimensional confines of the board are important parts of solving sliding block puzzles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCredits:<br/>\r\nDesign: Lucid Dreaming, Medialoot<br/>\r\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e738033b8d2e3955496a98fea3f1e0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Albireo Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Albireo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
