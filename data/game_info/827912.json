Check your watch with \"E\" to make sure you aren't running out of time. But most importantly press \"Space\" to see what may be lurking behind you.\u00a0In astrophotography a normal shutter speed is 20 which makes it so that it\u00a0takes 20 seconds to take a photo.\u00a0So\u00a0make sure that you balance taking photos and checking behind you because you can't stop the camera once you have taken a photo and any bright light would mess up the photo.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse to Look</li><li>E to view Journal</li><li>Q to view Watch</li><li>Left Mouse to take a photo</li><li>Right Mouse to zoom</li><li>Space to look behind you</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Extra\u00a0Information:</strong></p>\n<p>This is my very first game which was made in a little above 2 weeks as a summer project of mine.
