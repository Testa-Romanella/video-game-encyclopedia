Cooked it up in about 4 months in Clickteam Fusion 2.5. Not sure if development on this will continue but here is what I got so far.</p>\n<p>The game is heavily influenced by cartoons, as if it wasn't obvious already.<br/>Heavily influenced by directors such as Max Fleischer, Gene Deitch, Chuck Jones and Tex Avery.<br/>Also influenced by various Japanese arcade and Sega Mega Drive, Master System and PlayStation games!<br/><br/>The game is, cartoony. Very. It is quite literally Hanna Barbera stock sounds galore.<br/></p>\n<p>Our protagonist, Poppi Popcat, has found out an evil company under the name of \"Mousy Corporation\" is operating a robot whose function is to destroy every cartoon and erase Saturday Mornings from existence! It specifically targets Poppi's city. He sure as heck will not let this happen and takes proper action!<br/><br/>But will the bad guys from the Mousy Corporation let him do it? Well, he does not have any powerful weapons. He does not have a sword or a machine gun, but what he does have is a Yo-yo that hits harder than a sailor's fist after eating a whole can of spinach!<br/><br/>In case this actually finishes development, See you soon! Criticism is appreciated.<br/><br/>(NOTE: I was gonna have this done by SAGE 2022 but i slowed down too much because of life, oops.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T07:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c8ade6d182f8f08d399acb4a0a0cbc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheDevWithNoName"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
