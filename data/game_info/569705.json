If you can't move BUT can look around, Refresh webpage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a quick mockup of what I want to put in the VR space for learning how to do a pre trip inspection to get a class A CDL license. You usually don't have a semitruck at your disposal unless you know someone or you pay a couple grand to go to school to use their truck. This is meant to be a useful learning tool you can use at anytime.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe red dots on the ground will be \"teleport\" points when I implement VR mode.\r\nI'm converting this into VR so it can be a more immersive experience for the visual learners out there.\u00a0\u00a0I may make a regular 3d version and a mobile app version of this but VR is my ultimate goal. Again this is just something I put together after learning how to use Unity a few days ago. I now need to\u00a0figure out the UI for letting people know what they need to remember/learn at each section of the semitruck. I am looking to commision an 3d artist to make me a fully 1:1 model of a semi truck with full detail of the engine, the catwalk with cords, and all of that goodness. If you have any idea for this learning experience, I'm all ears!\r\n\r\nI'm aiming to have this able to play on an Oculus Quest for mobility and affordability of a headset.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:56:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/967/9677d6cc20ba930529dc2a7ccf0af412.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Domo326"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
