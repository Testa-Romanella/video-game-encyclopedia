They are trying to do the same to you. Its 3 platforms, Center, Bottom and Top. You Descend/Ascend between platforms until you either \"Lose\" at the bottom or \"Win\" at the top.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was supposed to have a lot more polish even though I was shooting for the Compo and made everything myself (its a disaster even for \"Programmer Art\" standards I'd say lol) but IRL happened and I ended up getting under 20 hours of development time within the full 72 hours, a lot of which was just chatting to folks (I thought I'd stream the whole process but I'm easily distracted. Not the best idea, was fun.) Anyway, ended up having the gameplay done and not much else for the spice but I know some folks in my community want to mess with it so I decided to do a quick wrap-up and publish.\u00a0 Enjoy the PEWS!</p>\n<p>*The Enemies (\"Beepboops\") are a concept/mascot of a content creator friend, Ophelia, recreated in ProBuilder with permission as an inside joke.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:33:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a95/a9559c036bfcbb30e0e1eb2ad5ec440c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arkhaniir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
