This isn't that kind of game.<br/><br/>No, you see, <strong>F*ck This Game</strong> is a game that is extremely difficult. The premise may sound simple: use the keys on your keyboard to control small minigames, including a side-scrolling platformer and a shoot-em-up game. But here's the catch: you'll have to control up to 8 of these games at the same time.<br/><br/>You'll earn points for doing certain things, whether it's jumping over an obstacle or catching fruit in a basket. Some of the minigames feature <strong>2x multipliers</strong>, giving you a chance to get an even higher score! But don't hit any obstacles... when you drop to 0 points, you lose!<br/><br/>And let's not forget all the wonderous ways the game will attempt to forcefully deplete your score. Whether it's covering up the minigames, big bugs blocking your view, or even playing random sounds, you'll be constantly barraged with distraction after distraction! Unfair as it may be, do you think you're up to the challenge?<h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li> Arcade-style gameplay<br/></li><li> 16 minigames to play<br/></li><li> Original soundtrack composed entirely by helloitscrash<br/></li><li> Fun instructional art<br/></li><li> <strong>a\u0337\u0358\u033e\u0341\u0300\u034b\u0349\u035c\u033c\u0354n\u0334\u034b\u0329t\u0338\u0305\u0306\u0344\u0310\u0344\u031f\u032c\u033a\u0353i\u0338\u0308\u0340\u0318\u032d\u035c\u0355c\u0335\u0309\u0360\u0333\u0359i\u0334\u033d\u0314\u031a\u0352\u0341\u0359\u0329\u0353\u0327\u0318p\u0334\u0357\u035d\u033f\u034d\u0348\u0332a\u0338\u0310\u0342\u035d\u0302\u0346\u0333\u0353\u035a\u0325\u032a\u0356\u0331\u033at\u0336\u0350\u0315\u032b\u031c\u032f\u033c\u0347\u032ei\u0335\u0313\u0306\u0311\u034c\u0314\u030b\u0347\u0316\u032b\u0325\u032c\u0324\u035a\u034eo\u0337\u0308\u0314\u033d\u0356n\u0337\u035b\u033d\u030c\u0310\u0350\u033e\u0358\u0342\u0347\u034e\u034e\u033c\u031c\u0333\u0345\u031c\u0326</strong><br/></li><li> Retro graphics and sound effects<br/></li><li> Customizable options, including multiple backgrounds</li></ul><h3>FREQUENTLY ANSWERED QUESTIONS</h3><ul><li> Isn't that supposed to be \"asked?\" Not \"answered?\"<br/>Yeah.
