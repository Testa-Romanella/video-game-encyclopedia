Can you survive the onslaught of enemies without breaking the Samurai Code?</p>\n<p>UPDATE 1: You can now actually defeat your enemies and rack up your kill count. You can also currently slay the innocent pink bystander balls with no consequences, which goes a bit off message so please ignore that.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 2: You can now Boost forwards by pressing enter! Boosting has a cooldown, but if you slay an enemy using your boost, it recharges inmediately, allowing you to chain boosts! Aditionally, bystanders work properly now, so be mindful of the pink balls!</p>\n<p>UPDATE 3: Added a sneaky new enemy... Watch out, some of those bystanders may not be as innocent as they seem... Also added a small difference between game over screens and some extra tutorial text to explain how Boosting works</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T04:50:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b19/b19225e710d12f227392fee2e1665954.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NicoGreene"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
