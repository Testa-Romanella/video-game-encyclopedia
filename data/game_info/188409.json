We chose the genres of fishing game and tower defense. </p>\n<p>The Spiel: We Are Not Spies (Spies We Are Not) bring you a Claude Van Clam presentation. Roberto Fishermun is having a fishing trip, when he is attacked by stock zombies in hockey masks (they were infected at a nearby Halloween party). Seems like his degree in mechanical fish engineering is going to come in handy. </p>\n<p>How To Play: Build and upgrade turrets and your hook with the UI buttons in the build phase, in the fight phase fish for money to buy more turrets. Can only fish by your blanket. Controls: Escape - Pause WASD - Move Space - Fish in Fight phase. Skip build phase. Enter - Turn off range and health. Click - Interact with UI buttons.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b5/7b511e5285b00d3abbbd3c29f341ac59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["We Are Not Spies"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
