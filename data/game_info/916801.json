Those who survived struggle to find their way through the marshes and scorched lands, fighting against smugglers, marauders and the horrendous beasts called \"mutazione\".

Your duty for now is to defend yourself amidst those beasts, so watch out and don't turn yourself in one of them! Also, you have the best partner these days, a V8 powered tunned muscle car.
