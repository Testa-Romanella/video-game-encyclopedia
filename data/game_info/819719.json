You take damage from enemy projectiles, but also every 30 seconds. If face value hits 0, you die.<br/>Resting at the checkpoints replenishes all of the face values to full.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This is game submission for the GMTKJam 2022. My first real attempt to make a game in Unreal. Solo project, so didn't get a chance to finish a lot of things, so any and all feedback ins appreciated.<br/></p>\n<p>Level design and UI took the biggest hit when came time to cutting corners, I was originally planning to have interconnected world with shortcuts and things, but alas it was not to be. Hope to rivisit this idea after the jam and flesh it out.</p>\n<p>\r\nEngine: UE5\r\n</p>\n<p>Assets used:\u00a0<br/>Deamscape Nature: Meadow<br/>Lowpoly Style Asia Environment</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T19:48:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b0/8b0e8770bc0a1f3acb3cff163120bfea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Codoor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
