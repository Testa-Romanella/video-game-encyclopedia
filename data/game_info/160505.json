The goal is to reach all of the checkpoints which have a distinct sound. After reaching all of the checkpoints you've won the game although it is extremely difficult. Avoid the enemies (they sound like a buzzing noise) and listen for a change in your footstep sound because that means you're near a hole that will kill you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9ab56474619eb42a917fe99a9b2c74c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AdamMizell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
