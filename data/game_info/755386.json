However he does stand out for proving the most loyal subject to one of the most\u00a0\u00a0corrupt rulers of his time. Each week a new person is sent to jail or executed for the belief that the king feels challenged in his position or the false\u00a0word of heresy has been thrown about. However, Jedin's story is different as he has more willpower than most victims of a corrupt king down and decides to take matters into\u00a0his own hands, by assassinating\u00a0the king at his own trial, proving that he guilt came after the accusation of being a heretic and no different. It isn't\u00a0safe whilst he is\u00a0known for such an act, so he must escape the castle and into the forest\u00a0where he can build his journey anew.</p>\n<p>Controls -</p>\n<p>A - Left</p>\n<p>S - Back</p>\n<p>D - Right</p>\n<p>W - Forward</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Sprint</p>\n<p>Mouse Move - Control Camera</p>\n<p>E - Assasinate Target</p>\n<p>Left Click - Swing Dagger</p>\n<p>Used Assets-</p>\n<p>\"Medieval dagger 3d model\" (https://skfb.ly/6XNEx) by Mordius is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
