Is it the power to slice? The power to dice or be sheathed? Is it the power of mild electro-conductivity or gradual oxidised corrosion? All of the above? He intends to find out as he wields these obvious and irrefutable powers to slaughter mighty enemies, mostly chickens, solve puzzles and have strict words with those who brought him into this mess.<br/><br/><strong>The Sword of Unspoken Misc is an absurd, short, Heavy Metal comedy adventure game. It\u2019s full of puzzles, chuckles and tough combat. It\u2019s the perfect way to spend a lazy Sunday for the price of a cup of coffee, provided that cup of coffee is about five U.S. bucks.</strong><br/><br/>This game inherits the look and feel of a DS game, with a custom retro engine, whilst following the exceptional storyline that is Tower of Fire\u2019s The Sword of Unspoken Misc.
