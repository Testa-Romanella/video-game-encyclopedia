(uses three energy).  <br/></p>\n<p>Right trigger to dash. (uses one energy). <br/></p>\n<p>Explaination of Gameplay:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Survive as long as you can, and rack up the highest score you can. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The two ways to loose:</p>\n<p> 1. Fill up your barf meter. Hitting one object gives you a letter, if you get 5 letters (b,a,r,f,d) you loose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. You run out of time. <br/></p>\n\n<p>you gain more time by reaching the generators (the next generators direction is indicated by the flashing purple orb). </p>\n<p>Pickups give you energy and a tiny time boost:</p>\n<p> 1. Snakes are safe, eat them for energy and time. if you eat the whole snake you will reduce one barf letter on the barf counter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Candy (the box shaped objects) are safe too, eat them for time and energy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Advoid:</p>\n<p>1. Walls, they will hurt you. go around them or jump over them. <br/></p>\n<p>2. Spikes, and bullets these will hurt you if you hit them. you can:</p>\n<p>a. jump over them,</p>\n<p>b.\u00a0 advoid them, <br/></p>\n<p>c. spin into them to destroy them. <br/></p>\n<p>3. the cannons shoot the bullets you can spin into them to destory them.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Look out for machines to trade energy for barf letters or time. <br/></p>\n<p>Good luck. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Audio Tracks Used under the\u00a0 CC BY-NC-SA <br/>Nul Tiel Records <br/>Airflow</p>\n<p>Beam</p>\n<p>Cloud Cover</p>\n<p>Empty Head</p>\n<p>Festoon</p>\n<p>Glass Beach</p>\n<p>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/nul-tiel-records/electronica/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T22:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a46/a4690b6189393882169dbc64fa540408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jers"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
