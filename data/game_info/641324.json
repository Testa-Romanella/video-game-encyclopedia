Gather around your computer with a friend, family member, or enemy to see who is the fastest. Test your platforming skills with two vastly different characters in this asymmetric platforming race. On the right side you have the red robot who can run and jump like your average platformer. On the left side you have the blue robot who cannot jump, but instead can flip their own gravity to traverse the ceiling. Avoid saws and snakes to reach the goal-button before your opponent; the best out of three races wins!\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T07:58:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/254/254e5bd3bd2edcec80be7b61edf13362.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["haysmn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
