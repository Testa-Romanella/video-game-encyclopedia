The objective of this project was to develop a completely opengl engine to improve our programming, modeling, and artistic knowledge by doing work from scratch to aggregate value to our portfolio. Also, we wanted to put into practice the contents applied in both subjects of software engineering and advanced programming.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nDeveloped in the C ++ programming language, using the OpenGL 3.3 API.<br/>\r\nCharacters modeling using Autodesk Maya and Blender software.<br/>\r\nImage editing with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.<br/>\r\nTextures creation with Substance Painter.<br/>\n</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Pam was sure his daughter had disappeared, but everyone around him claims he never had a daughter. He tries to find her at all costs, as he clearly remembers her and his love for her, but he cannot find any evidence that she once existed. He struggles at all costs to find clues and make sure it really exists. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAfter some time, he begins to question whether it really exists and start committing some crazy things and suspecting everyone around him. He continues his search, which many thought was craziness, until he committed an extreme act and finds a clue. He ends up in a madhouse for being denounced by friends and relatives who are sure he doesn't have a daughter. Although arrested and doped, at least now he is sure that he has a daughter and that he must find her, whatever the cost.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The player needs to explore the scenario searching for papers while running away from the monster, being able to use the weapon to delay it and so that he can finish the game.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>W / A / S / D</strong> - Controls the player.<br/>\n<strong>KEY SHIFT</strong> - Makes the character aim.<br/>\n<strong>KEY ENTER</strong> - Interact with objects and shoot if you are aiming.<br/>\n</p>\r\nTeam Members\r\n<p>\n<strong>Fernando Cesar dos Santos Concei\u00e7\u00e3o</strong> - 3D Modeling.<br/>\n<strong>Gabrielle Martins Rom\u00e3o</strong> - Concept arts and 2D art.<br/>\n<strong>Jimi Tombolatto Gantinis</strong> - Sound Design.<br/>\n<strong>Jonathan Gon\u00e7alves de Oliveira</strong> - Programming.<br/>\n<strong>Paulo Fernando da Silva</strong> - 3D Modeling and Programming.<br/>\n<strong>Vinicius Soares Ferraz</strong> - 3D Modeling and Programming.<br/>\n</p>\r\nAcademic Advisor\r\n<p>\n<strong>Adilson Ferreira da Silva</strong> - Advanced Programming.<br/>\n<strong>Leandro Ramos da Silva</strong> - Software Engineering 2.<br/>\n</p>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<ol>\n<li>Camera sometimes guides in one direction making the character go left or right alone while walking forward</li>\n</ol>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\r\n    Learn opengl for tutorials\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T22:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/419/419d9c2ad2c69c0578e5fdf2e15c1292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ronan312"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
