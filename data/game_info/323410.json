Unlike most partnership Pinochle games, Cutthroat pits each player against one another, every man for himself. It\u2019s a fast-paced, highly competitive, and very strategic card game, requiring careful planning, good memory and discipline.<br/><br/>In this game, you can play online against real people or choose between 8 computer opponents, each with different skill levels and unique styles of playing. Each player is dealt 15 cards with 3 cards dealt face-down to the widow. Players bid after initial cards are dealt and the high bidder combines the widow cards to potentially form a stronger hand, then discarding the three weakest cards.<br/><br/>As of this release there are 10 options to customize game play to user preferences:<br/><br/> Number of Decks: Single|Double<br/><br/>Sound Effects: On|Off<br/><br/>Game Speed: Normal|Fast|Slow<br/><br/>Undo Button: On|Off<br/><br/>Must bid to win: On|Off<br/><br/>Minimum Trick Points: 0|1|2<br/><br/>Minimum Bid: 15|20|25<br/><br/>Bid Increment: 1|2|3<br/><br/>Point to Win: 75|100|150<br/><br/>Must Throw Higher Card: On|Off|Trumps<br/><br/>Must have marriage in trump: On|Off<br/><br/>Winner if multiple players make winning score", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:01:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f6/2f66ab3ba86e91f91fadb7b20ecf0edc_CZGDSt0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GLOBE NETWORKING"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["GLOBE NETWORKING"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
