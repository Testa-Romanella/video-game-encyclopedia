{"id": 970738, "slug": "battle-for-iwo-jima", "name": "Battle for Iwo Jima", "name_original": "Battle for Iwo Jima", "description": "Battle for Iwo Jima simulates the Invasion and desperate fighting for the island from Feb 19th, 1945 to March 26th, 1945. You take command of the US Marines and will test your ability to do better than those brave Marines did back in 1945.<br/><br/><h3>Realistic battle depiction</h3><br/>Each turn in the game represents one day with each day broken into phases. In each phase you get to move, support, or attack following a strategy that has to combine enemy lines penetration, HQ communication lines, and overall support for the units that are in heavy contact with the enemy.<br/>Units are approximately company-sized.<br/><br/><h3>A challenging strategic problem</h3><br/>Be warned this is not an easy game to win. You will need to exercise Command and Control over your units by keeping them in range of their HQ to retain their effectiveness in battle. Armor should be used in a supporting role and not in the front lines otherwise the Japanese will eat them for breakfast. Troops need to rest and not be constantly engaged in combat. Numbers are on your side but the enemy has strong defensive positions and amazing fighting ability.<br/><br/><h3>Make the most of your resources</h3><br/>Use the support points on units that are likely to be fired upon by the Japanese, especially when moving, to reduce your losses. Keep your units fatigue levels low by resting them from combat as they will become less effective as they keep on fighting.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T19:46:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ae/6ae3aa976bfd6ee4231de8cdbc2dd1c3.jpg", "website": "http://www.yobowargames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yobowargames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Yobowargames"], "esrb_rating": null}
