Sounds simple, but rapidly becomes a test of quick thinking and fast reflexes.</p>\n<p>Use your finger or drag the mouse to change the direction of the tiles.\u00a0The tiles will follow the grid, so it may take a few seconds for the to change direction and be\u00a0vigilant, they do bounce of one another and may change direction.<br/><br/>This games looks easy. Simply get the coloured blocks to the same coloured edge and score a point. But watch out, there is not just one block on the board and you have to avoid a collision or end up bouncing off each other and moving in the opposite direction. Don't let the wrong colour get to the incorrect edge as that will mean your going to have to start again.<br/><br/>As the game advances you have to handle more and more blocks and a game that started off appearing so simple and relaxing, becomes a battle for control and a test of the your coordination and reaction times as you try to get your blocks safely home.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T20:37:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d64788ff5c403c8a2feec1821b1e8385.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Home Planet Software"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
