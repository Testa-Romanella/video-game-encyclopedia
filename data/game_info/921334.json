It is casual, kinda rhytm-based game where you should jump on play tiles, avoiding roots from feet and picking up an axes to deal damage to the big boss-tree. We had a lot of ambitions about that game but unfortunally we couldn't deal with all of them for that short period of time. In any case, we made it for pure fun, for some kind of achievement or proof that we can do that and we will continue develop that game after the Jam because we have fallen in love with it, with its development processes and so we hope that you can enjoy it too. Move with \"W\" \"A\" \"S\" \"D\". That's all, Have Fun ^^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T21:49:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d0/6d0f0fbcf3caad68d177b170946a11fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BohdanZolottse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
