To shoot, first start aiming by holding the left trigger, or aim directly backwards by holding the left bumper. Then, focus on the target by holding the right trigger. If you've locked on successfully, an aim indicator will appear around the target. Once that indicator turns red, release the right trigger to fire. Getting shot knocks a racer off course, respawning a few seconds later. The enemies can shoot back at the player and each other, so be careful!</p>\n<p>Press the right bumper to boost. Each player gets a single boost charge each time they shoot an enemy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be the first to complete 3 laps to win.</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Game is fully controllable with controller only</p>\n<p>Steer/Accelerate: Left Stick<br/>Start Aiming: Left Trigger<br/>Start Aiming (Backward): Left Bumper<br/>Focus: Right Trigger<br/>Shoot: Release Right Trigger when Aim Indicator is red<br/>Boost: Right Bumper</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T06:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/5672cefa7072de0effb91905045a9da7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShinyOlivia"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
