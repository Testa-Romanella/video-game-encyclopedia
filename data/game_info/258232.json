Harvesting crops earns money that can be used to buy more crops and other stuff for the farm. Crops all have different growth rates, yields and sell values.</p>\n<p>This is a very early version of the game. Grow times and prices need to be  balanced better. I plan to add a 'rot' mechanic and I have a few other ideas that I might add. The game is pretty easy in its current state.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9df5761585065bdd03f2b2715ab9863a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
