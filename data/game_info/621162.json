The goal of the game is to have each character on top of a green box(goal tile).</p>\n<p>Use the \"R\" key to restart the level, the \"B\" to jump back to the previous level and \"N\" key to skip to the next level.</p>\n<p>I made this game by myself so I didn't have time to make the it prettier, but I hope you can still enjoy it. I've play tested and beat each level multiple times so rest assured they're all solvable (even 11 and 12).</p><p>NOTE: The game loops back after the 12th level, so if it feels like you're playing from the start again, it's because you are haha.
