[hide] \u00a0<br/>Tips:<br/>1. Try and Go To the 'Left, South-West' downward first when you first leave the Vacation Sword Technique Learning Complex.<br/>You will Notice a stairway leading up, it leads straight to the Golden Lock-block the story itself Mentions on his way back home.<br/>Being blocked off, stuff is waiting 'North-West' after you leave the Orange stairway leading to that area.<br/>Buy the Green Ring to halt Damage a bit, so you as the player can survive brutal Octorock attacks.<br/>2. Seek 'North-East' after you leave the Sword Technique Complex as soon as you can: You'll eventually find a mountain tower with the sound of the Ocean and sea some place as you climb up the stairs.<br/>&gt;Grab the 'Medicine-Bottle Prescription Paper' from the Man inside the Cave on top.</p>\n<p>3. Head up the Orange staircases near the cave you got the Paper after.<br/>To get the Full effects of the First location, you will find tourists and a museum up above.<br/>You can Talk to only 'some people' when you walk close to them on the side. An 'exclamation mark bubble' will appear over Link as you can select them to hear them speak.</p>\n<p>Also Notice: Rupees are considered easier to grab in this game because you will be 'pushed a-lot' into buying tons of Keys like crazy, just to be able, to solve dungeon puzzles and some complicated contraptions.<br/>[/hide] <br/>Developer Notes:<br/>-In the Original Zelda Game, i always loved the Idea of buying 'Extra spare keys', so i implemented that system and unique feeling into this game. However there are some keys you can Only use, in the Dungeons alone..<br/>As they will disappear when you leave certain dungeons and 'Re-appear' if you Re-enter the Dungeons.</p>\n<p>Also, there are Some Items that will not show up if you enter some new map locations:<br/>They are Deactivated for that one area; Until an upgraded Level- version of that weapon is obtained.</p>\n<p>'That one Item' such as the Magic-Candle or Rocky-Hammer cannot be used on some Maps for example: Until you have gotten the next upgraded Version of that same weapon.</p>\n<p>----- Other Info: From Amino interview Spoilers.
