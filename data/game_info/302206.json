He\u00a0doesn't\u00a0know\u00a0which realm is more real, but he knows that he must find\u00a0the\u00a0best\u00a0bargains if he\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0survive!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lord Of The Mall<br/>Lord Of Them All!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a 3D rogue-like adventure/shopping action/stealth game, set in a procedurally-generated\u00a0 shopping\u00a0mall / dungeon. Hunt for the best bargains in the mall realm to heal, restore mojo, and power up. Search for gold in the dungeon realm, while avoiding the dangerous monsters that prowl the depths. The gold automatically gets converted to cash in the mall realm.<br/></p>\n<p> <strong>Goal:\u00a0</strong>Reach the 11th level of the mall/dungeon safely to escape. There is no experience for killing things. Use stealth and wits if you want to take a more peaceful route. You automatically level up when you reach the stairs in each level, and can permanently increase your stats by finding and buying high end bargains.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Control</strong>WalkWASD keys<br/>SmiteSpacebar<br/>[This costs 1 mojo]<br/>Camera<br/>Move mouse to rotate camera<br/>Scrollwheel to zoom in/out<br/>Pause/MenuEscapePickup Coin<br/>Just walk onto it<br/>View/Buy Deal<br/>Go close to it to view it's benefits and cost<br/>E key to buy it and apply its effects to your stats<br/>\n<p><strong>Coins/Money:</strong> Pick up gold coins in the dungeon realm. Use different camera angles to find them. They turn into cash in the mall realm, and are used for buying things there.</p>\n<p><strong>Bargains:</strong> Hunt for the red \"on sale\" signs in the mall realm. Stand next to them to see what benefits there are and how much it costs. Some will heal you, restore your mojo, or increase your max health/mojo. If you can afford it and it looks like a good deal, press E to buy it and apply its effects to your stats.</p>\n<p><strong>Goblins: </strong>Goblins can only see you when you are in the dungeon realm, but they can't see through walls, and are they are not too bright. A single smite should be enough to kill nearby goblins. You can even smite through the walls. As you delve deeper, the goblins will do more and more damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Mojo:</strong> This is how much magical energy you have left. It costs 1 mojo to perform a smite. If your mojo is empty, then you will not be able to smite. Refill mojo by buying the right bargains.</p>\n<p>This game is the sequel to Lord of the Aisle, one of my previous jam games, which took place in a single supermarket aisle. This time around, the old man ventures out again, in a mall/dungeon. I reused the old man and the faceless people that I made for that game. I also used a modified version of the goblins I made for Magic Missile Command, another jam game.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-Party Assets: </strong>Music \"Local Forecast\" and \"The Descent\" by Kevin McLeod (incompetech.com) (Creative Commons by Attribution 3.0).
