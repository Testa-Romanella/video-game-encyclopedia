{"id": 603137, "slug": "delugem", "name": "delugem", "name_original": "delugem", "description": "<p><em>It's a deluge of gems.</em></p>\n<p><strong>delugem </strong>was made as a C++ and SDL 2.0 exercise over the course of two weeks. It is an implementation of an advancing block puzzle where <strong>groups of gems with the same colour can be broken by clicking on them</strong>. Periodically, new columns of gems appear in the right side of the screen. If any gem crosses the \"<em>End Zone\" </em>threshold, the game is over. Try to break large groups of gems to rack up higher scores!</p>\n<p>Players can also force a new column to appear through the <strong>Push </strong>button and fill the whole board with gems in case they get stuck with the <strong>Fill </strong>button (only three times per game, though). On the top of the screen the current level and score are displayed, as well as the required score to level up. Whenever a new level is reached, the board resets to its initial position! <br/></p>\n<p>If you find a bug, want to give feedback, or just want to say hi, please do leave a comment!
