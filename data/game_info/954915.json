As he explores, he understands that these ruins did not harbor a Water VS Plant war, but an alliance against a common enemy, who, in order not to lose, trapped the place in a temporal paradox. And this common enemy is the player. When he learns this, the temporal mechanism engages its last phase and the loop begins again...</p>\n\n<p>Our protagonist is capable of shifting between different version of the\u00a0reality, seen as a forest spirit or a water spirit. Use this ability wisely to discover the strange ruin.</p>\n\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>W - Move forward</p>\n<p>S - Move backward</p>\n<p>Right - Look right</p>\n<p>Left - Look left</p>\n<p>Up - Look up</p>\n<p>Down - Look down</p>\n<p>E - Use / take</p>\n<p>Space - Switch</p><p>By switching souls, you can dodge some attacks (just a helping had (thank you Mamijomale))</p>\n\n<p>Made by :</p>\n<p>UneGrandeCh\u00e8vre</p>\n<p>Ok\u00eeo</p>\n<p>Arkann</p>\n<p>Silverrfr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T11:20:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36b539ffd51b6f5b79720337ca24c673.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bimster"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
