If you have too many dots too count, use the AUTO COUNT feature and let your phone or tablet count the dots for you!<br/><br/><br/>Auto Count will count the dots (a.k.a. pips) on a group of dominoes using the camera. Great for adding up the dots on a large number of tiles at the end of a round of Mexican Train dominoes. Just point the camera at the dominoes you wish to count, and tap anywhere on the screen. The total will appear in a second or two. A circle is drawn around each pip in the image so you can verify what was counted. The total is then added to the player score.<br/><br/><br/>Add or delete players in mid game.<br/>Add more rounds whenever you like. <br/>Long press the player name to customize the name. <br/>The app keeps track of which rounds are complete and will warn you if you try to rescore a round that has already been scored. <br/>Use the slider at the top to slide through rounds when they can't all be displayed at once.<br/>Rounds can count up or down.<br/><br/><br/>For best results, it is important to hold the camera horizontally over the dominoes. It is also important to play on a solid-colored surface like a wood table or a solid tablecloth.<br/><br/><br/>For those of you who liked the Domino Dot Counter the way it was - don't panic. You can disable scoring in the settings menu.<br/><br/><br/>Please email us with any suggestions, concerns, or problems with the dot counter.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T22:35:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/617/6170972b2857a6cfa0995b151b7bde91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Cyborg Kitten"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
