Disorientation might be imminent if you use it too much.</p>\n<p>Enemies have a 1/10 chance of dropping these items:<br/>- Health pack: increase health by 1\u00a0<br/>- Upgrade pack: get the ability to shoot 3 bullets per click, for a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Items that are left alone for 10 seconds will disappear, this is signaled by a flicker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the player ship is hit, he will be invincible for a few seconds, use this time to your advantage and get to a safe space.</p>\n<p>Leave your high score in the comments below, if you have any advice, tips, or just something that you think would be fun if it were to be added to LaserForce, just leave in it there too!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T05:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/594/5946faddb3be339591aa16b9fa5e7e8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Eben Vranken"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
