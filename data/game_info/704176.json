In the current prototype the plants have a simplified model with simple traits like height, size flower or growing speed.</p>\n<p>In the future the simulation will have more tools to interact with the simulation and the plants will grow on a DNA-based model. You can learn more in this video about the design goals and challenges of creating virtual DNA.</p>\n<p><strong>What you will find in Alien Plants: Team Seas</strong></p>\n<p>I originally created this version as a tool for myself to create the narrative of the video about Team Seas in my Youtube channel AlejoLab. So there are not objectives or progression and most controls are key shortcuts, you can interact with the simulation and the features I\u00a0built on top of the current prototype for Alien Plants.</p>\n<p>You will be able to:</p>\n<ul><li>Place seeds to create plants, watch them grow, mutate and evolve</li><li>Plants will only grow near water</li><li>More around or fly as you like and control de speed of the simulation</li><li>Check the energy levels of the plants and nutrients in the soil</li><li>Start/stop the spawning of trash objects</li><li>Increase/decrease the rate of trash spawning</li><li>Summon and control the trash-eating-ship</li></ul>\n<p>Play around with the plants, the trash and the ship as much as you like.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:41:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b51bc455c263c9f21c6b03d945945b47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlejoLab"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
