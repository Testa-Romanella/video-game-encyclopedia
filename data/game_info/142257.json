Defend yourself from enemy fish by dropping nets and eliminating others. Watch out for larger threats however, not everything can be defeated by a net!</p>\n<p>Use the W, A, and D keys to move. Press space to drop a net. Nets are used to catch other fish. They will deteriorate over time. Nets will shrink when you are in them. When other fish touch your net when you are also inside it, they will be caught. Avoid other fish and their nets. Avoid giant fish when a warning flashes.
