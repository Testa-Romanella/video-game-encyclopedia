The info gathered can be used against you or fight you on your own level depending on your difficulty selection.<br />\nChoose between 3 heroes. Reyna the Warrior Vanguard, Hiei the Shinobi Prodigy, or Jamal the Runic Boxing Champion. Each hero commands 64 loadouts to customize how you prefer to fight and will adapt to your playstyle accordingly.<br />\nEach hero travels deep into the crust of their planet, Teiresia, in the name of each of their warring factions. They seek what it would mean to serve, to honor, and to claim glory. Deep in the Sistine Divide, lies a miracle mineral, the Petrago. A place where many heroes on both sides meet their end outside of the Domini-Valkan conflict. Shambling back to life, these heroes join the teeming horde known only as the Slain. Where once Petrago promised an end to the bloody conflict, it now threatens the whole planet. No longer does Petrago fuel the war that ravages the face of Teiresia; the mineral&#39;s soul revival properties serve only as a purgatory of endless battle that serve no nation.<br />\nIf there were a hero that would step forth to rise above the legends that are said to have fallen here. If there were a strength to cut into the earth. If there was a cunning to probe into the mystery.<br />\nOne masters their own story.<br />\nHow will your story be read, hero?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-28T21:04:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8b760dc8648c670258f310e035a83fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ominous Horizon Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ominous Horizon Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
