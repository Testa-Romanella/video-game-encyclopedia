You play as a naked man who suddenly finds himself aboard a mysterious spaceship. The aliens that have abducted you seem to think that your penis is the intelligent life-form - given that it has been controlling your gender of species for eons now. Because they consider your penis as the real threat, their security systems have only been calibrated to detect when your genitals are visible. You however, are completely invisible (by most things). </p><p>Enjoy this short piece!
