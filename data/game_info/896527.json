As a huge fan of the 1.Gen Pok\u00e9mon Games and a self-tought hobby programmer, i tought it would be a good idea to recreate a game as an learning project.</p>\n<p>My \"learning project\" is grown into a full blown project game and the real games i'm working on are stuck in their idea state till this one is finished :-)</p>\n<p>And the reason i'm publishing this project of mine is, its way too sad to play and enjoy it on my own. There are so many people (Pok\u00e9mon-Fans) like me that would love the idea to replay a childhood game in a slightly refurbishd edition and not an complete overhaul, to keep the original nostalgic feeling.</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to hear your thoughts, ideas and general feedback\u00a0for this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Current State is:</p>\n<ul><li>approx. 30% of the overall world are considered finished and playable</li><li>the pokemon system itself is done so pokemon can be created and \"live\"</li><li>wild battle system is 50% done</li><li>safari battle system is 99% done</li><li>storysystem is 80%</li><li>textboxes work as in the original</li><li>traitors work</li><li>story is about 7% done</li><li>you can save and load your game</li><li>trainer battle system is the next thing to do</li><li>and more things i cant recall at the momemt...</li></ul>\n\n<p>The things i plan to do:</p>\n<ul><li>a player colour and some things in the game for example the bike is then coloured in this colour</li><li>add in deleted and beta content</li><li>add in mew in a place to be captured without tricks</li><li>add in npc's that trade the pokemon that only evolve over trade so you can complete the pokedex in singleplayer</li><li>add more places some even hidden</li><li>maybe maybe multiplayer</li><li>full controller support which is about 40%implemented</li><li>shortkeys for some item (map, bike, rod, etc)</li></ul>\n<p>At the current state of development i dont want to upload anything yet because the game has too much bugs and is nearly unplayable for other people.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d4/5d48a7bfc18ba6c009880bd5bf909326.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PasiaGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
