To restore balance to multiple dimensions, our videogame hero Dot recruits the help of the best gamer from 1995, an unassuming 9-year-old boy named David. Join this unlikely duo through challenging throwbacks to all your favorite classics from the late 16-bit and early 32-bit era of games inside a virtual reality world, all while maneuvering through the real life challenges of a kid who just wants to save the world by doing what he does best - playing videogames.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game evokes a genuine nostalgic feeling, such as the adrenaline of playing games without getting caught after your mom told you to go to bed, or the thrill of finding that brand new game at the store. Play through homages to the best video games and genres from the 1990s, including action RPGs, brawlers, 2D platformers, space shooters and racing games. You have to do all that and more while you dodge the ire of your parents through multiple environments - including your living room, bedroom, the local video rental store, the arcade at the pier, and more. With 6 fully original and highly differentiated levels, where each one feels like an entire new game, Pixel Ripped 1995 is an incredible journey for both VR and retro gamers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T02:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/787/787492f8586958bde69749ca54d45808.jpg", "website": "http://www.pixelripped.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 29, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["ARVORE Immersive Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ARVORE Immersive Experiences"], "esrb_rating": null}
