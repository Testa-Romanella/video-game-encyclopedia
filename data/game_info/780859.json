I made this tool to speed up that process!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>My main goal with Username Generator was to make it feel very random and varied, even if it means that some results will be quite incoherent. In real life, online usernames don't follow a small set of patterns, there's a huge range of typing quirks!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Note: Sorry that copying a username makes a popup. GameMaker 2's HTML5 export can't copy stuff to clipboard, however the downloadable .exe of Username Generator will do this.\u00a0Also,\u00a0if the tool goes black, that means it has crashed and you'll need to refresh the page!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T14:20:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18f/18fde80bb114bf44f1b040ffd52bc85c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Niandra!"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
