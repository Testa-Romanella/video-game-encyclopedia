Interaction with <strong>bulls</strong> and <strong>bears</strong> will simulate the <strong>highs</strong> and <strong>lows </strong>of the market. As the player climbs the graph, it gets harder over time to maintain a positive quarterly income that contributes to revenue, which represents the player's score at the end of the game! Good luck fighting the bears and bulls of the <strong>Economy!!! </strong><br/><br/>Facebook Page:<br/>https://www.facebook.com/maddashfocash/?fref=ts <br/><strong>*PC Standalone and Android APK Download Links here*</strong><br/><br/>This is done as a short-project on <strong>Singapore's DBS Game Jam 15</strong>.
