He decides to send a single Tentacute to go make new friends with these \"Bonies.\" After enough friends have been made, the portal to R'lyeh opens &amp;each friend will be sacrificed. In a style that is a cross between \"Hotline Miami\" and \"Pikmin\", convert your friends into fellow cute cephalopods! The problem? All of your newly converted friends are frickin' morons that mimic your every move! Luckily with strategic planning you can manipulate them against the environment to get back to the portal home to keep Lord Cthulhu company. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPC Controls:<br/>\r\n\u2022 WASD/\u2191\u2193\u2192\u2190 - Move Swarm<br/>\r\n\u2022 Space - Clump<br/>\r\n\u2022 Mouse - Menu Navigation (not required)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nXbox Controls:<br/>\r\n\u2022 Left Stick - Move Swarm<br/>\r\n\u2022 Right Stick - Rotate Swarm<br/>\r\n\u2022 A - Clump/Enter<br/>\r\n\u2022 Start - Pause/Menu Open/Menu Close<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 Control Swarm - Control your swarm in a QWOP manner. <br/>\r\n\u2022 Feed - Convert friendly neighbors into one of the swarm. <br/>\r\n\u2022 Form - Squish and squash your swarm into different shapes and sizes. <br/>\r\n\u2022 Clump - Bring all your friends close together! <br/>\r\n\u2022 Explore - What's that over there? <br/>\r\n\u2022 Sacrifice - Send your new friends home to Lord Cthulhu through the sacrificial alter.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b7/8b7cfa5aa97684e0c77bc2c1af683477.jpg", "website": "http://www.saltyslothstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Salty Sloth Studios L.L.C."], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Salty Sloth Studios L.L.C."], "esrb_rating": null}
