My fascination with this genre started with Undertale and has never ended. When I heard the theme was \"You are not alone,\" I immediately thought of the ghosts from Mario that only move when you are looking away. One week later, I had this. I knew I\u00a0wanted to have something with the word dark or light in the title because this game is about lights, but while looking through synonyms, I\u00a0found the word shroud. I plugged it into a game name generator and got \"Shroudoom\".</p>\n<p>This is the first time I\u00a0have ever attempted a challenge like this, and I\u00a0would love to hear how people feel about the game. I\u00a0would love to see people sharing their scores in the comments!\u00a0After playtesting the first few levels of Shroudoom,\u00a0I realized I\u00a0had accidently created a rage game, so apologies in advance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T16:44:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/476/4760d2b51583806e022ad80e7693117c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PythonEnthusiast"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
