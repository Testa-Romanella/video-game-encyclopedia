As you wake up, you discover there is a possible cure for your Brand. Meduir can be used in the game for many things, most importantly leveling up, but it's a limited resource. Not to worry, the monsters around will provide plenty if defeated, but who's to say how long they'll stay down?<br/><br/><br/>This game has been cancelled and will see no further updates. However, who's to say it won't see some sort of revival in the future?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1c/a1c2368306b36ec2b3ae9efc208def82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CappuccinoGuil"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
