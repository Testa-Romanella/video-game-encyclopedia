For those of you playing on non-QWERTY keyboard layouts, I'm sorry! I'll be uploading alternate control schemes in a post-compo version; my submission time was down to the wire as is. <br/><br/>There are several theme tie-ins: <br/>- You only get one gem of each color (at a time) <br/>- You only get one life (until the next checkpoint) <br/>- You only get one level (mastering it gets harder) <br/>For the non-QWERTY people: <br/>- You only get one control scheme (sorry guys XD) <br/>For those who make it all the way to level 3: <br/>- You only get one [REDACTED] <br/><br/>In the end, Only One Remains. <br/>Good luck! <br/><br/><br/><br/>In-game help follows: <br/><br/>Welcome to ONLY ONE REMAINS! <br/><br/>Arrow keys move, Z &amp; X rotate your pods. <br/><br/>Collect gems with your pods in order to clear like-colored gates. <br/>If a full pod touches another gem the gem will be destroyed, if it is a like-colored gem the pod will also emptied. <br/>You only get one gem of each color - filling a pod with a duplicate gem will empty all your pods. <br/>Finally, protect your centroid - if it touches a gate or gem it will be disintegrated. <br/><br/>Survive all the levels to win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11e/11ed7caa57b5a2833e264085cf21cd24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["huhwhozat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
