Sit back, relax, and let the disembodied green head guide you.

Made in Unity, modeled in 3dsmax. No plugins used.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the TrainJam team, and the Amtrak crew that created the opportunity to have this amazing traveling experience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:29:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c28/c283e7e62f8337b568f67b1313cd5fdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GermainCouet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
