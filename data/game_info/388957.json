Dracula has his undead hands full in this all-new adventure that pits him against a truculent trio of aging witches who will stop at nothing to restore their youth. There's more at stake than their smooth skin and full-bodied hair; if the old hags succeed, they will have emptied the world of magic forever!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThrough 50 levels packed with captivating challenges that will test your gray matter and pit you against the clock, you'll smash your way through obstacles, rebuild ravaged villages and produce the resources you need to accomplish these and other tasks. Using boosters, spells and old fashioned elbow grease, you'll complete dozen of side quests for zany characters, defeat wacky enemies and learn the truth about the witches' plans.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach level will introduce you to new characters and hurdles. In one, you'll learn a spell that allows you to banish a dark spirit from a snowman; in another, you'll learn how to make a potion that can transform Dracula's wife into a bat so she can scale a volcano before it erupts. Hours of fun lie ahead of those who embark on this epic journey!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHas Dracula met his match or can he save the day? The fate of all magic is in your hands!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022\tHumor-filled story of adventure and magic<br/>\r\n\u2022\tCraft items, cast spells and make potions<br/>\r\n\u2022\tGame modes for casual and skilled players<br/>\r\n\u2022\tVibrant, colorful artwork and animation<br/>\r\n\u2022\tLearn-as-you-play tutorial", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T02:00:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/111/1113320157c2d0e9869ee5c713fb9324.jpg", "website": "https://steamcommunity.com/groups/alawargames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 14}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Platinum Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alawar Premium"], "esrb_rating": null}
