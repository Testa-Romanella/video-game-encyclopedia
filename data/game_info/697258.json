{"id": 697258, "slug": "paintkiller-rodshot", "name": "PaintKiller (Rodshot)", "name_original": "PaintKiller (Rodshot)", "description": "<p>PaintKiller is a First-Person Shooter game where the player has to destroy the paintball aliens who had recently invaded the earth and save the planet again from their mischief. There are different types of enemies with different behaviors each being unique to create a fun experience. The art style of this game is based on simple geometric shapes and vibrant colors.</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>The player has a gun that can shoot two different bullets towards the enemies. The red enemies take damage only from the green bullets and the pink enemies take damage only from the blue bullets. The miniboss has both the properties, so he can be shot with both bullets but depending on what form he is currently in.</p>\r\nImportant Note\r\n<p>This is a basic prototype that has been made in a very short period of time. So there are some bugs that need to be fixed in the future. Some of the bugs you might encounter while playing are listed below:</p>\n<ul><li>The pink enemies may sometimes go out of bounce from the play area due to one of their physical properties.</li><li>The cursor may appear sometimes when playing as there is no crosshair added to the game yet.</li><li>If the cursor bug appears there is a chance that the player might not be able to restart the level or go back to the menu from the game over screen. (Suggestion: In this case, you can just reload the page and start playing again.\u00a0\u00a0 ;)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T10:45:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f9/0f981c5e7a65f809f60367a2b553e71a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rodshot"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
