{"id": 702096, "slug": "earthrise", "name": "Earthrise", "name_original": "Earthrise", "description": "<p>This 3d flight simulator uses realistic flight physics to enable you, the pilot, to fly your plane through realistic maneuvers. The multiplayer aspect enables you to fight other pilots.</p>\n<p>Four aircraft types are available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses:</p>\n<ul><li>Mitsubishi A6M Zero - an extremely agile dogfighter</li><li>Vought F4U Corsair\u00a0- a high-speed fighter with inverted gull wings</li><li>North American P51 Mustang - a multirole fighter with a rapid-fire gun</li><li>Republic P47 Thunderbolt\u00a0- a slow armored fighter with a powerful cannon</li></ul>\n<p>All are based on real WWII fighters.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse for orientation control and throttle. WASD can also be used, but the mouse is more responsive and is recommended.</p>\n<p>Landing gear can be toggled by pressing F.</p>\n<p>When landed, press E to switch aircrafts.</p>\n<p>Press Space to fire. Press Shift to toggle scope.</p>\n<p>Press Escape to toggle fullscreen. Keep in mind that this will reset your progress.</p>\n<p>When landed, press Q to pause or unpause game. You cannot pause while in the air.</p><p>Press C to chat.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay and notes:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The goal of this game is to shoot down as many other players without being shot yourself. Some airplanes have a more powerful cannon (like the P47 Thunderbolt) and do not have to aim as accurately. Other airplanes such as the P51 Mustang have higher rates of fire but lower bullet power, requiring higher pilot experience and accuracy.</p>\n<p>Note that the bullets are affected by gravity. When targeting faraway objects, you must compensate for bullet drop.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, some planes (such as the A6M Zero) have tighter turning radii as others. Players with Zeroes can turn faster than other players' aircraft and are very hard to shake off.</p>\n<p>Fast crafts like the Corsair can outrun them, though.</p>\n<p>Because of the clouds, it's hard to see objects far away. So if you just want some peaceful flying, or some flying practice before you fight other players, fly far away from the runway, because it's very unlikely that someone would chase you that far out. You can also practice landing there. Any beach serves as a useable runway.</p>\n<p>If you get lost and can't find the runway, or other players, you can reset back to the start by pressing Escape twice. This will reset your score, however.</p>\n<p>You cannot fly past the world borders. There is also a flight ceiling.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T09:38:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1dba70fa9cd9d8e8c4e5c1e1a527af82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vmhl87"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
