Explore the station, uncovering clues to the crew\u2019s mysterious disappearance. They found something on the planet, and brought it back to orbit \u2014 but what else did they bring with it?<br/><br/>Welcome to The Zeta Orbital. Can you find the answers, navigate the station, and scavenge enough resources to escape?<h3>A Rogue-(like)-like</h3><br/>The decks of the Zeta Orbital are procedurally generated, and you can save your progress only when moving between them. Scavenge precious resources to explore each level, but never take your eye off your oxygen supply.<br/><br/><h3>An intricately-woven story</h3><br/>The orbital\u2019s crew didn\u2019t disappear all at once \u2014 and left their own theories about what they saw happening around them scattered in their PDAs &amp; terminals. Piece together what really happened from snippets and suggestions as you make your way through the crew\u2019s quarters.<br/><br/><h3>Every system a puzzle</h3><br/>Many doors were left locked on the orbital, and many of its support systems are barely functioning. You\u2019ll need to restore what you can if you want to escape the station intact.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T01:59:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/234c5ea9928169df75f5ca9b6fe50f2d.jpg", "website": "https://thezetaorbital.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Expat Pixel"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Expat Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
