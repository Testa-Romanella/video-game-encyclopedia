Kill the zombies.</strong><br/><br/>This is a playable but\u00a0unfinished prototype. Initially started as a Ludumdare 42 entry, but continued developing it for a while\u00a0after that.<br/><br/><strong>Things you CAN do:</strong><br/>\u2013Pick up items and use them.<br/>\u2013Break boxes to get new items.<br/>\u2013Manage your inventory, picking up and dropping items, since you can only carry two items at once. You can equip things like ammo even if you don't have any fire weapon at the time, to free up the slot.<br/>\u2013Kill zombies.<br/>\u2013Kill birds.<br/><br/><strong>Things you CAN'T do:</strong><br/>\u2013Find the key for the gas station, I didn't get to implement it.<br/>\u2013Get inside the gas station.<br/>\u2013Use the radio to attract zombies.<br/>\u2013Finish the level. After you kill all the zombies and test all the different items, there's nothing else to do.<br/><br/>I lost access to the project files, so this development\u00a0is on hiatus. I have no idea when I will be able to continue or even if I will. I'm focused on improving my skills and learning\u00a0to be able to\u00a0make better games. But I thought it would be cool if people could try this out and tell me if they liked it :)<br/><br/><strong>Known issues:</strong> The inventory system may break if you try to pick up two of the same item. The only solution to this is to restart the game.<br/><br/><strong>Thanks for playing!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e374fd4c0db6f96bff72d3f3117b4ebc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ittai Manero"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
