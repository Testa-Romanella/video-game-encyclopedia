One person cannot save nature, two people cannot save nature, ten people cannot either. So, would it be possible in some way for everyone to help save what we still have? This problem must take into account several other criteria, and this is what I have to show.</p>\n<p>Trees is a game that brings a cinematic experience about the relationship between nature and society, also talking about current environmental problems and human hypocrisy in the way we try to help find the solution. This game has the purpose of raising awareness and giving knowledge about environmental problems and how we can be willing to act. These effects were applied to me during the development of the game, now I hope that it will also apply to all those that this project is intended for.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\"Great principle that\u00a0nature made man happy and good, but that society depraves hum and makes him miserable.\"</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jean-Jaques Rosseau</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Walk</li><li>E: Interact</li><li>Alt + Enter: Switch between Full Screen and Window</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>A game by Ciro Fernandes (Cube Legal)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Instagram: @ciroricettinovaes</li><li>Contact email: cubeindustria@gmail.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T05:55:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/0946137c6934f477385eb685cd067256.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cube Legal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
