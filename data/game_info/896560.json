Denying a troll gives you money, of course, denying a non-troll will lead to salary cut.</p>\r\nLevel 2, aka the rising\r\n<p>Then came the start of the success, you have 6 screens, but trolls are getting more smart, they start to act a real person, and troll only after a while.</p>\r\nLevel 3, aka the Fake News era\r\n<p>Twitter is now getting more and more attention, and if there are still trolls, some people start to propagate fake news, they are not real trolls but tend to rewrite the reality. So take care to refute fake news...\u00a0</p>\r\nLevel 4, aka the takeover\r\n<p>Twitter was bought by Elon Musk, one of the main poster of the platform. In addition to your moderator job, you must print your work from the previous month if you don't want to get fired.</p>\n<p>Also, as he is the new owner, Elon Musk has the right to say whatever he wants, even trolling (of course, you will be blamed for letting a troll go public, but you would be more blamed to censor your boss).</p>\r\nLevel 5,\u00a0\r\n<p>For people still on board, it was a brief moment of back to normality before...</p>\r\nLevel 6, aka the microservices fiasco\r\n<p>In a big announcement, Elon Musk said that in order to optimise Twitter server, all unknown microservice will be dismissed after a while. Most people say it was the main reason for Twitter blackout. We just call it the end of the game.</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Main menu: insert credits with B, and start with A button, the more credits you put, the higher score you will start in the game</p>\n<p>Ingame: move your crusor with DPad and press A button to activate action on a screen (deny a tweet or read a mail)\u00a0or printer (print a sheet).</p>\n<p>Thanks you for playing this little game, I hope it gave you some minutes of fun.</p>\n<p>Usually all games from the LynxJam are packaged and sell without benefice on a real cartridge during spring. Check K-Retro and Yastuna Games\u00a0for previous years cartridges.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T22:21:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7dac53f1a81e431147ef0c615745fd96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Fadest"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
