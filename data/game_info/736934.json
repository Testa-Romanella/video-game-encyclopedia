Guessing the word in less than Par grants you full points, and a +1 to your streak.\u00a0 Going over Par resets your Streak, but not your Score. Doubling Par (that is, taking more than twice Par), will reset your Score back to 0.</p>\n<p>Similarly to golf, the lower below Par you get, the better your score will be. Additionally, the length of the word affects the amount of points you receive per score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you are playing in \"Semi-Merge\" mode (the default), where there is one letter in the\u00a0Guess Word not in either hints, you are provided the option to \"purchase\" these Unmatched words. If you do this, your points received will be cut in half for that round. Going over par also cuts your points in half.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:59:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18f/18f9c1ab84dbb94f2edae66aa1f07994.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SigmaTeaches"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
