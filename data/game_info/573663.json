You try to leave but all the doors leading to the outside world are locked and there is no way out. You notice that your key card has gone missing and you hope that it's in one of the rooms. You place your hopes in the fact that the key card will lead you to freedom, so you begin your search as you walk through the dimly lit hallways.\u00a0 Be careful as you search however, as someone or something is watching you. Stalking you. If it catches you, who knows what will happen. Good luck.</p>\n<p>This project was created as part of a second year university brief at the\u00a0University of South Wales, in association with\u00a0Tiny Rebel Games. The module brief was \"These are our fears\". Teams had to make games that were 8 to 10 minutes long, taking place in small environment that students frequently use, the theme of the game was student fears.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Development Team\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n</strong><strong>Game\u00a0Designers:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br/>Ieuan Williams - Lead Game Designer &amp; Mechanics Developer<br/>Andreas Stylianou - UI/UX Designer &amp; Mechanics Developer<br/>Chelsea Selmo - Level Designer &amp; Mechanics Developer<br/>Aaron Eady - AI Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Game Artists:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br/>Shannon Nicholls - Lead Game Artist &amp; Environmental Artist<br/>Alec Parker - Character Artist<br/>Jonas Autenrieth - Concept Artist &amp;\u00a0Environmental Artist<br/>Christopher Daniel - Environmental Artist</p>\n<p>With special thanks to Susan Cummings &amp;\u00a0Lee Cummings at\u00a0Tiny Rebel Games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find out more about the University of South Wales Games' courses at\u00a0http://southwales.ac.uk/games\u00a0and\u00a0http://www.twitter.com/uswgames\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T06:08:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f78/f78254908e65adfc7f4cb188b67901be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["USW Games", "Jonas Autenrieth", "ImmortalFox", "chelseasel", "AaronTEady", "Lithuenza_Azrangr", "Shannon_N"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
