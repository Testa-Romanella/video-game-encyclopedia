{"id": 977902, "slug": "space-survivor-3", "name": "Space Survivor", "name_original": "Space Survivor", "description": "This is a space-themed rogue-like game.<br/>You will pilot your spaceship facing a large and aggressive enemy fleet, growing stronger in battle. <br/>Upgrading your ship, recruiting crew members, hiring wingmen, and building space station defense systems will all help you better defend your space station.<h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li><h3>Spaceships</h3>Wide range of spaceships with different characteristics and strengths and weaknesses, different piloting, combat and strategy experiences;<br/><br/><br/></li><li><h3>Equipment</h3>Wide variety of weapons and components for different combat experiences.<br/><br/><br/></li><li><h3>Power</h3>Supply to the three main modules - WEAPON, SYSTEM, and ENGINE - directly affects the performance of systems such as weapon firing rate, propulsion speed, and recharge speed. You can adjust power distribution at any time or overclock a particular system to unleash extra performance.<br/><br/><br/></li><li><h3>Crew</h3>Crew members can help you operate weapons, repair the ship, optimize power systems, and pilot the ship, allowing them to assist you in combat and relieve you of some duties. <br/><br/>You're not alone.<br/><br/><br/></li><li><h3>Wingman</h3>Recruit wingmen from the space station to fight alongside you, building your defense fleet.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Investment</h3>There are multiple growth paths to invest in, but evenly distributing resources yields minimal results. Choosing the development path that suits you best is the optimal investment strategy.<br/></li><li><h3>Quick Gameplay</h3>Each session lasts 10-20 minutes, providing easy relaxation and nerve relief.</li></ul><h3>Some Words to Say</h3><br/>I am developing this game alone.<br/>I want to explore a real-time space combat style that is not dogfighting. The main focus and gameplay lie in managing crew assignments, allocating power to ship systems, and strategizing the use of the ship's advantages and disadvantages during battles. It doesn't rely on precise aiming or quick reflexes typical of dogfighting tactics.<br/>Currently, only some prototypes are completed, and there are many aspects left unfinished or unclear. I will continue to update and experiment with various ideas until satisfied. Launching in Early Access is to gauge community feedback and to motivate myself to persevere.<br/>This is a huge undertaking, and I have many cool ideas on my TODO LIST, but I have to take it one step at a time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T06:13:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/627/627c171fca0bc900bf90d79b77fb8eaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 433, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M329"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["M329"], "esrb_rating": null}
