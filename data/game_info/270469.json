Park-Boy", "description": "Yuu-Boy has crashed on earth and he needs YOUR help to get back home!\r\n<p>Heeey! Park-Boy is a casual simulation/adventure game heavily inspired by early 2000s era PS2/Gamecube titles like Chibi-Robo and Katamari Damacy.</p>\n<p>In it, you play as Yuu-Boy, an alien who's ship runs off happiness. Unfortunately for him he got a LITTLE too close to earth which caused his ship to crash! Oh, and did I forget to mention\u00a0Yuu-Boy is only 3 inches tall...</p>\n\n<p>After crashing in an abandoned park, Yuu-Boy must get home the only way he knows how- by making people happy! It's now your job to spruce up an old run down city park and return happiness to planet earth, one flower at a time!</p>\n<ul><li>Water flowers and make them dance by playing cheesy music on a keyboard</li><li>Buy and sell objects for your park and decorate it however you like</li><li>Buy upgrades to power up Yuu-Boy and\u00a0make him the greatest flower water-er of all time!</li><li>Unlock tools like\u00a0the legendary Park-Buggy and travel across your park in style</li></ul>\n\n<p>-PLEASE KEEP IN MIND-</p>\n<p><strong>This is a prototype</strong> and as such does NOT have an ending. Please water flowers and build items\u00a0as much as you like but be aware there is no ending to be discovered.... yet</p>\n<p>Everything in this\u00a0game was made in a month for the Indie Game Making Contest 2018 by me, Trey Brown.<br/></p>\n<p>Sorry about the audio skipping sometimes, I wasn't able to fix that bug before the contest deadline...</p>\n<p>This game <strong>DOES NOT</strong> have controller support yet! Sorry! In the mean time if you add the parkBoy.exe as a non-steam game and browse the community\u00a0steam controller bindings in big picture mode I have made an official set of key bindings to allow you to play the game with an Xbox controller.</p>\n<p>steam://controllerconfig/parkboy/1575865052<br/></p>\n<p>Also if you want to check out the soundtrack for whatever reason I made a playlist on Soundcloud. I also included a few tracks that went unused due to time.</p>\n<p>-Credits-<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to the friends and family that helped me playtest and gave me feedback, specifically my sister Ashley Brown and Finn Diedrichs Farnan</p>\n<p>Marcelo Magalh\u00e3es Pereira and Goma Shin for there fantastic free fonts that I used throughout this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fc/0fc2a8201fa31eb2d6a969ddb265ad83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trey Brown"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
