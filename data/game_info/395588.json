That was until the mountain decided it was time to remind Gary of the awesome power of nature. Gary is now in a life or death race to out run an avalanche. Using naturally occurring moguls to steady his decent he must walk a fine line between going fast enough to not be swallowed by the raging wall of snow behind him while not going so fast that he loses all control. Add to this a mix of trees and rocks he must avoid and its not looking good for Gary.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:24:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5af/5af4628a9232f29e871642ab118ede93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MoreDragons"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
