This game was made for Ludum Dare 29 with a few friends (AlucardX60 and MKSTAR26).</p>\n<p>Take control as some sort of minidrill whose goal is to defend a much <br/>larger drill from enemy attacks. That's pretty much it. Unless you want a<br/> story or something. Alright, heres a story. We originally planned for <br/>you to plant a bomb and blow up the earth, but because of time <br/>constraints we had to scrap that. We're serious, we finished with like <br/>10 minutes left. Our programmer really needs to stop being lazy.</p>\n<p>Use the Left mouse button, W, Up, or Space to move forward. The drill will move towards the mouse cursor.<br/></p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Attack enemy drills from behind, they turn slower.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul><li>Golems will throw rocks at you if you are close, try and draw their attention towards the walls.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul><li>When the minidrill respawns, you have temporary invincibility. Try to clear out as many enemies as possible in those 2 seconds.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d7/9d7852e305d9aad40eef4ed7284dee56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jellonator"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
