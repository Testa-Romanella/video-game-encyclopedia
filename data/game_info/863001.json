{"id": 863001, "slug": "stay-away-from-them", "name": "Stay Away From Them", "name_original": "Stay Away From Them", "description": "<p>Stay Away From Them is a  quick game/interactive fiction about a character alone in a park at night and being disturbed by an unknown guy. This was my first failure to finish a game for the Compo category in Ludum Dare, so I decided to polish it better and submit it to the Jam category (24 hours longer).</p>\n<p>I tried to recreate some visual feelings from old games (especially PSX-era). The resolution was intentionally reduced and the models were kept very simple.</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: There's a setting in the options menu to disable Strong Language from the game dialogues. The dialogue lines are really simple and it's not a big deal, but I decided to create this option if any people have any issues with swearing. The main theme of the game can be sensitive to some people too, but I guess it was not too developed in the gameplay (if you need, read more explanations below).</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse - Camera movement<br/>AWSD - Character movement</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Low poly models</li><li>Old aesthetic</li><li>No jump-scares</li><li>Sensitive Theme</li></ul>\n<p><strong># Assets/Tools</strong></p><strong>\n</strong>\n<p>All the assets are created during the game jam with open/free software (with exception of the fonts).</p>\n<ul><li>Game Engine: Godot</li><li>Code: GDScript/Godot</li><li>3D Models: Blender</li><li>Model Animations: Blender</li><li>Sounds: LMMS and Audacity</li><li>Textures: GIMP and Krita</li></ul><p>Font: November (by tepidmonkey)<br/></p>\n<strong>Game Objectives<br/></strong>\n<p>The main objective is to escape from the park before any \"masked man\"\u00a0 has the chance to catch you. This is not really hard, but I prefer that you try to figure it out by yourself.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game Theme</strong></p>\n<p>The theme is about being harassed by men in public places (in this case, a park). It was a really quick attempt to make something using a more sensitive theme. There are no references to the character genre (maybe some lines can suggest it) in the gameplay, so all the ambient is completely open.<br/></p>\n<p>Game Jam Theme</p>\n<p>The first idea was to invoke the LD51 theme (every 10 seconds) to make a game about something that happens often in the world (not necessarily every 10 seconds). But I actually don't know if this game can fit well with the theme, and as the only reference to it is the action/dialogues being played every 10 seconds, I decided to opt out of the theme category.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T18:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb625f0a5f105bb6da6c27cd148090b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["rvenson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
