This is a *very* small indie horror project created by\u00a0misterrider19\u00a0on fiverr and published by me, @Hayhouse_VT on twitter. This idea was something a friend of mine and I\u00a0came up with after seeing a meme and after some time it became this short game! (There are two endings to the game!) (about 4 mins gameplay tbh)<br/><br/>DONATIONS APPRECIATED! ANY PROFITS WILL GO TO WILDLIFE CHARITIES! The lesson in this game is to always be kind to the wildlife and they will be kind to you in return!<br/><br/>THE STORY:<br/>You have walked a while to your friend's house\u00a0and they were supposed to be home but their work had kept them. So you are stuck at the nearby pond as you wait for them to get home so you can crash there for the night. You enjoy a canned beverage on the bench by the pond as you wait, just be sure to clean up after yourself!<br/></p><p>(There are a few things broken, (no doors on the houses!) So just stick to the lit road to see your friend at the end of the road! There is also no interaction, just cutscene triggers, so when you reach a goal location a ending scene will play)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T15:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ef/4eff965420f41e7a41d6c445fdb4c0c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hayhouse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
