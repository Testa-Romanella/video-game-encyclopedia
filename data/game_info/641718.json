Galaxies and stars are violently pushed toward their home, threatening to destroy it and any nomads who get caught in their path. Survive rounds of relentless onslaught to secure survival of the nomads.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA game is played over several rounds. Each round a number of nomads try to make it back home. You must defend them by swinging intergalactic swords around, fire projectiles and reflect galaxies or stars back to their origin.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey features:<br/>\r\nCampaign spanning 60 missions. Missions increase in duration and difficulty.<br/>\r\nRandom Game - Experience a random encounter in the imploding 'verse.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSimplistic Controls:<br/>\r\nThe game is fully played with a mouse. A huge sword is attached to each nomad and another one to their home. Each sword points to the mouse cursor. LMB reflects hazards which are adjacent to any sword. RMB shoots a projectile from every sword toward the position of the mouse cursor. Hazards which collide with a sword are destroyed if not reflected.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHazards:<br/>\r\nThere are numerous types of hazards, each requiring a different approach. Some hazards go for home directly, some attack nomads on multiple vectors. Usually either tile or bullet hell mechanics make a round. However boss rounds might mix and match mechanics or even add new ones to challenge you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T02:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f0/8f01972d41fd4349a6fbb162213581ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chocolate Ship Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chocolate Ship Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
