The call for The Golden Heart. An artifact that had long lost it's use to modern civilization, and hence had been lost for a long, long, long, time.<br/></p>\n<p>That was until Blubird heard it.</p>\n<p>The call.</p>\n<p>The Golden Heart had cried. A last attempt to get someone to hear it.</p>\n<p>and it worked.</p>\n<p>Blubird woke up in his house in a fright from the dream he received about the Golden Heart calling out to him. He quickly rushed out his door. (after taking a long look at everything, of course) Blu shook off the call. It didn't have meaning, right? However, something stuck him as odd.</p>\n\n<p>This game is a lot different for your normal RPG Maker games, I mean, first of all, it runs on 2003, (because I'm poor) but it also has a lot of unique ideas and story ark-ing, some positives that are in the game:<br/>-A memory based skill system<br/>-a full party of 4<br/>-Each character having a unique personality and story,</p>\n<p>-an art style that mimics the MOTHER series</p>\n<p>-8-bit soundtrack custom made by Coolblubird himself (and my assistant TnTDude7)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-And some pretty good references\u00a0</p>\n<p>oh yeah and we have a discord\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>Ok, are they gone now? Nice! Back to work!</p>\n\n<p>-and maybe a sequel in the works...... hint hint</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T05:19:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e0/0e00eef674da83b268029af51c1031ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coolblubird"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
