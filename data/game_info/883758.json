From there, you can select a different zone to play through. There are 2 ZONES in the demo, Tropical Resort AND Starlight Carnival. For the demo, there are ONLY 2 acts in each zone. Acts 3/4/5 won't unlock no matter what you do!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T11:01:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/332/332af2c40ebc49b9981dafe2b503eedc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Randomocity Gaming"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
