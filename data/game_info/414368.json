You know what's waiting for you outside.\u00a0 Your last friend is your old trusted lantern and the possibility to run.<br/><br/>Last in the dark is a prototype of a hide and seek stealth game. The idea is, the player has to collect food and can move fast and loud or snkeaky and slow. The enemies around you are patroling and start to chasing you, if you are too close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We couldn't finish all desired functionalities at the moment. Now you can move around (WASD, SHIFT for sprinting), collecting food with (HOLDING) E and rotate the lantern with the mouse. And... you are not alone on the map :)<br/></p>\n<p>The goal is to collect food and return to one of the manholes on the map, pressing E. <br/></p>\n<p>Press \"Any Key\" in the start-menu.<br/></p>\n\n<p>All sound-effects were bought via humble bundle and are allowed to use.</p>\n<p>Improvements / goals for the future:</p>\n<ul><li>improve FOV and fix light-issues</li><li>enemies can smell the player </li><li>enemies can hear the player (player is running)</li><li>post-processing-effects</li><li>more enemies, more levels</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:33:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/658f737150e19df4edc932821d10c181.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxieB", "Leif-Eric"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
