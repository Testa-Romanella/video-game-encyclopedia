After watching TV shows like\u00a0<em>Oz</em>, I always felt there was a place for a gritty, character-driven simulation of life behind bars. Here, the drudgery of it was embraced to create a tense survival sim - where you had to eat and sleep amidst a backdrop of constant violence without losing your mind! The wrestling games had given me a good pedigree in trash talking and gang violence, so this was the same thing transplanted to a different setting. The \"turn and advance\" controls weren't ideal compared to what would follow in later 3D adventures, but it was a step in the right direction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:12:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5d/d5d31b4c0c6a2f35a651373b3fb18d30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MDickie"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
