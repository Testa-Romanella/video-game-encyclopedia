Guilt, trauma, anger, and sadness can all be devastating to the human psyche and will allow for unspeakable things to happen thereafter. The complexities of these emotions often weigh down on our conscious, and oftentimes they can be volatile if left unchecked. The game is an extreme case where these emotions seep into reality and create a horrifying setting where the lines are further blurred between real and unreal. \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T12:26:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/671b5f2474310cbaab3b140cdd6c9152.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jazkiacar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
