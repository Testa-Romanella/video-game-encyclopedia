You seem to have waken up in a glitched world. It is dim, dull, and very sad. Your throat is dry. You look around. A small village surrounds you, a horrible dust storm is going on. Behind you is a glowing red portal. What do you do in this distorted world?</p>\n<p>This game is an HD version of my game Dark Land.\u00a0This game takes up more space than the original does, which defeats the purpose of me making the smallest file sized game I could make,\u00a0but if you want better graphics, this one is recommended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T05:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c16/c1642f7f573b86bbd60ed0f8ba7f63fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iMakeStuffSC"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
