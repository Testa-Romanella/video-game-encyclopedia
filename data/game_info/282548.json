The game itself is pretty simple: your Enjoyment(Health) will decrease gradually, and your energy will increase.\u00a0You can gain enjoyment by\u00a0shooting lightning on men or heart on women, which will cost some energy. There are some bosses who are from ancient greek myth, and they will interact with heart or lightning differently.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the idea I was trying to achieve?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Zeus is a great character for video games in general, simply just because of his thunderbolt. As a result, Zeus also appears in some games that aren't really mythology related. Most of games simply give the character a strong look and ability to use lightning bolt, which is cool but doesn't really show the personality and characteristic of Zeus in its origin, except for his extraordinary power.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My goal is to show Zeus's lust and cruelty in a simple game. Some games achieve that by providing a story line or dialogue for him, but I want put those aspects in the game's basic mechanics, and that's how this game was made.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse Left/Right Click to shoot Lightning/Heart on that direction.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b36/b36be9165705e6ff40419e0cbe9a69db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["compasslg"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
