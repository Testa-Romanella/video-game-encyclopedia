Its huge star <strong>Naidira </strong>is becoming increasingly unstable. Realizing that it is\u00a0only a matter of time before an apocalyptic hypernova explosion destroys their entire planet <strong>Hadea</strong>, the <strong>Scynthians </strong>devise a plan to escape their world and rebuild their civilization elsewhere in the galaxy.
