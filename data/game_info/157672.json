You need to match balloons by colors by dragging them next to each other. When you match three of them (or four, by connecting two double balloons), they pop up and disappear from the screen. <br/><br/>Manage your space carefully! If balloons of different colors touch, you lose a life! When a balloon approaches the top of the screen, you need to drag it down so it doesn't fly off. Drag balloons around to make way for matching. <br/><br/>Use the power-ups: dart, slow time and fan to survive longer.<br/><br/>\u2022 Single and easy-to-learn controls<br/>\u2022 Intuitive gameplay<br/>\u2022 Kid-friendly<br/>\u2022 Power ups<br/>\u2022 3 levels of difficulty</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a34/a347ef3f5cfa757a3a9fb8373e887fec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lynx Animation"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
