{"id": 686057, "slug": "tabletop-labyrinth", "name": "Tabletop Labyrinth", "name_original": "Tabletop Labyrinth", "description": "<p>Tabletop Labyrinth is a mix of Roguelike and Card game, where your goal is to find a key and get out of the dungeon.</p>\n<p>Plan your moves, use movement points wisely, but most importantly.. do not starve.</p>\n\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\nEarly Beta Version\r\n<p>This game was made in 10 days, so expect bugs and glitches. It's far from being done, but i work as much as i can to make it better and update it frequently. Want to encourage me - feel free to drop a donation! :)</p>\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nExplore, Loot, Survive\r\n<p>Do not get distracted, one wrong step and you're out. Snakes and rats are not your biggest enemy here, it's hunger. Explore the labyrinth and face a real hunger game. Mobs will sometimes drop you a portion of food, and it's worth checking corners in labyrinth to refill your supplies.</p>\r\nStrategy Card Roguelike\r\n<p>You start with five cards on your hand. Feel free to swap these you think aren't useful at the moment. Some cards are free, some cost movement points to use. Once you have them in hand, it's up to you how you're gonna play them. Also don't forget that <em>you can only have seven cards in hand at one time</em>. Trying to loot with full hand will result in wasted loot.</p>\r\nMovement points\r\n<p>This is most important stat after health and food. On first turn you have whole ten points to spend, after that you'll only get 3 points per turn. Movement points can be used to navigate around the map or play some badass cards. You can also play a swiftness/haste/adrenaline cards to get from +1 to +3 movement points per card.</p>\r\nStatuses\r\n<p>Burn, inflict bleeding and stun enemies. Perfect combos will always save you from a bad situation. Plan your movements, do not throw random cards around, you might need these in a minute or two.</p>\n\r\nWant to talk or check out other things i do?\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0Discord</li><li>\u00a0YouTube</li><li>\u00a0Reddit</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Android version will be available in Google Play soon</p>\n<p>Gameplay video:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T09:23:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/156/1560c17ca2578b2d840f8548ffa30e7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Evangeder"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
