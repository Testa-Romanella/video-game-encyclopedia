Featuring all 18 characters of AUTONOMY and more, the second entry to the TRACHI series aims to combine ruthless storytelling with relentless gameplay experiences. <br/><br/><h3>ANARCHY provides.</h3>Each of the <strong>four Acts</strong> portrays a shared struggle from a different point of view. For the first act \u2013 <strong>PARADISE</strong>, a girl named <strong>Lorna</strong> takes the centre stage. Driven by a deep desire to talk to someone special, she's set her mind to put things right \u2013 and smash the status quo.<h3>A world too good to be true</h3>Step by step, memories of a shattered world return. Eventually, facts become impossible to deny. And with that, each character has to come to terms with both their identity and history. All of it pointing to a single question: Whether to forgive, or to forget again.<br/><br/><h3>Ad infinitum</h3>Without death, there's always a second chance. There is no Game Over, because the game never ends. Even shattering defeats drive progression forward, as both the characters and their experience always return to life. To try and try again.<h3>Survival of the fittest</h3> Unless one day, the flames go out. And without fire, death is permanent. If you're willing to risk it all, a special mode \u2013 <strong>ECSTASY</strong> \u2013 awaits. So that you, as well, can prove your immortality.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-01T03:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/874b8e24df6115546499df0297ab9d8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nory"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nory"], "esrb_rating": null}
