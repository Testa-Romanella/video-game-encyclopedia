It's corruption spews from it like a dragons breath. Anyone who dwells too close too it usually dies a horrible death, or is the cause of one.</p>\n<p>Yet the shadow it emits has caused things not to just be lost to it, but emerge from it's depths. The closest settlements have reported sights of dark creatures lurking the edge of their villages. Not only that, the residents there have been turning to dark things. Black magic, slavery, murder. What once used to be blossoming villages have turned to wastelands of crime.</p>\n<p>Your liege has tasked you with putting down this, this, thing. What ever it may be. If it goes deep into the mountain you must not stop until it is kill or caught. Do not fail us knights.</p>\n<p>### Gameplay Goals:</p>\n<p>Take on a fellowship of knights, to cure the lands of corruption. You will have three knights as you delve deep into the mountain to find the source of this madness.</p>\n<p>### Morals and Morale:</p>\n<p>As the corruption eats at your knights souls, they will be tested. Not only in combat, but the ways of mind, body, and flesh. Hold your knights together, with stories and their faith of choice. Choose your tenets wisely.</p>\n<p>Fail and well. It won't be pretty.</p>\n<p>### Combat:</p>\n<p>Your mettle will be tested with a wide variety of enemies, of corrupted nature. The wildlife and humans that the corruption has chained in the mountain will test your combat ability. The combat will be intense with real-time action with pause (to catch your breath when the going gets rough). Position your knights on the battlefield engaging enemies and defending your fellows. Unleash spells, spears, and other weapons at your enemies.</p>\n<p>### Kit</p>\n<p>Your knights will come ready for combat, but the corrupted depths have some surprisingly good loot. Be careful though, Not all are what they seem.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:02:38", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Niyy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
