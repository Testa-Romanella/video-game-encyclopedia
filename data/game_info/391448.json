All of the game assets were created by the group with the feedback of peers and mentors. 9LH\u00a0 was programmed in Game Maker Studio 2, over a period of part-time development in a single\u00a0 month. The intended design of 9LH is to be challenging and fast paced with quick feedback to the player, as well as acquiring upgrades when you defeat the bosses and earning local based highscores through speed-running the game..</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem requirements:\r\n<ul><li>OS:\u00a0Windows: 7, 8 and 10.</li><li>Processor: 2GHz</li><li>Memory: 2GB</li><li>DirectX 11</li><li>Storage space: 5MB</li></ul>\r\n\r\nGet in touch:\r\nEmail:\u00a0rampilowreal@gmail.com\u00a0<br/><br/>YouTube:\u00a0RampilowGames<br/><br/>Twitter:\u00a0@ZS_Ramp\r\n<br/><br/>Anywhere else: Rampilow\r\nInstall instructions\r\nTo download and install 9LH:\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong><strong>\u00a0Download the 9LH.zip file from Itch.io.<br/>2.
