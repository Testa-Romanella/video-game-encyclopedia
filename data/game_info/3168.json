{"id": 3168, "slug": "soma", "name": "SOMA", "name_original": "SOMA", "description": "<p>SOMA is a sci-fi survival horror that makes you rethink the description of death. You play as Simon Jarrett who was injured in a crash accident and agreed for an experimental operation on his brain. He wakes up at an abandoned underwater facility full of mutants. Trying to figure out what\u2019s going on, Simon finds Catherine Chun, a scientist, who tells him about the technology of copying the human personality.<br />\nThe gameplay is based on exploration and puzzle solving. There&#39;s no combat, and you are meant to avoid enemies and act stealthily. To progress through the story, you need to search for clues, read multiple notes and solve puzzles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br />\nThough there are monsters in SOMA, it frightens with its atmosphere in the first place. A dark, abandoned station with dead people, uncertainty and the lack of any understanding of what is waiting for you is scarier than screamers and blood rivers. Moral choices you have to make don\u2019t affect the story much: instead, they change your attitude to the events, so it\u2019s you who develops through the game.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2015-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T17:50:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/149/149bbed9d90dc09328ba79bbacfda3c8.jpg", "website": "http://www.somagame.com", "rating": 4.16, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 703, "owned": 4634, "beaten": 1008, "toplay": 301, "dropped": 325, "playing": 57}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 1383, "suggestions_count": 484, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1398, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Frictional Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Frictional Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
