Water and grow plants, combine items and make sure you give the correct pigeon the item in order to fulfill the clients requests.<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/>Shadowbunnie<br/><br/><br/>Dear Apothecary is a single player, casual, simulator-esque game. You will take on the role of the community Apothecary while you raise the funds necessary for medical school. Clients within the community will send their requests by pigeon courier and pick up their request with the same pigeon. Send the remedy to the wrong person, or not at all, and you aren't getting paid. Although, not everyone should have the correct item sent to them if they aren't trustworthy. You can learn about the clientele, ingredients and learn the recipes through the various almanacs within your place of work and it is encouraged that you do so.  <br/><br/>Many hours of time period research has went into this game as I wanted all of the remedies to be based off of medical knowledge in the time period either by using actual recipes or a rendition of them.
