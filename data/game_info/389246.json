Crawler zombies can climb walls and jump on you, boomer zombies self-detonate, shade zombies can move through walls and charge, giant zombies can throw corpses!<br/><br/>Now has full controller support (but has a glitch where you may need to restart the game a couple times before the controller work (work in progress)).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T03:49:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26c96eb8e24474e1f57e3fb0441dcaf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ravinia"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
