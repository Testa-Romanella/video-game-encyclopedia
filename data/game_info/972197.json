{"id": 972197, "slug": "microcivilization", "name": "Microcivilization", "name_original": "Microcivilization", "description": "In Microcivilization you explore, expand, exploit and exterminate all together in a pixel-art strategy-clicker game blend. Start the non-linear growth of your population and economical strength while discovering government combinations, hundreds of unique heroes and experimenting with ability builds for both combat and construction challenges.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You have many ways to build an obscenely rich and powerful nation. If oppressing your people by furious button smashing is your thing, master the clicker features to your benefit. If faith in your micro-people's good-will and productivity is your style, make use of your workshops and their passive and active abilities. Advancing in technology tree will unlock upgrades, military units, bonuses and new abilities to help you grow and steel yourself for threats to come.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Face hundreds of disasters, wars, diseases, social unrests, invasions and independence declarations that threaten your people. Sometimes you will get beaten, descend into dark ages, famine or ideological mayhem. But have no fear, losing is impossible. In fact, the harder the struggle, the more likely a grand hero emerges from the ashes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every crisis you overcome gives you a chance to gain a hero. For your micro-civilization heroes act as inventory items  which boost your power. Though you can only have a handful of them equipped at any time, collecting heroes opens endless new effects on your industry, wealth, strength and stability. As you move forward, you will collect higher tiers of heroes, merge them with recipes and form sets to gain absurd powers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Disasters in this game are no mere random number generator roll. You are in full control of all disaster risks. In fact you know the chance of them happening at any given time so you have chance to mitigate. Uninhabited houses? Chance of fire. Too many people crammed in tight space? Small-pox will probably visit you soon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whether by bad luck, or your risk neglection, when a crisis occurs it can be overcome by combat. Fire can be extinguished, disease can be withstood or cured, invasion can be repelled. Regardless of what the problem is, it is always a number of brave micro-people willing to give their lives, who defeat the crisis. In every fight, People are your life, Economy is your strength and Heroes are your weapons. Combine these with workshop abilities and master the combat to become a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>History has too many stories to tell in one go. In order to reach the metaphorical stars, you will need to trace back to ancient ages several times, each with a higher purpose. Your Ascension tree contains many challenges organized into Difficulty Tiers each brining new features into the game, more difficult enemies but also access to more powerful heroes, world wonders and ability modifications.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-15T21:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/315/31558f7597d6a34c4e185d9d408a3a13.jpg", "website": "https://ohomola.net/microcivilization/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ondrej Homola"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ondrej Homola"], "esrb_rating": null}
