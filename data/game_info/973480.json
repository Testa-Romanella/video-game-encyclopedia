Whether you want to play casually or actively, this game will keep you hooked!<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Two ways to actively mine with your ship: Use drills or lasers to mine asteroids of different types and sizes. Drills are cheaper and always get the full mining amount, but you have to chase down the asteroids. Lasers are more expensive and have diminishing returns over distance, but you're not chasing the asteroids. Choose your strategy wisely!<br/></li><li>Upgrade your ship: Sell the resources you gather for gold, and use the gold to buy upgrades that increase your mining speed and cargo capacity. <br/></li><li> Perform research using gathered resources to unlock technological advancements to improve your equipment.<br/></li><li>Feel like idling? Buy <strong>AutoMiners</strong> to gather ore for you in the background. They'll collect ore even while the rest of the game is paused. Buy <strong>Merchants</strong> (auto-sellers) to sell selected inventory for you automatically! Cha-ching!<br/></li><li>Prefer a more entertaining method of idle mining? Buy <strong>Mining Drones</strong> that will fly around and mine the asteroids for you. Such a spectacular performance to behold! <br/></li><li> There are also <strong>Player placeable Laser Mining Turrets</strong>, for all your Frickin Laser needs.<br/></li><li>Increase your <strong>Reputation</strong> (prestige) to earn gold even faster!<br/></li><li>Explore Space: Encounter various events and zones that may reward you, challenge you, or screw you over.
