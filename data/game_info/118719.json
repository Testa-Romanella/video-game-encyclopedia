You must kill Thoth's minions to draw additional cards to your hands. If your hand's value goes over 21 then that hand has BUST and will be disabled. This will automatically move your current hand to the next hand of cards. </p><p>You can press E to HOLD a hand which will prevent cards from being added to that hand and will switch to the next hand of cards. Once all 3 hands have either been BUST or HELD then the hands that you HELD will be compared to Thoth's. All hands that are higher in value than Thoth's cause additional benefits for the player. </p><p>Thoth is invulnerable until the hands have been revealed.</p><ul><li>If you have 0 winning hands then Thoth will rain down beams of light at random locations which you would need to avoid. </li><li>If you have 1 winning hand then Thoth will shoot a laser from his crown in a horizontal motion, you also deal 5 times damage to it. </li><li>If you have 2 winning hands then Thoth will do a series of slam attacks in front of it, you also deal 10 times damage to it.</li><li>If you have 3 winning hands then Thoth will be stunned for a short duration allowing you free reign to attack it, you also deal 20 times damage to it.</li></ul>edit: updated to support various screen sizes", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30d63d418380ce8088510adcf39d9bb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ouroborosgames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
