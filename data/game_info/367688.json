For PC users I recommend BGB Emulator and have included a config file in the folder for the best set up for the game. If you can run a GB/ GBC emulator on it you can run Deadeus on it, during development it has been played on a PC, Mac, PSVita, GB, GBC, Android and even a Nintendo Switch<br />\nThe game is also playable on an original Gameboy using a flashcart or other emulation cartridge.<br />\nSpecial Edition<br />\nThe special edition of Deadeus will come with a whole folder full of concept art, process work and desktop wallpapers\u00a0as well as a map to help you get around the world AND some sneaky peeks at what is to come in the future of Deadeus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-09T12:52:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a0/3a044d0356112208882e2ed0a97e9dc8.jpg", "website": "https://incube8games.com/products/deadeus-gb-digital-edition?_pos=1&_psq=dea&_ss=e&_v=1.0", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Game Boy", "PC"], "developers": ["-IZMA-"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
