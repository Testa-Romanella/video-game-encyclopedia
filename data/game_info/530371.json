{"id": 530371, "slug": "river-rescue-itch", "name": "River Rescue (itch)", "name_original": "River Rescue (itch)", "description": "<p>River Rescue is a\u00a0 makeover of the original ZX Spctrum game written by Phil Snell and published by Thorn EMI Video in 1984.</p>\n<p>The game is easy to play but difficult to master. Navigate your speedboat along the river avoiding or destroying the various hazards. Land at a jetty on the North bank and rescue a scientist. Further down the river land at the South bank and your scientist will scurry off to safety. Dare you gamble and carry more than one scientist at a time? One false move and\u00a0 they'll all end up in that big laboratory in the sky!</p>\n<p>Everything from the Spectrum is here - the crocs, the logs,\u00a0 the islands, the planes and even that little \"Speed up\" bonus, plus a few more surprises along the way.</p>\n<p>I decided I needed to finally make the jump from GameMaker 1.4 to GameMaker 2 and needed a fairly simple game to ease me in.\u00a0\u00a0 This was a game I loved all those years ago and seemed perfect. Download if you're a ZX Spectrum / Retro freak or if you just enjoy good old-fashioned pick-up-and-play action games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T10:27:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5350df3c2fe465100d686af1d0f1e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Langford Productions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
