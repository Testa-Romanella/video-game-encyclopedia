The theme was Shapeshift. Which is why the main thing in this game is to transform yourself into either Red, Green or Blue.The goal of the game is to escape the world of only RGB colors into the 3D world. The story isn't really that deep at all and is kind of an after thought as i focused all my time on the \"main\" mechanics.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou change your color with the shift buttons! And the black color is safe.\r\n</p><p>Rate it here!</p><p>\r\n\tMusic by: Studio Thumpy Puppy, Everything else was made by me in under 48 hours.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e9/5e9a8770a145c3063bc89cc43ef9118d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["David Styrbj\u00f6rn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
