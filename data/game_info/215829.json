Robotic Vectors is a pseudo-platformer in which you use robots as your means of transportation across the environment. Can you beat all six levels?</p>\n<p>Robotic Vectors was a solo project made in 48 hours, for the second GMTK Game Jam. The theme was <strong>GENRE, but you can't MECHANIC</strong>: a game that fits a genre, but is missing a staple mechanic from that genre. Robotic Vectors is a platformer, but the player has <em>no control over their movement input</em>, not being able to move, jump etc. when they please.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b16b8a767ee39e549c30e5779a53eeb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nuclear Applejack"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
