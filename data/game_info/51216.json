Before buying a product, you should always ask yourself: \"Am I enabling bigotry by giving money to these people?\" Sadly, humanity still hasn't acquired the intellectual maturity to realize that no one should be able to freely spend \"their\" money as they wish, but rather there should be a central authority preventing hateful people to be paid and prosper. Thus, as long as we live in this anarchic capitalistic regime, it's up to each one of us and to our moral conscience to be mindful of how we use our money. If you see a game you like on Steam, consider buying our game instead so that you can support an all-female game studio!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cf/1cf062339e72a92c800b2697e3be96a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["GoGirl Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GoGirl Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
