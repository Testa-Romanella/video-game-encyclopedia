Players take turns drawing lines and trying to capture the majority of cells on the grid. A cell is captured when the player draws the last of the four lines required to complete its borders. The player that captures a cell then gets another turn to draw the next line. Easy, right? :)\u2028\u2028 In this game you play against computer. <br/>To make the game more challenging,  you can change the size of the grid or choose how smart your computer opponent should be.\u2028\u2028 That's it!
