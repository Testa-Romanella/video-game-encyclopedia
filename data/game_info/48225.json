The rules are simple: you see a figure on the screen made up of several matches, but it\u2019s not perfect. Move, remove or add matches\u2026 and voila! The figure is complete (don\u2019t leave unused matches though).<br/><br/>Some problems will be surprisingly easy, and some will require an elegant solution. Most levels can be completed in a number of ways (solutions different from suggested ones are also accepted). <br/>Hints can be accessed by clicking the \u201cSolution\u201d button in the menu.<br/><br/>We hope you will enjoy the puzzles just as we enjoyed creating them for the game. <br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>SUPPORT<br/><br/>Our Google+: http://goo.gl/Xxeb8<br/>Our Facebook profile: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Celtic-Spear/290643634305314", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T14:10:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6dc2053933cb3bcf61c72a3c08e72b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Celtic Spear"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
