More than 200 handcrafted mazes.<br/>Hours of fun.<br/><br/>For those of us who just can&amp;#39;t get enough of maze games, MagMaze will provide thrills and entertainment for hours at a time. There are more than 200 mazes of various shapes and sizes; mazes like you&amp;#39;ve never seen on the iPhone. With MagMaze, easy gameplay lets you simply change the floor color, one square at a time or maybe collect stars while avoiding enemies. Stay alert though because you leave a trail that bad guys will follow.<br/><br/>There are 5 basic game modes we think you&amp;#39;ll love:<br/>1- Get Away - Paint all maze floor tiles while avoiding the baddies.<br/>2- The Chase - Simply grab all stars, flags or flowers scattered throughout the maze while staying clear of the enemies on your trail.<br/>3- Squash&amp;#39;em - To win in this mode, mercilessly squash all the harmless bugs (hello...they&amp;#39;re bugs!) while avoiding the less friendly type.<br/>4- Star Search - Collect the stars from all over the maze; just you against the clock.<br/>5- Get Out - Find and reach the exit portal and warp over to the next maze.<br/><br/><br/>There are 4 user-selectable graphics sets; to suit whatever mood you&amp;#39;re in.<br/>4 difficulty levels give you a lot to choose from, including a no-fail mode for children or maybe even adults, looking for a bit of easy fun.<br/>Pick between predetermined or cool, randomly generated one-of-a-kind mazes for a new experience each time.<br/>Game control is simple and intuitive.
