These heroes were the HotDogs.</p><p>As years went by, more and more HotDog Heroes showed up to help the city. Until there were so many heroes that this became a problem. They abused their powers and started to believe they had come to the city to become its new rulers.</p><p>Before that happens, the Pizza townsfolk decided it was time to unite and overthrow these formerly called heroes into the fauces of the Big Eater. This way they'll learn not to abuse their powers and not to mess with the Pizzas!</p><p>Game made for the A Game By It's Cover 2015 by Burnt Tongue Team.</p><p>https://twitter.com/burnttongueteam <br/></p><p>https://burnttongueteam.wordpress.com/</p>Members:<p>Production &amp; Sound -<strong> </strong>Laura Tort \u2013 LinkedIn</p><p>Design - Angel Maldonado \u2013 LinkedIn</p><p>Programmer -<strong> </strong>Jaume Fabrega \u2013 LinkedIn</p><p>Programmer - Francesc Pera \u2013 LinkedIn</p><p>Art -<strong> </strong>Joan Centellas \u2013 LinkedIn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8abcae53206e118587221956783031e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joancenjim"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
