The  smaller the gap the better the score. Left/right buttons move the left  paddle in that direction and the right in the opposite direction. The Z  button drops the block and you can also use the X button to pause the  game but I might remove this. The block reduces in size each time you  are successful and the game speeds up once you get through all size of  block.\r\n </p>\n<p>I'd like to add menus, a level select with how well you've done in each level and maybe some music.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T14:55:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc2/fc2a6d9f030a5c74bb61153973685aef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["anefiox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
