You can decide to keep artifacts for your collection or sell them even further, or get even better equipment.<br/><br/>The treasure hunter is not a simulator of the metal detector as such, but rather a combination of arcade and simulation. Thanks to streamlined detector mechanics, the game is pleasant not only to fans of the genre, but also to casual gamers. Simple, intuitive elements of gameplay in combination with beautiful landscapes create a truly pleasant experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T17:27:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e15d25ab44e8398b4288002f1c48a7a.jpg", "website": "http://vk.com/darkplaygame", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ruslan Visaitov"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Ruslan Visaitov"], "esrb_rating": null}
