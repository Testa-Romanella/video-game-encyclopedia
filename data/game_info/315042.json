This is about a purple knight named Kommander Kork. He revels in the slaying of the teal knights, his sworn enemies. The reason why is how he gets stronger, his blade more powerful, the more health he has. He gains the health of his enemies as he slays them, traveling into the teal knight fortress. Once he is in the core of the base, there is no telling what he could do. Guide him using WASD, with space to jump, and the mouse to hit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a81ea21042055e08b910f8d02bee76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kiveloctiy"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
