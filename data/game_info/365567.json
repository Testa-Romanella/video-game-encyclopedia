So I wasn't able to do what I wanted to do, but I'm going to prepare so hard for the next Jam.</p>\n<p>It was going to be a 4-player co-op game where you play as \"Super-Duper Food.\" Food that is way more nutritious than normal food, but rots away within seconds if not properly contained.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game was going to be to clear a pathway to the shopping basket and get in while at your \"freshest.\" Each player would have a limited amount of lives and would have a timer put on them whenever they left their spawning area. Once the timer ran out, the player would \"rot away\" (die) and respawn back at their starting position.</p>\n<p>To beat the level, the players would need to accumulate a minimum numbered score, this would be determined by factors such as: how many players made it to the basket, how much time was left on their current live's timer, how much time was left from the shared time to beat the level, etc.</p>\n\n<p>But, since I was inexperienced and had to work almost every day of the Jam, I wasn't able to implement any of what I needed to make a functional game.</p>\n<p>I was able to setup four players and a camera that calculates the distance between the furthest players and adjusts accordingly so that everyone is in its view. But that was it.</p>\n\n<p>I am proud of what I was able to create in the limited amount of time I had, and it will definitly not deter me from participating in the next Game Jam. It is time to wise up, and stand at my desk for the next few months learning the engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T07:44:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07a7c42fb43d5960fb4dad6a69a2fc80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MultipleCrane9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
