This game is played in a magic school called Hawk Woods. The protagonist is a couple composed of a cat and a dog. Due to a conflict, they decide to compete through the unique \"Dice Game\" of the magic school.</p>\n<p>Rules of Dice Game:</p>\n<p>The game begins with the two sides throwing nine dice on the grid, generating different terrains based on the results.</p>\n<p>Each terrain has different HP and skills, and the victory condition of players is to destroy each other's 6 terrains. The way to attack the opponent's terrain is through dice. Players first select the area they want to cast and roll dice. After getting points, players can adjust the direction and position of casting dice, causing damage to different areas.</p>\n<p>Players can heal their terrains in the same way.</p>\n<p>Players need to plan the location of their dice during the game. For example, if you want to attack the dice in the center, it is easier to cause damage from the four corners.</p>\n<p>Come and Roll the dice! Good luck!</p>\n<p>Special thanks for Junge and Joyce\u2019s translation.</p>\n<p>BGM:</p>\n<p>1. Paris Gipsy Swing by dierervanderwesten from https://freemusicarchive.org/</p>\n<p>2.
