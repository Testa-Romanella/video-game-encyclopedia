Navigate the puzzles using only your hearing! To give a little backstory to the project, this was originally a concept I had tried to create in GameMaker, however the audio was not as streamlined as I found it was in Unity3D \u2013 hence my use of UNity for this project!</p><p>This one won't see any more development, but may inspire a future, larger project of mine. Comments are appreciated!</p><p>A note that I don't have a good way to test the windows version at the moment, so if there are any issues using it, please leave a comment and I'll look into it as soon as possible!</p><p>Sounds I did not create can be found at  these  links.<br/>The song is Fretless by Kevin MacLeod.</p><p><strong>\"Fretless\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb2/eb2324f38b0948d0e85d61969e900245.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pioneer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
