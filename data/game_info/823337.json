This game is about a little duck named Trouble that finds himself without his mother and plays around on a sidewalk. The duck can wander around using the W A S D keys. When the duck steps on different objects it will trigger a sound effect and a simple 2-D partial effect.\u00a0<br/><br/>For this project I did all the coding, artwork, and sound effects. I retrieved the music from a free online library.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T22:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaf/aafa0a51741b6afa3395b2e93953b76a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jessica R.
