{"id": 168219, "slug": "mfpsp-test_1", "name": "MFPSP Test_1", "name_original": "MFPSP Test_1", "description": "Welcome and thanks for checking our this page! There'll be some information about this 'game' below.\r\n<p>So, you've come here looking for some description about what this is? Well, you're in the right spot! <br/></p>\n<p>It's a FPS where you can shoot other players, kill them and all that other good FPS stuff. I'm kinda lying there, it's what it is supposed to become. Currently this is, as the name suggests, for testing purposes, and while it has some FPS elements, it's far from finished.</p>\n<p>The reason of uploading this is to get some feedback from players about how things are handled and to see if there are bugs that occur. So, what can I do then? The player (yes, that is you!) can create or join a server in which you can play with your friends or other random players (Think of it like the CS:GO community browser).</p>\n<p>There's currently only one map, which isn't fancy but does the job for now. I highly recommend that if you're going to check it out to bring some friends as playing alone isn't all that great (sad face).</p>\n<p>Also, since this is currently only released to test multiplayer components, the sounds have been disabled as these might cause high network traffic and will be enabled later after testing.</p>\n<p>If you've come this far after reading the (somewhat strange) description, you have my thanks. Should you have any feedback or want to report a bug you can do so by sending an e-mail to ScarrDevvi@gmail.com or leaving a comment.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/820/820b7100355df6b327cb439cd4ec8c54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stekkerdoos"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
