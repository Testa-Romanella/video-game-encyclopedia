Only one fisherman can come out on top and claim the fjords for his nation, but in what nation\u2019s honor will you raise your sail? And do you have what it takes to prevail over your opposition? Duke it out with your friends in a high octane party game/battle royale for 2-4 people, where only the bravest and most cunning fisherman can come out on top. Use the environment to your advantage, master the unconventional oar-based movement system and outsmart your opponents. Dominate the northern seas and bring honor to your nation in Unknown Fisherman Battlegrounds.</p>\n<p>In essence, Unknown Fisherman Battleground is a 2-4 player battler, where the players row a boat with unlinked leftward and rightward force which, when applied together, force the boat forward - Other than this, the players have a harpoon launcher which rotates freely from the boat itself, with which they can launch swordfish at their opponents with the intention of sinking them. The last player whose ship has not sunk at the end of the battle wins.</p>\n<p>Game Design:<br/>Patrick H\u00e4lleby<br/>Sebastian Routh<br/>Johnny Chang<br/>Erik Wahlstr\u00f6m<br/><br/>3D Art:<br/>Jim Naraha<br/>Victoria Reinhold<br/>Sigge Sandstr\u00f6m</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4da74bdc9fa95fcec2df4399b2d3ec86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PatrickHalleby"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
