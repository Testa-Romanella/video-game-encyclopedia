It was built over 8 weeks from idea to game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game takes a 'tetris-like' approach to puzzle-solving. You connect correct pieces together to create blocks, and further combine blocks to build up the puzzle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would like to add other levels to this game in the near future, so I can build a narrative element into the game. The most challenging element of the process was working out the code so that the game has a 'tetris' element, now this has been done I can use this code to build more intricate and non-rectangle/square objects.<br/><br/>INTENDING TO UPLOAD NEW VERSION OF GAME 31st MARCH.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T11:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da2/da2074a31839d0b23516085c563b3ba7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["arabellaturner"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
