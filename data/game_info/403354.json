You are faster than green and can teleport, but the blues will chase you. Being eventually caught is inevitable.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;Blue&gt;</strong><br/>There are two blue characters who will chase the red. One builds up speed over time and the other drifts. The key to avoiding them is moving in circles and teleporting away when they get too close. Once they catch red the game ends and green becomes the victor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T03:16:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24d/24d46cc3a14088a56025954086a0df43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vespies"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
