Did not expect to complete it but here we are! I've attempted to combine sports and card game genres for a fun(I hope!) experience. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>How to Play-<br/>Drag cards from the bottom of the screen to the top to play a card. Decrease your opponent's stamina to 0 before yours reaches 0 to win. OR have more stamina than your opponent at the end of 12 rounds.</p>\n<p>Strength is the amount of damage you deal.<br/>Dexterity is the chance to counter(deal 1.5x damage!)<br/>Fortitude is how much damage is reduced before hitting your stamina.</p>\n<p>After three turns, the round ends and you get a choice of three options. Choose wisely, thank you for playing and best of luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T04:45:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbb4733017bc613cb5aab1c3ce1f33c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AutumnAdelaide"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
