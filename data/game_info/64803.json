Move the paddle to deflect the ball against a range of shifting obstacles. As with the original game, your goal is to anticipate the path of the ball and control its movement. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut VIARKANOID takes the format to the next level by taking all the elements that made Arkanoid such a classic and re-inventing them for the virtual age. Test your reflexes in interactive game rooms inspired by the worlds of architecture, film and art, featuring mind-bending walls and rotating bricks. Boasting absorbing gameplay and multiple abstract levels, VIARKANOID puts you in the heart of the action for a truly dynamic gaming experience!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d7/7d7806ec9d81777d077e458a92292c70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VIAR.STUDIO"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VIAR.STUDIO"], "esrb_rating": null}
