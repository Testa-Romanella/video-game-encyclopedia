Everyone has abandoned the city. Now it's far too cold for you to get to safety. With the last of your strength, you push forward. But once you've stopped, you won't be able to keep going.</p>\n<p>In this platformer, you can move left, right and dash, but the moment you stop doing it, can't start again. (E.g\u00a0: If you start moving left, the moment you lift your finger off the left key, you can't use that input again).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This combines elements of platforming with puzzle games. In order to reach the end of a level, you'll need to plan out every move in advance.</p>\n<p>EDIT : Added some descriptions and the web version of the game (Please update properly this time)</p>\n<p>CREDITS (apart from me)</p>\n<p>Jump SFX by cabled_mess :\u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/cabled_mess/sounds/350898/<br/>Win and death SFX by LittleRobotSoundFactory\u00a0:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:04:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44b/44b4b9d4c48dc7c7ef9e473bf8674d1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Scadimal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
