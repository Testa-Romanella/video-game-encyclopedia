This is very easy to do in the event schedule. However, if the developer uses this functionality several times in his project, he will inevitably have to create a common event to streamline this routine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Description:\u00a0</strong>This script is not intended to revolutionize game development. But it can streamline the routine of developers who need to memorize the position of the map and teleport the player to that position.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plugin commands:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Save Position:\u00a0</strong>Saves the player's current position.</p>\n<p><strong>Save Map / Position:</strong> Saves the position of a specified map.</p>\n<p><strong>Teleport to Map:\u00a0</strong>Teleports the player to the previously saved map.</p>\n<p><strong>Tel. To reverse the map D:\u00a0</strong>Teleports the player to a previously saved map. The difference is that the player's direction after teleportation will be the opposite direction that was saved.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>It is possible to configure a variable to store the ID of the last saved map!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:09:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/350/350e62b9495703a6f10ecf5759d66bf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TecnoAnalogica"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
