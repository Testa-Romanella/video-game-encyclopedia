You'll have to avoid falling off of the edge while maneuvering around tight areas. Do you think you can make it through all the levels before your score reaches zero? If you run into a wall and get stuck,\r\nyou won't lose when the timer runs out, so you can still finish all of the levels.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAO features 30 challenging puzzles for 1 or 2 players. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87a/87a9216c3de1e86e83352eb2620a3891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Second Dimension R&T"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
