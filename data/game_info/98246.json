You might get caught if you try to take an item early... or you might be quick enough not to. Your love interest might be what you expected... or you may have to ask yourself questions these games tend to leave unasked.</p><p>\r\n\tFeatures include six different \r\n\t<strong>endings</strong>, four different <strong>achievements</strong>, a fair amount of original <strong>artwork</strong> (featured mainly in the endings) and a rather nifty <strong>soundtrack</strong>.</p><p>\n<em>My Website</em>: Gaming Pixie's Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/090/090cc18b2829fea51c7669c72a2e70af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rochelle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
