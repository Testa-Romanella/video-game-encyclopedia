The perspective and art style are a homage to Crimsonland and other top-down shooters of that era, and the simple control scheme that lets you play with only one finger is a nod to Canabalt and Leap Day.</p>\n<p>Jack, the game\u2019s protagonist leaves the bar at night and tries to go home, but quickly realises that he\u2019s in no condition to do so \u2013 he\u2019s so drunk that he cannot stop spinning in circles. What\u2019s worse \u2013 he starts seeing Goblins (or are they really there?) that don\u2019t really like him that much and start attacking him. Luckily, Jack has his trusty shotgun that he can use to defend himself and move around the arena using recoil since he cannot walk.</p>\n<p>The goal is simple: defeat 99 goblins and face the boss, the Legendary Blue Goblin to unlock an ancient weapon that provides you with an ultimate challenge of your skills.</p>\n<p>Tap the screen once to shoot. Hold the screen to engage bullet-time and release the screen to shoot while in it.</p>\n<p>Project Post-mortem</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T05:52:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f8b5b1987f3daf588a23bb0464fe720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DataGreed"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
