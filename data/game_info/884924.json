He was nice enough to send you a letter with instructions on how to make your Christmas special! <br/></p>\n<p>This game is a short little point n' click adventure (similar to Myst, but not as cool). Move around the world by clicking on points of interests with the mouse. Some machines (like arcade cabinets / computers) can be interacted with by using the arrow keys and the spacebar. The ESCAPE-button will quit the game, so be careful! \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T05:58:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7b/e7b068f37f5343e58bd148ee2f4cad97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunshine_Error"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
