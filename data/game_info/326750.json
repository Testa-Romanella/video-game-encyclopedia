Or did she?</p>\n<p>You soon learn that things aren't, quite, what they seem in this short interactive meta-fictional CYOA game.\u00a0Your Prince Has Drowned\u00a0started life as a short story inspired by old school text adventures.\u00a0Now it's been re-invented as a Twine game! Well, a Twine <em>story</em> where your choices can have serious consequences, really.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Play for <em>free </em>in your desktop browser! Or support me by buying a downloadable version.</li><li>Buying a copy also gives you access to the Hints Booklet.</li><li>No save points and virtually no permadeath.</li><li>A somewhat snarky interface. Be kind to it.</li><li>Choices! (I mean, it's interactive fiction, of course there are choices.)</li><li>Metatextuality.</li><li>Almost 9,500 words of text!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Content notes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Some decisions lead to major character death.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Other Notes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The Hints Booklet contains notes on how to avoid the few permanent death situations\u00a0and a complete walkthrough to get to the ending fastest.</li><li>Because of the way HTML5/Twine games get processed on itch.io, running it through the website\u00a0is sadly\u00a0<em>not</em> mobile-friendly at the moment. One day I'll figure out how to get that working properly! The HTML file you can download, however, should work fine on all screens.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T04:29:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ba/5ba04b528d14d7456a8601dbfeb95174.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lynn E.
