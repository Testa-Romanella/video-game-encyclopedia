(Hermeticum)", "description": "<p>If you want to learn how to fly you are at the right place \u2013 you can do so after completing several levels of this exciting game. :)</p>\n<p>This is a simple simulator of airplane flight control. Added to this are some elements of the game, as a result of which you need to score as many points as possible and get a \"pilot certificate\" in the end. At first, it is better to carefully familiarize yourself with the control keys - at first glance there are many of them, but in fact there are only six main ones: the traditional <strong>W, S, E, D</strong> and arrows \u2013 right and left. Arrows of course turn both on the ground and in the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Starting from the 2nd level a ghost plane will appear in the air which, when comes in direct contact with yout cockpit will take away 2 points. But you can shoot it down (usin the <strong>0</strong> key - not the letter O), and receive +1 point for each hit. After 10 hits the ghost place will fly away but in the next level it will appear again.\u00a0\r\nIf the final result is more than 1000 points, you can enter your name in the \"Flight Certificate\" and it will be placed together with your result in the form of an image in the <strong>Diplom</strong> folder.<br/></p>\n<p>Read the full instructions for the game from accessing the Menu once you lauch the game.</p>\n<p>And please let us know what you think about this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T08:26:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/122/1223d6a43691d5ea7f9264de285c6f51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hermeticum"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
