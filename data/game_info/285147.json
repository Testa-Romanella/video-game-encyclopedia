How is this different from all the other FPS games?</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Very small maps (arenas). </strong> Imagine this: Throw two teams of heavily armed fighters into a tiny, cramped  room.\u00a0 Then lock the door and throw away the keys.\u00a0 <em>You will be forced to fight. Constantly.\u00a0 </em>There are no places to hide or take a break. The only way out is to unplug the game and return to your boring life. <em>Now you're not a quitter, are you?</em></li><li><strong>Spawn near your enemies, face-to-face - Always.  </strong>This ensures you jump right into the action. You'll never have to travel for miles around a map to find your enemies - they'll always be right in front of you \u00a0 Don't you hate typical FPS games that have you running around for the first 10 minutes with no action and when you finally spot an enemy, you get killed and returned to the start location for rinse/repeat? In this game, you'll never have that! The shootout begins as soon as you land!</li><li><strong>Instant respawn.</strong> Players that are killed are re-spawned instantly.\u00a0 It's a win/win: You return right back to the action with ammo restored and no down time. And your enemies get to beat you down quickly again and again and again, like an endless wave of cannon fodder.</li><li><strong>Tons of Ammo:</strong> Each weapon features a little bit more ammo than\u00a0is typical of FPS deathmatch games.  Less reloading. More fighting.</li><li><strong>Limited ammo clips. </strong>Just because you have more ammo does not mean you should have unlimited ammo! We prevent the camping of enemy spawn points by limiting your ammo so that eventually you WILL be depleted, and there will be no way to restore ammo without respawning... unless you play the SLICER class with the brutal Katana weapon.</li><li><strong>Close-range weaponry:</strong> All weapons were designed for fun close-range engagements. </li></ul>\n<br/>NO PAY-TO-WIN\r\n<p>Pay once and done! This is not a free-to-play game. No In-app-purchases... ever. No pay-to-win... ever.<br/></p>\n<p>yptic War. Their destruction is of the highest priority for The Enforcers.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nSPECIAL EARLY PRICING!\r\n<p>Early-release alpha pricing is in effect!! Future updates are under development. We want to see how the early release does first.\u00a0\u00a0 The future price may increase as updates are released - updates that will be free for existing customers.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nLOADOUT TYPES\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED\r\n<p>You can play either multiplayer or singleplayer with bots.

As we gain players, we will be adding permanent accounts - this allows you to login and save your scores and stats, create friendlists, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE MAPS: </strong>We're planning a slew of fun, short-range maps, while making enhancements to the current offerings.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>MORE WEAPONS: </strong>We will be adding a wider variety of weapons, unique to their player classes. \u00a0For example, we may add several variants of the brutal Energy Katana weapon to the Slicer class, which will not be available to the other classes.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE CLASSES:</strong> We plan to add 1 to 2 more player classes, but this is lower priority for now.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CLASS &amp; LOADOUT CUSTOMIZATION: </strong>Give you the option to customize the loadout for each player class. This update ties into the \"MORE WEAPONS\" update that will allow you to select different weapon combos.</p>\n<p><strong>OFFLINE PLAY: </strong>Currently, singleplayer bots mode still requires you to be connected to the internet. This is because we encourage you to host bot games that are also open to human players - it's more fun that way. \u00a0  We are exploring fun offline modes and may add some few mission-based gameplay - depending on demand.</p>\n<p><strong>GRAPHICS ENHANCEMENT</strong>: As the game evolves, we will upgrade the graphics where needed.\u00a0 A balance must be made with this because we still would like to be able to target players with lower to mid-end hardware.\u00a0 Remember:\u00a0 In a multiplayer game, more players equals to more people available to play with you!\u00a0 So we want to keep hardware requirements minimal and lower the barrier to entry.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Happy playing!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T03:50:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f29ab3d27c25720e0a67e94983ff282.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 507, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Infinity62"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
