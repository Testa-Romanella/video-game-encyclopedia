Don't ask me. Anyway, make your way though the 5 \"quality\" levels. It's a quick one, folks. Modeled after \"I Wanna Be The Boshy\"'s physics.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>Use WASD to move. You can hit \"Enter\"\u00a0and \"Escape\" in level transitions to make it faster, but you can also just click the buttons on the screen.<br/><br/>The Ram is modeled after Sorbet Jungle's Sol Ram, which is amazingly cute. Go buy it.<br/>There's an inappropriate voice line, provided by Tourettes Guy (I don't own the clip). If you need me to remove it, just message me.<br/><br/>(It's my first game, made in a couple of days. Be gentle ;))<br/><br/>There's a couple of glitches, but they're all hilarious and can actually save time in levels. Good luck finding them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ad/1ad85e2927944cf9dbb629ff30f0677d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JavaKouhai"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
