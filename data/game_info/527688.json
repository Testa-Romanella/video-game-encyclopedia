You have two tools at your disposal: a metal detector and a shovel. Use the detector to locate the presents then dig down to grab them. The game ends when you've found all six.</p>\n<p>The detector beeps faster when you're closer to a present, and at a higher pitch for more <strong><em>valuable </em></strong>presents.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\r\nWASDMoveMouseLookMouse WheelSwitch tool (Metal detector or Shovel)Mouse Click\u00a0(with shovel selected)DigEPick up presentEscQuit\r\n\n<p><strong>Game Jam Modifiers:</strong></p>\n<p>Xephos and Honeydew (Make a game that involves digging!
