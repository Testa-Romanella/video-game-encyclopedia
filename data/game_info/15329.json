Any attempt at fighting back has failed. \u00a0We lost contact with the fleet, they are assumed to be destroyed. Now the battle has come to Earth. Our resources have dwindled; our defenses are destroyed. Staging an assault is impossible. Our only chance for survival is you, Earth\u2019s last pilot.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Survival:</strong> \u00a0<br/>You are the last pilot in the last ship standing between Earth and invading alien army. Your job is to destroy the approaching waves of enemies so escape pods can leave Earth\u2019s orbit. You will have to withstand not only the enemy drones, fighters and blockade runners but also offensive satellites and the massive almost indestructible mothership.<br/><br/><strong>Defend:</strong> <br/>The last orbiting defensive satellite has been damaged. Earth has sent a bot to fix it, but it\u2019s up to you to keep the enemy away until its repaired. This time you\u2019re not alone, you\u2019ve got gun turrets to help keep the satellite safe. If the satellite is lost, it\u2019s game over, for you and for Earth.<br/><br/><strong>Minefield:</strong> <br/>The enemy has found a way to disable your primary weapons leaving you with only bombs, mines and flares to destroy the enemy. How long can you last?<br/><br/><strong>Classic:</strong> <br/>Defend against waves of increasingly fast enemies heading straight towards the Earth.
