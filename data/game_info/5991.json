Can you imagine anything more awesome than dodging a rain of enemy bullets to a mighty Dubstep beat, turning the alien enemies into atoms, while dancing happily to this?<br />\nWhat? Punching the bad guy&#39;s face in close combat? No problem!<br />\nWow, slow down! You wanna fight already?<br />\nWait. You didn&#39;t think that we will let you go with this metallic lemon?<br />\nYou have 10 unique spaceships at your service, with each an individual ability.<br />\nFor some to unlock, you have to sweat pretty much - but it&#39;s totally worth it!<br />\nBesides this, if you&#39;re attached to your old ship already, you can upgrade it to turn it into a real machine of vengeance.<br />\nSo far, we have:<br />\n- A deep written love-story, which will make you cry<br />\n- Pixelart style. You don&#39;t see this around often!<br />\n- Unbelievable musical levels<br />\n- 4 difficulty modes<br />\n- Great bosses<br />\n- Awesome music from awesome musicians<br />\n- A dancing guy in the corner. Wow!<br />\nSeriously?<br />\nYou have read until the end and haven&#39;t started playing yet? So what if I tell you there are explosions? Lot&#39;s of explosions!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T11:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ab/1ab7a0c8184bcdf804d20061d29afbf3.jpeg", "website": "http://www.beat-da-beat.com", "rating": 3.57, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 38, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Caliburnus", "2 players"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nekki", "Caliburnus"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
