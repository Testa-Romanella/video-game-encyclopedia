Always having to rip people apart? Not anymore yo, play as Oliver, a simple werewolf by night, who by morning probably has a part-time job to go to. He's just doing his thing. </p><p>W, A, S, D to move around, use space to jump (and skip the intro cutscene). Hold the right mouse button down to move the camera, use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Near certain buildings hold space to allow Oliver to automatically scale the building, some buildings are easier to climb than others - but Oliver will not climb the buildings that have been so nice as to allow him access into them. Did you know there are some buildings you can enter?</p><p>Music: Jack Milgate</p><p>Unity Store Assets:</p><p> - Clock, Vis Games</p><p> - Nature Starter Kit 2</p><p> - Sky5X One, RKD</p><p> - BG Curve, Banshee Gz</p><p>Everything else is T-Dog eXtreme!
