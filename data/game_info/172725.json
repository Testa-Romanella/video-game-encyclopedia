That will come in a later version. \u00a0</p>\n<p>For now, a Halloween-themed teaser, for my favorite time of year. :-) \u00a0Walk around with blue balls in the strip club and smash pumpkins before the time is up! \u00a0See how many you can get and how fast. \u00a0Laugh at my cheesy art, and appreciate the song ironically also named \u201cBlue Balls\u201d which I found here on NG. Check out the musician &amp; give him some support here \u25ba https://chead86.newgrounds.com</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been here on Newgrounds for quite a while now, but this is my 1st self-made 3d WebGL game I\u2019m happy to share with you! \u00a0My partner has been giving me Unity lessons but my favorite aspect of game-making has been making 3d art, so that\u2019s been my main focus. \u00a0The only model I didn\u2019t make here is the destructible pumpkin.</p>\n<p>Hope you will be kind enough to rate &amp; leave constructive feedback, but keep in mind I\u2019m still quite a noob at game dev. \u00a0I\u2019m a sensitive flower, so hope u take it easy but let me know how I can improve my skills :-D </p>\n<p>Stay in touch if you\u2019re curious about future projects, collabs etc!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.</p>\n<p>- Jenni </p>\n<p>Blue Balls song: https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/23727</p>\n<p>My C# teacher: http://MartianGames.newgrounds.com</p>\n<p>\u201cBlue Balls\u201d on GameJolt too :-D https://gamejolt.com/games/BlueBalls/292942 </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9f1cdc85376bcc4203315b0e8016fb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JenniNexus"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
