A tribute to the best Mario Party 2 minigame of all time.</p>\n<p>This game draws heavy emphasis from Mario Party 2's slot car derby minigame except things have been slightly changed to make gameplay a bit more interesting. Instead of restricting the ability to change slots the car drives in you can freelly switch lanes. Powerups will randomly spawn on the lanes for use. This game is still receiving updates and new features every now and then when I have time to make them.</p>\n\n<p>This game has a playable web version for your browser or also a better looking PC standalone version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/145dce7cde1cefb9e04295c97869319e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Scylez"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
