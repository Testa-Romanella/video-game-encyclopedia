For people unacquainted with \r\nOctopus City simulation genre, the simulation resembles adventure \r\ngames of yore, immersing players in a fascinating setting filled with \r\nunusual characters. We place special emphasis on exploration, replay \r\nvalue and the consequences of choices.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAssume the role of Kaf \r\nKafkaryan, a cowardly middle-aged octopus blood junkie and tentacle \r\ntrimmer, living in a city built around a giant octopus. Kaf has succumbed to bizarre nightmares about a world populated by twisted creatures. To aid the inhabitants of his dreams, he must explore the underside of the towering metropolis and learn more about the seedy lives of its citizens. Along the way he becomes entangled in a conspiracy with far-reaching implications for Octopus City.</p>\n<p>The simulation is scheduled for release in the future. It was originally funded by a Kickstarter Campaign. This is a demo comprising one of the early chapters. If you like our work please support us by pre-ordering the simulation and become an official OctoFan\u2122.</p>\n<p>We're really excited about this release and we hope you enjoy it. We encourage you to play more than once, because a lot of the content you'll see depends on your choices and approach. There are multiple endings, and some variations on each of them, in addition to various ways to complete the main quest. Talk to NPCs, learn gossip, and be careful about the choices you make. More importantly, have fun and remember to say no to Octoblood!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c2/3c2c343a84a98f6740c1d91bc80dd59f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ghost in a Bottle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
