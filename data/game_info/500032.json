A <strong>10</strong> months in the making!\u00a0Help Connor reach the end of the 8 cleverly-named, challenging, yet fair mazes while avoiding all sorts of Sipals, Tornados, and those always prevalent spikes. Use keys to unlock obstructed paths, or use Speedboosts to your advantage. Choose from three different game modes: Casual, where you try to make it through all 8 levels with the least number of deaths, Arcade, where you only have 100 lives, or One Life, where you only have one life. Complete the game in this mode and be awarded accordingly...<br/>Unlock different types of Connors by searching\u00a0 the mazes for elusive blue exits, sometimes needing to be accessed with an invisible key that only shines to show where it is.
