Shoot enemies and collect shards to increase hxp, increasing your gun's health and experience points. The higher your hxp, the more powerful your gun (pistol has multiple shot patterns, machine gun fires faster, charge gun charges faster). Get hit by bullets and your gun's hxp decreases. If your gun's hxp reaches 0, it will explode after 3 seconds, killing you if you don't throw it away. If you get hit by a bullet when Unarmed, it will kill you</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Mouse to aim</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button to Shoot</p>\n<p>Right mouse button to Pickup/Throw guns</p>\n<p>1/2 or Scroll wheel to swap weapons<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T11:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/797/7973a286c58ffc29290dfa6ac5bf3f21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BoneDaddy64"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
