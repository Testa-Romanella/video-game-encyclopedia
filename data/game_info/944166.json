You are tasked with killing Dracula, but there's one problem:\u00a0Dracula's castle is pitch black inside!\u00a0Vampires (and their minions) have great night vision so that's no problem for them, but you'll need to use all your other senses to find and kill Dracula.\u00a0 Dracula is distracted, feeding on disciples, so now is your chance. Use your senses to guide you through the castle and when you know where Dracula is, fire the silver arrow to kill that blood-sucking jerk\u00a0for definitely the last time.</p>\n<p><strong>Use the arrow keys to move, space bar to fire.\u00a0</strong>(alternately use WSAD and Enter)</p>\n<p><strong>When you fire, it will ask which direction to fire in. Press an arrow key to fire in that direction.</strong></p>\n<p>Use the clues your senses give you to figure out where obstacles are. When you hear, smell, or feel something, there's a hazard\u00a0in one of the rooms you can move to from here. Avoid the hazards, and, when you know where Dracula is, fire your arrow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T08:13:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/841/841c926f2907565a2b3f150b78eefdf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["gardrek"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
