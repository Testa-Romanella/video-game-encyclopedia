We designed this game to understand and explain what it is like to look at life through the eyes of a taxi driver.<br/>You can grapple with all sorts of ordeals on a deserted mountain road and make your bread with your sweat, or you can manage a taxi station in the city and swim in money.<br/><br/>Taxi Simulator is being prepared by a young developer.
