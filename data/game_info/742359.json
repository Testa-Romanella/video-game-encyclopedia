Some go to Heaven, some go to Hell and some are sent back to Earth to have another go at it.</p>\n<p>Direction:</p>\n<p>This game is a mouse driven, drag and drop sorting game. Download the zip, unpack and doubleclick the 8B2I_Time2.exe file to play. Windows Only.</p>\n<p>Souls come down the stream as orbs. Blue Orbs go to Heaven (Blue Stream), Red Orbs go to hell (Lava Stream) and Purple Orbs go to Reincarnation (Purple Stream). Use your mouse to capture the fast moving souls and drag them to their fate.</p>\n<p>You can play it straight and properly sort souls OR cause celestial mayhem by improperly sorting souls.
