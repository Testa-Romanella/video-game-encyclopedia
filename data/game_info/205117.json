{"id": 205117, "slug": "root-game", "name": "Root Game", "name_original": "Root Game", "description": "<p>Root Game is inspired by the root chakra or\u00a0Muladhara,\u00a0which is located at the base of the spine of our bodies. It's\u00a0color is red, and it is associated with survival, the feeling of safety,\u00a0basic human\u00a0needs and\u00a0physical identity, building a foundation for living our lives.\u00a0The chakras can get\u00a0out of balance, and this might cause functional problems in our bodies. With this mini-game, I wanted to represent the act of re-balancing the root chakra.</p>\n<p>A chakra\u00a0is\u00a0a vortex of spinning energy, so I decomposed the parts of the symbol or Muladhara and made each part spin towards\u00a0different directions at\u00a0various speed. There is a spinning triangle right at the centre, and the player can shoot energy beams through the tips of the 3 corners of the triangle. The player aims\u00a0to push away the little triangles spinning around the large circle by shooting at them.\u00a0 The player must protect the little circles (eggs) and not shoot them, in order to win the game. There are 4 eggs, and if the player pops all of them by mistake, the game is over. The objective is dropping all the triangles without damaging the eggs.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9ba0e8f1ac2489f477e4911e9463e01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Su K\u0131z\u0131la\u011fa\u00e7"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
