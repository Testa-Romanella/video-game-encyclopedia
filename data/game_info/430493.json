Due to his timid personality and poor social skills, he chooses to stay home and absorb himself in studying on his free time. However, on a hot day during the summer break, he had a fateful run-in with Chieri, a fellow student from his university. Chieri, who goes by Chii-chan among her friends, is an outgoing social butterfly and the center of attention wherever she goes, but studying turns out to be not one of her strong suits. Having just failed her exams and facing the threat of expulsion, Chii-chan immediately seized the opportunity and enlisted Kouta as her tutor. Now forced into spending time with a woman clearly out of his league, Kouta's summer just became a lot more interesting.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Features</h3></strong><ul><ul><li>A Slice of Life Visual Novel Experience!</li></ul><ul><li>An Immersive Japanese Setting</li></ul><ul><li>Fully Voiced Heroine</li></ul><ul><li>Amazing Artwork</li></ul><ul><li>And Immersive Story!</li></ul></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T05:23:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/364/36402dc8fef9c18852ad1c61dcb2c91e.jpg", "website": "http://www.kaguragames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orcsoft"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Kagura Games", "FAKKU"], "esrb_rating": null}
