Hangul is the third in a set of learning tools that I developed to test how far your language learning has taken you. This version is for the Korean syllabary 'Hangul'.<br/><br/>This program is designed to let you know how well your language studies have paid off. If you can manage a high score, you can be confident that you are ready to move on to learning consonant clusters. I made these games because I can never tell when it is okay to say \"I know this language!\"</p><p>If you're the type who learns by trial and error, you can use this to teach yourself a few things! Hangul is a writing system that is extremely easy to learn, so with 10 minutes of study on YouTube\u2013 you can easily rack up combos of 40 or 50 in this game. Try it!</p><p>This game was funded as a stretch goal for \"Let's Go! Katakana\" on Kickstarter. Thank you all again!<br/><br/>If you stream it, be sure to let me know on Twitter! I'll pop in and say hey!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93d/93d26dcae8a021b7dd8307495432432e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Motoko"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
