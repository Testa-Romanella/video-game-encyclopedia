Thousands of years have passed and humanity has destroyed everything in their path. At this point in time, humanity no more but the spirit remains.\r\n<br/>One day it discovers a little seed and takes control over it. With this seed the player embarks on a beautiful journey to plant trees and bring back nature into the world.\r\n<p>The gameplay itself is a \u201cAngry Birds\u201d style sidescroller where the player can swipe + release to shoot the seed in any direction. By collecting water droplets, the seed will soak up. Eventually, with enough water collected, a new tree will grow and produce a new seed.</p><p>The goal is to grow as many trees as possible (my personal record is 5)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T22:21:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/585/58504bc743161c14808dc87c558cbedd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["bitbrain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
