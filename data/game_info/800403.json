Big time.</p>\n<p>Pursuing the arts, you visit\u00a0a local art gallery for inspiration and peace. When a stranger interrupts your quiet, you witness a woman's swift demise after going mad, believing she was being watched by a painting.</p>\n<p>Taken by the stranger to a space of unlimited corridors, you meet two other individuals with their own passion for the arts, who all seem worried about you carrying a strange side effect of the eldritch: eyes sprawling over your body, melting into your skin.</p>\n<p>But whether or not you have the illness is truly none of their concern, for they need to stick their claws into your flesh to create something new. Will you find some way to escape your fate by infection or by their hands? Or will you die and die again?</p><p><strong>This demo is the beginning of the game, where you meet the three main characters and get a feel for their personalities before choosing their routes. That is why the to be continued ending is the same for everyone!\u00a0It'd therefore branch into their routes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Current demo features:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>12k+ words</li><li>Four endings (one death for each character, and 1 continue for everyone)</li><li>A gender neutral MC [choose your own name!}</li><li>A ton of CGs and fun panels!\u00a0How do I count?
