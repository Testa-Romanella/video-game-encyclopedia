These fortunes are just for fun though, don't go make this awkward by being too intense now.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Place cards lowest first into Discard Pile. Cards placed on top of each other can only be of higher value or a wild card. Use a wild card to clear Discard Pile. If you cannot place a card, remove the Discard Pile and have 1 strike go against you. If you hit three strikes, you lose. If you discard all three Deck Piles, you win!<br/><br/>Card values are started with the smallest, Ace to 10, Page, Knight, Queen, King. The Major Arcana is wild and will clear any cards in the Discard Pile.<br/><br/>Clear at least 3 Major Arcana cards to receive a fortune.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16d/16da4238762a4b21827ec3a077b832c1_PdJzeUs.jpg", "website": "http://intropygames.com/solitarot", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Intropy Games L.
