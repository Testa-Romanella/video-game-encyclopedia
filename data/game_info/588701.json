In a sense\r\nI wrote this through the perspective of someone who is constantly chasing a partner who left them. When grief, and perhaps bitterness, of them moving on consumes you. Instead of accepting new partners for who they are, you are constantly chasing the person who left. Looking for traces of them in others, versus finding healing for yourself.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:27:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b9e32588944570e9e4659db88de5694.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["queerlich"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
