Langrisser II was also remade on the Super Famicom by Masaya as Der Langrisser, which featured multiple paths through the game, greatly reduced difficulty, and reworked graphics. A PC-FX port, Der Langrisser FX, was also released, featuring animated cut-scenes. It was later compiled with the first Langrisser for the PlayStation as Langrisser I&amp;II, and then given a script edit and new branch of the Imperial path in its final Saturn remake as Langrisser: Dramatic Edition. A Windows 98 release of the game was released in Japanese, Chinese and Korean; it features redrawn, high-resolution graphics, but a vastly trimmed-down soundtrack to fit the confines of a standard length CD.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bf/6bff74c5dc0641abdbf3fa105130b770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Wii", "PC", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Career Soft", "Masaya Games", "Team Career"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Masaya", "Nippon Computer Systems"], "esrb_rating": null}
