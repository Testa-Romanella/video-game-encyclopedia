Snow covers the ground like a blanket,\u00a0and the trees stand naked in the wind. When you are stuck outside after dark, and the cold is biting your hands, it is not.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the romantic campsite you found seems to be on an ancient burial ground. Why else are there so many ghosts determined to put out your fire? If they succeed in killing your fire, you have nothing to start it again, and you will be one more victim of the cruel cold.</p>\n<p>Feed your fire, ward off the ghosts, and whatever you do, make sure to keep warm!</p>\n\n<p>***************\u00a0Freeze or Burn ***************</p>\n<p>Game Objective: Survive the night</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0WASD to move, space to pick-up/place wood, left-mouse to shoot</p>\n\n<p><em>(Created for a 48-hour game jam)</em><br/></p>\n<p>Programming :: Jon Fisher</p>\n<p>Art :: Sophia Fisher</p>\n<p>Testing :: Adrian Fisher</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T09:37:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91e/91e9843f8a494caaa0454f6232bd688b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["funemaker", "Sophia/cats"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
