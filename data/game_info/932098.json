This little blue bird is back in action in this Nokia adaptation of Blu the Airmail Delivery Bird.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to deliver mail, while dodging enemies and walls, and to score as high as you can before you run out of lives.<br/></p>\n<p>Sorry this game isn't as polished as I'd like, but there's an ice storm warning for our state and I wanted to get something out before we potentially lost power.<br/></p>\n<p>Press and hold Z to shoot mail. Press X to fire shots. Press UP/DOWN to move. Press SPACE to pause. Alternatively you can use the numpad (see in-game for mapping.) Finally, you can press F1 to enable an LCD ghosting simulation, if that's your thing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T14:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcb/bcb6fcb259eaa9cb16f486e5ce1bc236.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tailfeather Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
