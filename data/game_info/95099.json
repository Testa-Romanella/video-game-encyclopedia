But hey, you can win or lose, and that's what makes a game, right?</p>\n<p>Don't forget to check Help and Options for the controls! The game supports both KB+M and controller.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fe/9fe9c4937be193cc5c5d2f605da1b3c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["aFoolsDuty"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
