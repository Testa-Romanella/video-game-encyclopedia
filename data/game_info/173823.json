On the surface, it's gravity bending platformer where players assume the role of a square.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Underneath, Mediocre is   about   the   experiences   of   life.\r\nIt's\u00a0 all   about   highs   and   lows.   Life takes   you   through   ups   and   downs   and   even   flips   you   around.\r\nAt   times,   it   feels   like   your   failures   end   with   you   going   in   circles.\r\nHowever,   you'll   find   that   when   you   don't   succeed   at   first,   you   always   get   a   second   chance.\r\nAfter   all,   going   through   life   is   a   process   of   trial   and   error. When things get mediocre, never   give   up.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b37cd5b876d56a33be7efdece42bcd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gameheads", "mournsky"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
