You will see four bars which are rest, hunger, thirst, and health. When the rest, thirst, or hunger become 0, then it will decrease the health.

However, there are a lot of things that can cause Panda's death: lack of rest, starvation, thirst, predators, etc.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T15:57:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de2/de246a084fd8eccd42ab86c437b52a81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["StevenZhang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
