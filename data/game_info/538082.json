For the 32BitHoliday jam, I decided to make more content for PyraMaze.\u00a0The old levels from the previous jam entry are included in this build. Once you finish everything in the snowy areas, you will have access to the jungle level via Warp.<br/><br/>This game is a WIP.\u00a0\u00a0 I am\u00a0 working on more story and gameplay.\u00a0\u00a0 This game throws you into the middle of the story without much explanation.\u00a0 I am\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0working on that too =D<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Please follow\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@AsFunAsFun\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0for any updates on PyraMaze.<br/><br/><br/>(HINT - You don't need to climb the stairs.
