The whole gameplay takes place on the main hero\u2019s computer desktop. You hack servers, take money from the banks, upgrade your hardware and software.<br />\nIn contrast to the previous Hacker Evolution games, Duality is a much more accessible entry, even though it is still a niche game with a steep learning curve. Servers in the game have two primary stats: firewall and integrity. Lowering first one lets you access files or take the money from it. If the server\u2019s integrity drops, it gets destroyed. To do so, you can use several hackers \u201cweapons,\u201d such as a DOS attack or EMP attack. Besides the usual servers, there are some AI controlled, that can attack you back. <br />\nThe game is very fast-paced. Every minute of the game costs you some amount of money. Such mechanic makes time-management and quick decision-making an integral part of improving in the game. <br />\nHacker Evolution Duality also offers a multiplayer with different modes where compete against both other players and hostile AI servers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-11T08:44:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb85f1e95c52b28bc9dfcc09eac9a310.jpg", "website": "http://www.HackerEvolutionDuality.com", "rating": 2.23, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 41, "owned": 1110, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 19}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 39, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 39, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["exosyphen studios"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["exosyphen studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
