{"id": 923486, "slug": "daves-tale", "name": "Dave's Tale", "name_original": "Dave's Tale", "description": "<p>Dave\u2019s Tale is a text-based adventure game and narrates the life of Dave at his job where all the employees have gone missing. The game includes a range of paths the player can take of which go to a different outcome. Dave is followed by the Narrator who tells Dave where to go and judges him on his actions. I wanted this experience to have mystery, interaction, and be funny, and to really immerse the player into the story. I did these things by providing a reason for the player to explore, this is to find the missing employees and the irregular job Dave has. Next the interaction, the player can choose from different outcomes and find new paths if played differently; if the player waits long enough at some screens, they will be presented with a new path. Since Dave does not talk I wanted the Narrator to entertain and light up the space as he guides Dave, though Dave does not always listen. The Narrator will attempt to guide the player but will become annoyed and surprised when the player does irregular things. And to wrap up the package this is to be immersive for the player by getting interested in the story and all making their own path full of funny and irregular decisions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T07:47:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2aaf0fe74c5b2fc5323050d8d20d85e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bfigueroa"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
