{"id": 942122, "slug": "glitch-garden-redminidragon", "name": "Glitch Garden (RedMiniDragon)", "name_original": "Glitch Garden (RedMiniDragon)", "description": "<p>It's been a while since I've last uploaded something here...</p>\n<p>As you might (or might not) guessed, <strong>Glitch Garden</strong> is a game made from following tutorials for making Unity games on Udemy. Here's the link incase people want to follow it (though, it's from the archived version).</p>\n<p><strong>Small backstory</strong>: I wanted to make a cool game (like many who first downloaded Unity) and discarded it because it was too confusing. I got YouTube ads talking about Udemy, gave it a try, and stopped halfway my first game because I wanted to make a BIG text adventure. I picked it up to try again and finally made A young Dragon's (Text) Adventure. I watched Zero Punctuation, and he did a challenge to make 1 game per month. I wanted to do the same...and it wasn't the smartest move. I burned out. It only worked when each game lesson was small, and Glitch Garden wasn't small.</p>\n<p>While I try to follow each lesson to learn what to do, I try to put my own spin on each game I make. I use only assets I make (I'm no musician, so no music). I only use characters I made or own. The only games made outside of the tutorials are dress up games and the UFO game.</p>\n<p>I based the game off of glitches because it's called <em>Glitch Garden</em>, it has to be based on glitches. I based the glitches (or at least one of them), on MissingNo. from Pok\u00e9mon. The Vaccines are system patches, so they are patchwork-y. The color scheme and game appearance are actually inspired by an old game site I went on to learn about cool glitches called TRsRockin.com. The site was simple, but it talked about MissingNo. and various glitches in Pok\u00e9mon, as well as glitches in Mario, and it was what made me play Pok\u00e9mon Blue (emulated). The color scheme (black with a blue side bar) always makes me think of cool glitches in retro games. I wanted to carry over the colors and that feeling over to this game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T13:33:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5be/5be70767aa922d8bc491ad1b28c365ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RedMiniDragon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
