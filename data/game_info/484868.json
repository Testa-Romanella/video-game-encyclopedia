You have been enlisted to join the Hoovernauts - an elite team of combat specialists operating in space and led by a military general known only by his code name: Hoover. It's your job to protect the planet, invade hostile space bases, and train against other Hoovernauts. The universe will never be the same.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat to expect in the game:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- campaign mode level 1 with 4 difficulties: easy, medium, hard, and bonus<br/>\r\n- campaign mode level 2 with 1 difficulty<br/>\r\n- arena mode (player vs. player) where you can battle friends and/or CPUs<br/>\r\n- local multiplayer support for all game modes (1-4 players)<br/>\r\n- special abilities such as overshields and jetpacks<br/>\r\n- weapons such as the laser beamer and laser pistol<br/>\r\n- powerups such as upgraded armor and enhanced ability<br/>\r\n- space enemies such as the alien spaceship, flaming skull, mothership, and shadow<br/>\n<br/>\r\nImportant Note:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA game remote such as an Xbox One controller is required for each player.
