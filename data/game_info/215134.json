We plan to have:</p>\n<p>-Bug fixes</p><p>-More music</p>\n<p>-More\u00a0sound effects</p>\n<p>-Smoother presentation</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This is a demake of the 2016 title <em>Zero Time Dilemma</em>, available on\u00a03DS, Vita, PC, and PS4. It is the third entry in\u00a0the <em>Zero Escape</em>\u00a0trilogy. Our goal was to demake it\u00a0into the style of the first entry\u00a0in the trilogy,\u00a0<em>Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</em>, originally released in 2009\u00a0for the Nintendo DS.</p>\n<p>This is just one isolated scene from the original game, which is much larger in scope. Its story follows characters who are forced to play a death game and are split into 3 teams by a mysterious, unknown person. You will be playing as Diana, the leader of D-Team. Sigma and Phi accompany you, who have a long history and strong bond with each other.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>The original games were heavily referenced in terms of aesthetics, structure, and writing. All music is original and mimic the style of the <em>Zero Time Dilemma</em>.</p>\n<p>Made within 11 days.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Aaron Teune (Vashsan278) - Code (Twitter,\u00a0Twitch)\r\n</p>\n<p>Jacob Smith (Binary Shred) - Art &amp;\u00a0Design\u00a0(Tumblr,\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Twitch)</p>\n<p>Sarah Hsi (Nocturnal Adagio Music) - Music (YouTube,\u00a0Website)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\"Zero Time Demake\" is entirely a fan creation and has no affiliation to the official games.\u00a0\"Zero Time Dilemma\", \"Zero Escape\", and its characters are a product of Spike Chunsoft.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b3a218fdcf9a190c5f133f6f6cbc42a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Binary Shred", "Vashsan278"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
