The first two weeks of my CompSci degree were called\u00a0'Coding Bootcamp' and during this time we were given a crash course on how to code using Java and the\u00a0'Processing' IDE.\u00a0The objective of 'Coding Bootcamp' was to produce a game in under two weeks, the final\u00a0day would be a demo\u00a0where we would all present what we had created to our lecturers and peers.</p>\n<p>I couldn't think of a better way to start a CompSci degree, 'Coding Bootcamp' really inspired me to try and make something I felt was really special. The concept of a juggling game set to the rhythm of a music track came to me very early and I put in a lot of work to get the feel and timing of the game right. The evening before the demo day was spent feverishly finishing the code and drawing up the visual assets for the game, then also coding the hands to rotate in place as a final touch.</p>\n<p>On the demo day itself I made sure to get set up on one of the projectors, I couldn't help be very proud of what I had created and wanted to see what reactions I would get. Feedback was immensely positive and one lecturer even asked me 'Are you sure you haven't done coding before?'. Coding Bootcamp and this game will always be a fond memory.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move the mouse to move the paddle, keep all the balls in the air until the end of the song.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0<strong>www.bensound.com</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a4779dfb15ed637ecb72f041d1d54ee0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Graham"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
