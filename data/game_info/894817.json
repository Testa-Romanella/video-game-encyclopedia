A team of students and I took heavy inspiration from\u00a0<em>Galaga</em> and\u00a0<em>Ikaruga</em> and came up with this in about two weeks. It's very obviously still a prototype (I mean... the debug messages are still visible...), which means the gameplay is incredibly short. I hope to update the point system to work more like a traditional arcade game as soon as I have time. So, patches to come!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>P.S.\u00a0\u00a0Exit the game using the <strong>ESC</strong> key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T09:38:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20e/20ed7ee98dedcc7d65979541be11abc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuamInfinitum Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
