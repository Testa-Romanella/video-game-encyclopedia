If yes, the enemy piece is destroyed, if not, your piece retreat to its original place.</p>\r\nWhy?\r\n<p>Because I love paper RPGs and dices and I kinda like chess but i am really bad at it so this game kinda level the plainfield for people like me who are really bad at the game.</p>\r\nFuture plans\r\n<p>Note that all those plans may never happens because it would take time and i don't really have time. But if this game generate enough interest, i'll be glad to try to take down that list.</p>\n<ul><li>General fixes and rework : the game should be stable but it need a lot of love to be able to welcome all the changes bellow\r\n</li><li>Bots will be improved if I find time for it. This current \"dumb as a rock\" bot was just to test the concept of bot actions.</li><li>I will maybe try to make a <strong>multiplayer</strong> mode for the game. For now, \"local\" multiplayer is possible if you play on the same computer.</li><li>More different sets of units. And better UI.</li><li>better animations for the dice throw, even for the fight itself.</li><li>I have ideas to add more selectable sets of game-rules :\u00a0<ul><li>units having two dices, one for attack, one for defense.</li></ul><ul><li>units having healthpoints, so each time there is an attack, health is lost, and the game become a more complex (barely)\u00a0turn-based strategy game rather than a chess game.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy the concept and the idea and let me know in the comment if you wish for more.</p>\n<p>(and if you do, don't hesitate to tip :3)</p>\r\nLast Update : 0.0.3a\r\n<ul><li>Add animated dices during fights to make them a little more alive.</li><li>WebGL available (plz work plz work plz work).</li><li>Fix issue that would allow player to play during bot's turn.</li><li>Fix potential crash during bot capture of player piece.</li><li>Changing the way Player and movements are handle to prepare for potential online multiplayer gameplay.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T09:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/069/069bd9e4a74fb8c64caa62a9c1c4d342.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux"], "developers": ["Captain Nakou"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
