{"id": 772619, "slug": "lying-souls", "name": "Lying Souls", "name_original": "Lying Souls", "description": "Lying Souls\u2122 is an atmospheric, mysterious single player story horror game. You'll dive into a story in which nothing is as it seems. Find out the reasons behind what happened to your family back then. Your decisions will guide the course of the story.<h3>THE INCIDENT</h3>It was a while ago when all this happened. With time, the incident has calmed down. You don't know anything anymore and step by step you find out the truth and why it all happened.<h3>YOUR DECISIONS</h3>You are still on a dangerous path of darkness. Are you someone who runs away from problems or faces them? It is entirely your decision. Until today you have not received any answers. Now you are going to search for them yourself. Whether you succeed or not depends entirely on you.<br/><br/><br/><h3>LYING SOULS</h3>In Lying Souls\u2122 you'll enter a story in which you'll have to solve, in first person, the mysterious circumstances of a long-past incident in your family. You'll experience different parts of the story and you'll have to sort everything out. The gameplay is linear, but the story is not.<h3>MAIN FEATURES</h3><strong><ul><li>Interactive Story / Own Decisions:</li></ul></strong> You will obviously have to make a decision at some moments that will change the later course of the story for you. Smaller, not so obvious decisions &amp; actions are also part of this. Whether you will find out everything with your decisions is questionable.<br/><br/><strong><ul><li>Notes / Recordings:</li></ul></strong> You will come across a number of audio recordings and various writings and notes. They will help you put the story together. Not everything may always be clearly told / revealed and you will have to find your own explanation.<br/><br/><strong><ul><li>Random Events:</li></ul></strong> You will experience random events from time to time. These are not random \"paranormal\" events to create a mood, but are always part of the current story and gameplay when they happen.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T05:19:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c2/5c21df1f02ce50d9ea7d1bed079231f3.jpg", "website": "https://www.troxystudios.de", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Troxy Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Troxy Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
