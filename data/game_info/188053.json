The theme for the jam was \"Waves\".</p><p>You play as a Good Idea in it's most simple form. The longer you stay alive, the better the idea - just like in real brains!</p><p>Jump from brainwave to brainwave gathering nuggets of inspiration. Inspiration means points, and possibly improves the idea, or something. </p><p>Also, watch out for the Seeds Of Doubt, sworn enemies of Good Ideas. The Seeds only want to undermine the Good Idea, with their scathing remarks; claiming that the idea already exists (usually with video evidence). Oooh they make me so mad!</p><p>The background is comprised of imagery depicting conversations had during GGJ, as well as a healthy dose of other things I thought of for some reason.</p><p>Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49b/49bba1bc14d5fa0fdfffd7ede6404fc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Andrew Sargeant"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
