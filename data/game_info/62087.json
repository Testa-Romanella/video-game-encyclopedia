{"id": 62087, "slug": "not-without-you", "name": "Not Without You", "name_original": "Not Without You", "description": "<strong>\u201cNot Without You\u201d</strong> is a diabolically clever mobile 2D puzzle brain-teaser, in which some adorable creatures - called \u201cPilcri\u201d - have been kidnapped by a mad scientist, for experimentation! Your job is to help them escape, through the trap doors in each level. One caveat: all Pilcri move in unison, and must exit each level, together! Therefore, you must utilize the local environment to position them to successfully flee.<br/><br/>What better way to pass time than helping little creatures get back home! However, don't let the cuteness of the creatures (and environments) fool you... Each puzzle was designed by a mad scientist, after all. <strong>Not Without You</strong> is a fresh, modern take on classic puzzle mechanics. It is accessible to gamers of all ages, yet challenging enough for hardened problem-solvers.<br/><br/>Testing (more than a thousand players!) has shown that NWY is not only strong in gameplay, enjoyment and art, 94% of testers indicated that they\u2019ll refer this game to their friends. While targeted at mobile users, it is still addictive on PCs and Macs.<br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong><br/><br/>+ Move Together: Control multiple Pilcri at once. When one moves, they all move - in the same direction.<br/>+ So Many Puzzles: Tons of levels to entertain, tease and challenge your mind.<br/>+ Beautiful Graphics in a Magical World: Hand crafted and ultra high-resolution 2D style. <br/>+ Regular Updates: To keep the game fresh and fun!<br/><br/>NWY is one of many titles in the Burnout Game Ventures' pipeline, a portfolio of which is provided by Adventure Beard, LLC, a joint venture between Bad Pilcrow, Inc.
