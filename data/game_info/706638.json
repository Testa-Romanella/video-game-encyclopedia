As a stray dinghy, wander around a vast, blue space. Talk to your new neighbors and figure out where you belong. This adventure is inspired by specific childhood memories, my own sailing experience, and the need to create a new home for myself.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse to move camera. WASD / arrow keys to sail. ESC key to exit the game. Press any key to advance dialog and interact with NPCs by running into them.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Navigational tip: sailing is a little awkward, as in Bitsy you move in just four directions. Keeping your mouse still might make it easier to mentally map which direction you are headed.</li></ul>\n<p>Special thanks to the 3D and audio Bitsy hacks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T16:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45d/45d5eebcea9cc22e2d33b860417a7a6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dani Moll Toste"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
