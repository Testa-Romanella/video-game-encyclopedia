The players start of in a lousy apartment, with no job or education. To win the game, the players have to get better jobs by educating themselves and through work experience. This might seem easy, but working and studying your ass off will turn the players into balls of stress. It almost seems like there is no time to relax! To win the game the player has to evenly juggle the 4 pillars of life itself, cash, well being, education and happiness.<br/>\r\nCompete against your friends locally, the computer or just try to beat the game in as few weeks as possible and beat your high-score.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-27T07:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3d/c3d3b03eb01e40c66e2edcf1619fac7c.jpg", "website": "https://www.notimetorelax.com", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 115, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 6, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 65, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Porcelain Fortress"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Porcelain Fortress"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
