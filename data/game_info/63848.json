Enjoy a gripping story, fun puzzles, debatable humour, an old man in spandex, plus a bit bit more!StoryMild-mannered handyman Roy Hardcastle had been Wallow Dale\u2019s local handyman for years. Hardworking and reliable, Roy was never short for work. But then, one day Roy began turning up to jobs dressed in a homemade superhero costume. He would no longer respond to the name of Roy and would only refer to himself as SUPER HELPFUL MAN. He unnecessarily pledged that he would protect the town of Wallow Dale from the evils of wear and tear, provide light repairs for those in need and face down any quibble, no matter how small! <br/><br/><br/>Nobody asked why Roy became SUPER HELPFUL MAN. It didn't seem healthy but he was still hardworking and reliable so it didn\u2019t really matter to them.<br/><br/>SUPER HELPFUL MAN went on to \u201cprotect\u201d Wallow Dale for as long as he could before finally succumbing to the evils of wear and tear on his aging body and weary mind. Unable to serve the town as he once could, SUPER HELPFUL MAN hung up the cape and was never seen again.<br/><br/>But, superheroes never really retire do they?<br/><br/>At 82 years old and with his superhero days long behind him, SUPER HELPFUL MAN spends most days doing odd jobs around the house for his nagging wife Meryl or sat alone in his shed reminiscing. It's at this exciting point where you jump in!<br/><br/>Join SUPER HELPFUL MAN as he decides, against better judgement, to suit up one last time to uphold that pledge he made to Wallow Dale over 40 years ago - NO QUIBBLE TOO SMALL!
