Fight your way through hostile skies in search of profit, but be wary of enemy pirates or you may become a groundship. Customize your combat methods aboard your vessel\u00a0(the Grimm Dawn), collect some booty, and send your foes down to Davey Jones' Locker.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Fly your airship through the skies, shooting down all in your path to claim their gold for your own. Line up your enemies for a broadside, or take them out with a mighty shot from The Grimm\u00a0Dawn's massive forward mounted cannon. Either way, they'll feel your fury.</p>\n\n<p>You can play Stratus with either a Mouse and Keyboard or Controller, it's up to you!<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Pitch: W/S or Left Stick Y</li><li>Yaw: A/D or Left Stick X</li><li>Speed:\u00a0R/F or Right/Left Bumper</li><li>Camera: Mouse Movement or Right Stick</li><li>Zoom: Scroll or D-Pad Up/Down</li><li>Fire: Left Mouse or Right Trigger</li></ul>\n\n<p>Art:</p>\n<ul><li>Lex Landry: UI Development, Modeling and Texturing, Pre- and Post-Production Assets</li><li>Shemar Calvin: Environment Modeling and Texturing, Particle Effects</li><li>Seth Daigle: Character Modeling and Texturing, Particle Effects, Level Design, Lighting, Post Processing</li></ul>\n<p>Programming:</p>\n<ul><li>Drew Funderburk:\u00a0</li><li>Gage Peters:\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>(Developed in Unreal Engine\u00a04.25)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T07:32:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b05b0daed2cdeabf6fc6fc8efc503dc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stratusgame"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
