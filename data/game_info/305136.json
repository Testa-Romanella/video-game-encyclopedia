It follows the story of Char 1 an AI in a small exe only called \"WIP\" located on an empty windows 99 like system. He asks you the player to help him find his way through the stages to disable his AI to get some rest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I started this game to try incorporating some story into a game and it started to develop over time and i ended up getting quite attached to it. I didn't expect it to be so well received by people. And if you haven't played it, i hope you like it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>FOLLOW ME!\u00a0https://twitter.com/ROCo_Games</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c70/c708f44e333c1e2df5b5f8ad3b954724.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ROCoGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
