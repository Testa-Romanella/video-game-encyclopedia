It was made in three weeks by me,\u00a0Abigail Yaffe, and my peer Paris Stacy.</p>\n<p>There is no interaction that happens when you place runes, but the thought is that in further iterations of the game there will be puzzles associated with this.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Book: A compendium of all the runes, space for you to take notes is here, your goal is to fill out this book by exploring the island and using your other tools.</p>\n<p>Map: Look at the map to figure out how to orient yourself on this strange island.</p>\n<p>Compass: Use the compass along with the map to orient yourself and figure out the meanings of different runes.</p>\n<p>Rune Crafting: Select one of the runes and place it on the ground.\u00a0Does anything happen? No, but now you have a rune on the ground.</p>\n<p>Day/Night Cycle: Watch the sun rise and set, it allows you to see different things with different kinds of light.</p>\n<p>Lantern: Put your lantern away when it's day and take it out at night in order to see things in different ways.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T05:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fe/7fe4ef662529d0cafede0df576c629e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kirijo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
