Trash has been scattered over the whole sea and using your boats, you can take them out. Remember: The more trash you're holding, the slower your boat will move. Once you have got enough trash, you have to go back to your base (area next to your spawn location), where trash will be taken from you. For every trash piece, you gain one point. At the end of match, all collected trash will be counted.
