Flippy the robot has lived a normal life, but when it comes time to show he knows how to platform, he discovers a series of trials and tribulations that he must look at from every angle. If he doesn't account for certain factors, it would mean his certain demise. Flippy must travel upwards in each of the rooms, resulting in the rooms rotating 180 degrees, where he must go back down to where he came from.</p>\n<p>If \"What goes up, must come down,\" Flippy has to climb upwards, only to then make the same journey 'down,' after rotation.
