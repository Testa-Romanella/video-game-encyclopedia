Easy to play but hard to master, it requires great strategy if you aim for a hi-score while dodging bullets across 12 hand-drawn, steampunk aesthetic stages, set in South America at the end of the 19th century, in an alternate universe.</p>\n<p>Evorales is inspired by the classic games of the mid-90s but with a Danmaku twist.</p>\n<p>The first time you play it might seem like a very difficult game, but mastering the [i]Alma[/i] and [i]Ultra[/i] modes is the key to finishing the game and getting amazing scores.</p>\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n<ul>\n<li>12 levels with their respective bosses, plus a hidden level.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>On arcade mode you can choose different paths every time.</li><li><p>Different types of damage.

Our villain does not stand out for his wickedness or his power, but for his envy to his neighbors, reaching the point of making a pact with a gnu-demon. It will give him the secret of the Alma technology, which will transform a normal army into a powerful gnu-demon force able to defeat its neighbors.</p>\n<p>However, not everything is lost, since intel has managed to copy and implement this new technology, creating prototypes capables to standing up to the gnu-demon army.</p>\n<p>Will these prototypes change the course of war?</p>\n<p>Can you take command of these mighty aircrafts and control the Alma technology?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Move the ship with the arrow keys or digital axes if using a controller.</p>\n<p>Use the \"Z\" key on your keyboard or the \"X\" button on your controller to fire, holding it down will give you a powerful but focused shot that will do a lot of damage to units directly in front of the ship. This mode consumes extra power from the motors, so the speed of the ship will be reduced.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Quickly press the button to generate a less powerful but wider shot, ideal for covering a larger area of the screen, but enemies will take longer to fall.<br/>You can also hold down the \"A\" key or the \"RB\" button instead of quickly pressing the \"X\".</p>\n\n<p>Toggle between \"Alma\" mode and normal mode with the \"Z\" key or the \"A\" button on the controller. When activating the \"Alma\" mode, it will be invulnerable, it will enter bullet time and the shot will be a powerful laser.<br/>The \"Alma\" mode consumes soul energy, keep an eye on the blue bars to avoid running out of energy.<br/>Soul energy can be recharged by picking up energy items that some enemies drop or by brushing against enemy bullets.</p>\n<p>Use the \"C\" key or the \"B\" button to deploy a bomb, this does not give immunity.<br/>Olegario's ship has a special function, depending on how long the button is held down, the distance at which the bomb will explode will vary.</p>\n\r\nFAQ\r\n<p><strong>What engine is Evorales programmed with?</strong><br/>Evorales is programming on the NET Framework 4.5 and the SFML library.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum requirements to play?</strong><br/>A computer with a dual-core CPU no less than 2 GHz, 2 GB of RAM and a directX 9 compatible video card is recommended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T07:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6a/d6a686415d84bc0614ea6116bde3dab6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hechelion"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
