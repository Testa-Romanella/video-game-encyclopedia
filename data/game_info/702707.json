But this harmony gets cracked after the disappearance of a Beastiemaster.

They like to brawl our Beasties ;)<br/><br/><br/><strong>Improve your Beasties</strong><br/>Our friends, the Beasties, receive primordial dust plates as loot after winning battles. With them you'll improve their abilities. In this way, you can upgrade each Beastie individually by investing in health, defense, strength and special abilities. You decide how to set up your team based on your strategy!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Exploring</strong><br/>To reward Exploring, within the world there will be hidden objects and random events with special loot. Use your time to collect important resources and prepare for the next adventure phase, challenge beastie trainers or search for new beasties in the tall grass.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Inspired by</strong><br/>Nexomon<br/>Pok\u00e9mon<br/>Gems of Ware<br/>Puzzle Quest<br/>Puzzle &amp; Dragons", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T05:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16d/16dd878b66c05588b1c8375a14893ac5.jpg", "website": "http://www.rokaplay.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 301, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rokaplay"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["rokaplay"], "esrb_rating": null}
