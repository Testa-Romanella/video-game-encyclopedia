She happens to have her birthday in <strong>Halloween</strong>, and I wanted to make a quick game to test some of the systems I was working on<br/></p>\n<p>It seemed a good idea, both in terms of Unreal Engine\u00a0practice and interesting level ambientation and characters.</p>\n<p>I already had a lot of systems pre-made, although the game demanded the implementation of new dialogue and tutorial systems. The art and sound was build using\u00a0purchased asset packs for faster development. The project took 2.5 extenuating weeks to complete.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player avatar and end video (which were some family best wishes)\u00a0have been replaced with placeholders for privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the Cemetery level (the second), there may be a bug that doesn't let the player complete one or both of the quests. The bug is quite expensive to fix, so it will have to wait. The way to the next level is open in any case after accepting the Spectre's quest and entering the cemetery fields. The player can also press keys 5 and 6 to complete the quests once they're accepted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T13:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33b57ffb035641c0f4fb01b269bfa3f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BroVader"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
