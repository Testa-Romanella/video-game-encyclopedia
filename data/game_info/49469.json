To stay alive, you will pit yourself against hordes of alien wildlife, robotic enemies, and an intensely hostile environment. If you survive, you will slowly build up an arsenal of weapons and special abilities by leveling up and exploring the world.<br/><br/><br/>Infinite Desolation is much more than a simple action game. Delve into the epic universe we\u2019re creating and discover deep character progression, exploration and looting, crafting, day/night cycles, environmental hazards, classic survival mechanics and world-jumping portals. You will be blown away by the depth of Infinite Desolation... if you aren\u2019t blown away by your enemies first.FEATURES<br/>Character Creation -<br/>Choose from one of 5 classes: Grunt, Psion, Scout, Engineer or Marine.
