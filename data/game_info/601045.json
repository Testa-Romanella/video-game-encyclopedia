Game", "description": "Trump, KEEP'N IT GREAT! is an indie Trump Game made by a solo developer. Most Apps are outsourced but this made by an American. A lot of hard work went in to this game.  An original game not a clone of somebody else's game.  This is my first app game.   <br/><br/>Play as President Trump as he takes on his political rivals in this political comedy platformer game.  Can Trump come from not so humble beginnings to become President of the United States?  Can Donald Trump beat the likes of Hillary Clinton, AOC, Adam Schiff, Joe Biden, Barrack Obama and many others?  <br/><br/>Use a multitude of silly weapons like a MAGA hat gun, hashtag gun, troll cannon, and tariff gun and so much more.  Play the game as Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Santa Trump when you unlock them.  Laugh or cry at this silly political satire game.  Play multiple story lines if you switch to Bernie Sanders for a different story.<br/><br/>Levels included<br/>*Run from Adam Schiff and the FBI in Trump Tower<br/>*Fly a Helicopter<br/>*Face off against Ted Cruz in the Primary<br/>*Pick Melania Trump in the Trump Limo<br/>*Beat Hillary Clinton<br/>*Build the wall<br/><br/>Help support me on my first indie app game, feedback appreciated!
