It will make those who hunt for you visible, almost like your own personal guide or\u00a0<strong>MAP.\u00a0</strong>But be careful, fire is a limited resource. When you run out, you must let your consumed fire burn out, or face the punishment of <strong>DEATH!!!</strong></p>\n<p>It was made with my friend and all assets were made by us, except a few of Unity's standard assets.</p>\n<p>Note: This game has heavy use of particle effects. If you know your PC can't handle this, please turn down graphics quality for good performance. Also do this if FPS drops below 30.</p>\n<p>#devsquad</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/003/0030c2d32fa04a13692b923ebcf1d9fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KliktrixStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
