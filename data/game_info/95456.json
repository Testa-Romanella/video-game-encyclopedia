He attempts to find his way back, to his world and recover the past. Collect strawberries, fight monsters, avoid spikes, solve puzzles.<br/></p>\n<p><em>The game was written in 48 hours during the Ludum Dare 40 game jam.</em></p>\n<p>Enjoying it, and what to see more? You can support me on patreon ;)</p>\n\n<p><em>He loves strawberries</em></p>\n<p>The game is written using tiny fantasy console, called\u00a0<strong>PICO-8</strong>. It limits you to use 16 color palette, 128x128px screen, 128x64px sprite space, 128x64 tiles map. I really enjoy using it, tho it is really limiting.</p>\n<p>The game has 25 levels,\u00a0<strong>including a BOSS LEVEL</strong>. I\u2019ve spend a lot of time and effort on making everything look great and smooth (just watch on some animations ;)). Game will automatically save your progress. Also, you can swap the palette on go (read menu part for that)!</p>\n<p>\u00a0I hope, that you will enjoy it!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Arrows</strong>\u00a0- move</li><li><strong>Z/C</strong>\u00a0- jump</li><li><strong>X</strong>\u00a0- double jump from evil essences</li><li><strong>Enter/P</strong>\u00a0- open the pause menu</li></ul>\n<p>Two main things, you need to know:</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Look for objects with tint, they will help you or kill you.</em>\u00a0<em>People miss those ropes a lot</em><br/></strong></li><li><em><strong>You can double jump from evil essences, once you touch them</strong></em></li></ul>\r\nSpeedrun mode\r\n<p>Yeah, I want to go through this quickly, there is a speedrun mode, build into the game! Once you kill the boss, you from the main menu can select any level, you want, and train on it.</p>\n<p>The game also shows you your time and death count on every death.\u00a0<strong>If you will speedrun it, let me know in the comments!</strong></p>\r\nMechanics (pss, spoilers!)\r\nJumping\r\n<ul><li>You can jump only from the ground</li><li>Trampolines launch you up into the sky</li><li>You can control your jump height, by holding the jump key longer/shorterRopes</li><li>You can\u2019t jump from ropes, only climb on them using arrowsKeys / berries</li><li>You need to deliver them to the door/exit to make use of themEvil</li><li>Once you use an essence, your screen becomes a bit more corrupted.

This option erases your save (except palette and boss flag).

I prefer the red and yellow one.</li><li>There is an options menu (activate it using enter), it contains a lot of useful stuff, as well as the palette settings</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>Is evil really so harmless?</em></p>\r\nChange log\r\n<ul><li><strong>v0.1d, v0.1f,</strong>\u00a0<strong>v0.1e\u00a0</strong>fix music not playing correctly</li><li><strong>v0.1c</strong> noise is not so annoying now</li><li><strong>v0.1b</strong> fixed kill() method issues, replaced default palette</li><li><strong>v0.1</strong>\u00a0Initial release for the compo</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac977eed1410d97001c222565d598c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["egordorichev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
