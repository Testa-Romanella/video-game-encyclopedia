This is my first game jam and one of my first real games. This game feature you taking on the role of\u00a0a brave sword who dares to save his kingdom from terrorizing monsters. The sword represents your being and your weapon<strong> joined together</strong> as one. Use yourself wisely!</p>\n<p>My idea in this jam was to join together game mechanics instead of opting for a game using this in the physical sense. The result was game that is quite basic and short but one who showed me the possibilities of limitations. Hope you all enjoy this sort of proof of concept\u00a0game and make sure to\u00a0tell me how you liked it in the comments!</p>\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>This game uses the mouse to direct yourself (The sword if you haven't gotten that) and upon a click you will be launched in the direction of its pointer. To advance to each level, the player must reach the stone pole bearing the red magic AFTER DEFEATING ALL THE MONSTERS! Press C to toggle the camera between the end post view and the player view. Also press R to restart an attempt on a level and P to pause. Good luck on your journey!</p>\n<p>You will also find a\u00a0rebound pole shows up with a green magical aura. This represents your only means of changing direction in this game. Make sure you you aim yourself well ;)</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All tileset art and sound fx were found on the opengameart.org website. Massive thanks to them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:12:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a13/a13a891a3f42f9b762092e07def855c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LGgameLAB"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
