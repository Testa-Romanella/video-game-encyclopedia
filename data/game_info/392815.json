Only a game play framework exists currently. You will be started next to a tornado with a random 'temperament' which can be deduced by the color they turn when you approach (white: shy, black: angry, grey: neutral). Try to get as many film (using the camera) or research (using the radar) points you can before the tornado disappears or catches you. The closer to the tornado you are, the more points you can receive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS BELOW:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys: Steering, Gas and Reverse</li><li>Esc: Exit to Menu</li><li>1: Turn on Radar</li><li>2: Turn on Video Camera</li><li>3: Turn off tools</li><li>Space: Scan (radar)</li><li>Mouse point: Aim Camera</li><li>Left Mouse Click (Hold): Record with camera</li><li>R: Restart (If caught), Roll upright (If turned sideways, a little buggy)</li><li>Z: Restart scene</li><li>Mouse Scroll or []: Zoom Camera\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T06:28:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cee/cee623af0649c94bf5b8885bd9182f41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sheep Shape Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
