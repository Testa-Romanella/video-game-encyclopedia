It was made at the request of people who tested our Match 3 story-driven project, which is under development. And there is no plot at all.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a Match 3 game. But not in the form that modern players are accustomed to. There are no levels, progress, or achievements in the game. It\u2019s more of the classic Match 3, as it was at times of the origination of this genre. The game has several modes that differ in a minor change in mechanics. One round is limited in time but playing well increases the time. Your goal is to take the highest possible positions in the players ranking by earning the maximum points during the game session", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T14:10:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ef/4efa42658bdbaa931da13449ff2baaf6.jpg", "website": "http://naarassusi-game.ru/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Naarassusi Game"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Naarassusi Publisher"], "esrb_rating": null}
