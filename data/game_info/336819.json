You want drivable tanks? Done. You want grappling hooks? Done. You want to be able to cast spells that turn your opponents into harmless rabbits? Done.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe reality of the matter is that since we're only two individuals working on this project in our spare time, there will likely be a lot of requests that we miss. But we hope to stay true to our roots and make a sh*tshow of a project that the whole family will love - just for you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n~Much love,<br/>\r\n~The Arkadia Galactic team~", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:10:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30c/30cc8a71bde7bbe1ca43b16a7fa11ab7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arkadia Galactic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Arkadia Galactic"], "esrb_rating": null}
