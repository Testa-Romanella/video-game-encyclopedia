There's a buncha clipping errors, typos I couldn't be bothered to fix, etc, but hey, I gotta get back on to other projects ,\u00a0 It's been mainly a learning project tbh but it comes up with funny things.</p>\n<p>Anyway if you like Twin Peaks, maybe you'll be in to it.</p>\n<p>Made for the game by it's cover jam, but released like, a month late due to life &amp; work things.<br/></p>\n<p>Builds coming in a day or two.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cab/cab7659d211503d0c169f7eb3bcb5677.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ocarson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
