The constraints, a camera tracking with switch from one star to another and a 'free' camera. Because of lack of time (and because I kept as well as possible the proportions, size and velocity which made the use of a free camera complicated, I could not apply a linear velocity, too fast to be precise, too slow to be able to walk around properly in the system) I preferred to put a UI and an acceleration / deceleration feature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are still some bugs (music that starts again from the beginning when you cut it and put it back), planet trails that when you accelerate lose a lot of precision (up to octagons or even squares or triangles), a bad management of the transition between fast and slow and other approximations and inelegance. The source code is unfortunately lost I could not correct all this, the project is here in the state of my knowledge and skills a few weeks after the beginning of my studies and a few days after my first Unity training. It's extremely sketchy but it's my first solo work and in spite of big design flaws (and realization... my god this u_u' font) it's close to my heart.<br/><br/>I hope you're enjoyed\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:17:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f57432e31a391ca2a404fd53623a7ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jb Dionisi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
