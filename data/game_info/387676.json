Still, I finally feel this is the best I can make it, and I figured it would work well to publish a story like this on Halloween.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do hope you enjoy it, and look forward to my next piece, hopefully in less than a year from now.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:38:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f73b52a36d44e278f6fbbf740acee3ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erra Ral"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
