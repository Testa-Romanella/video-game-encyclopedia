To access most of the islands you need the double jump upgrade which costs 100. It can be bought from the orange computer terminals such as the one on the crashed space ship and those scattered around the islands. Using the shop pauses the game so you're safe to buy ammo in a fight. If you run out of coins, your best option is to restart from a checkpoint using the pause menu (\"P\" key) so enemies will respawn. In the final zone beyond the portal awaits you a bossfight. The boss cannot be damaged when it's surrounded by a blue shield and when its health bar is dimly colored. If you run out of ammo, you can fight the robots that appear using your melee to get coins. There's a shop terminal in the final zone which you can use to buy ammo. After destroying the boss, the game should end in a few seconds.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T16:48:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/688445c01f4e52c937ab12de99bed8b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Spazi", "Knowko", "tarmodev", "Miika_A_Pekkala", "Jarppi", "Nenemo", "Nenko"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
