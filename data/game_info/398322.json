After just playing around, I wanted to produce something to show and demonstrate my current skills and experience. In order to make sure I actually FINISH something I started, I imposed a time limit on myself in order to apply pressure.\u00a0</p><p>I decided to limit myself to 4 days, as the day I decided to do this just happened to be 4 days before a game-dev related\u00a0event was occurring (Sac Gamers Expo 2019)(I did go to the event and met other devs as well). This limit was completely self imposed. It is not a part of any game developer challenge or game-jams.</p><p>I successfully managed to complete\u00a0this game in 4 days. Well, more like finish it at a satisfactory state. I can still see some places where I can add things (like map details). I was the only one who play-tested the game, so I hope it's still in a decent state. Overall, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish.</p><p>I included my documentation and development notes that helped me create the game. It is located in a folder called \"Developer Commentary\". It includes credits, contact information, and spreadsheets. The spreadsheets were made using Google Sheets. I've exported them into multiple formats: .xlsx, PDF (grid), PDF (no-grid).</p><p>Or you can read the madness that is my notes here:\u00a0(GoogleSheetLink)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T05:24:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef1/ef1b8bb5ee3bfba644d7531dd1088b00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WildThorn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
