I'm currently developing a top down version of a zombie survival shooter that draws heavily from COD Zombies. The current build is an extension of my original prototype but more fleshed out and refined.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can download the project below. In it's current state there are 23 weapons and unlimited rounds set alongside a very WIP map. I plan to actually make good maps for this, however I am considering procedurally generating maps so it might be some time before that gets implemented.\u00a0</p><p>EDIT: (12/5/2017) I've added abilities, Powerups, more weapon variants, and stats! Reworked the game a lot too. Expect a random level generator for the next iteration.</p>\n<p>Also disclamer I did NOT make the models or animations you see in this game. They were made by\u00a0Polygon Blacksmith. If you're in need of some awesome assets you should really check him out.<br/></p>\n<p>And as always I'd love to hear your comments, questions, bugs, or concerns at FyxeINC@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Happy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40fb74078fb1e1ab577cd5b1b4a65629.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fyxe"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
