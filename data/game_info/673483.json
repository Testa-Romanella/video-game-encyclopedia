Fight against two different kind of enemies and two different bosses. Fight with either your sword or your bow whilst also doging attacks from enemies.</p>\n<p>The game used to have a working highscore system but in this version it isn't pressent due to it chrashing the game. You can still open the highscore menu and you are required to enter a name, but these things don't do anything anymore.</p>\n<p>Where monsters hide was a game made for the first school project at our game development study. We worked on the game for about 6 months. We programmed the game in Java using the Prossesing librarys. We also made almost alle the sprite our selfs.\u00a0The dungeon tileset was copied from\u00a0HeartBeast\u00a0with some slight adjustments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T08:05:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd4880734a87ab783eab1f6d22096fff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheCyberOne"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
