I made this in a day, and finished at 4:00\u00a0AM.\u00a0It was heavily inspired by the UI of Evangelion and adhered it to the prompt for the week which was \"Slow\". After spitballing some ideas with some friends we came up with a slow typing game and so I ran with it. It's not perfect for sure, but it's exploring some cool ideas and it's my first strategy simulation game! If I had more time I would playtest it more and get rid of the individual boxes and build out the delayed typing mechanic more.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T05:00:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bb/9bb5dd4b2263fc9f8f2e0adc60fd6985.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John Wanamaker"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
