I am an artist with no previous experience in rpg maker or story writing. I made this game to learn and to also make my childhood wish of making a horror\u00a0RPG maker game come true. It's more of an exploration, roleplay game with a horror theme and elements.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>- The whole game ( art + story + programming + testing was made in just 2 weeks, so I'm sorry for the inconsistency and lack of polishing and story logic.
