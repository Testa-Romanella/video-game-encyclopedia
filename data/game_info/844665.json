I\u00a0found out that this was being used to also describe the tide. So I wanted to implement an\u00a0Ebb and Flow System. The Water Plugin is still experimental and it bugged out when\u00a0I scaled it, so my whole Idea could not be implemented. So I did this without the tide, and you can see for yourself what got out of it :).</p>\n<p>I started with only 3 days left and no Unreal Engine Experience and\u00a0I was surprised that I could build something so fast with Unreal Engine.</p>\n\n<p>Paid Assets:</p>\n<p>Atlantic Crab: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/atlantic-ghost-crab</p>\n<p>Beach Assets: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/olbert-s-low-poly-beach</p>\n\n<p>Free Assets:</p>\n<p>Quixel: Sand</p>\n<p>Eating Sound: https://opengameart.org/content/rabbit-eating<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T07:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/268/2689e1c80efe6aa075338a5061f9ff7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BennyDeeDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
