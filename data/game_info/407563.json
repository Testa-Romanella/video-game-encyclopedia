Roguevania!\nYou grew up with the roguelikes, witnessed the rise of the roguelites and even the birth of the roguelite-lites? We'd now like to present for your consideration our RogueVania, the illegitimate child of a modern Roguelite (Rogue Legacy, Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Spelunky, etc.) and an old-school MetroidVania (Castlevania: SotN and its ilk).\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n<ul>\n<li>RogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.</li>\n<li>2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, more than fifty weapons and spells with unique gameplay, and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble. </li>\n<li>Nonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Remparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style or just your mood.</li>\n<li>Exploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea mist infused air...</li></ul>\n<br/><br/>\nInterconnected levels and progressive unlocking of access to the island provides you with a real incentive to explore your surroundings. Add in a degree of evolution for your character and permanent weapon upgrades and you can see where Dead Cells borrows from the long line of MetroidVanias that precede it.\n<br/><br/>\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly getting better, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Unforgiving combat wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run and unrivaled replayability.\n\n\n\nDead Cells left In Development on August 7th 2018 and comes with:\n<ul>\n<li>14 Levels - Each one with its own atmosphere, foes and secrets to discover.</li>\n<li>3 Bosses - Made by the most sadistic of the devs, raised on the salt of the testers.</li>\n<li>60 or so weapons and skills - Spears, swords, bows, freeze blast, etc.</li>\n<li>4 special powers, unlocking new areas and paths (metroidvania gear lock items).</li>\n<li>1 epic responsive, fluid and fun to play combat system.</li>\n<li>1 Daily Run Mode Complete with leaderboards for lording it over your mates.</li>\n<li>Hours of fun (depending on your skill, anything from 10 to 30 hours or more).</li>\n<li>A few rage-quits, Ok a lot of rage quits\u2026 But you\u2019ll git gud\u2026 Eventually.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/><br/>Dead Cells: Rise of the Giant\nA FREE DLC!?!? ARE YOU MAD?:Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we\u2019ve been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the community. Without your support and feedback we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you. Here\u2019s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it\u2019s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFeatures:<ul><li>New levels: You\u2019ve got a new level that\u2019s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who\u2019s finished the game at least once. You\u2019ve got another (poorly) hidden level, for the masochists who know that there is a Boss Cell 5\n<br/>\n</li><li>New Bosses: Mirroring the above, you\u2019ve got a new completely different type of boss available in the main level structure, with another INSANELY difficult boss hidden behind even more ridiculously difficult content.\n<br/>\n</li><li>New content: There are 10 new enemies, 13 new weapons/skills and a bunch of other upgrades to core game systems. There are additions to the story/lore of the game, new secrets, new blueprints and\u2026\n<br/>\n</li><li>Skins: People have been requesting this for ages and we\u2019ve finally found the time to make the necessary changes to accomadate the request. You\u2019ve now got access to female skins, fluro skins and a christmas tree skin, cos why the hell not.</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of these major changes we\u2019re continuously trying to update the game in ways that make it more challenging and more just, all the while remaining open to new players. As such you will notice that the difficulty has been rebalanced so that the entry level of the game, while extremely challenging is now in line with the 5 extra difficulty levels available to those who like to suffer.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe hope that you like Rise of the Giant and would like to remind you that we\u2019re not done, we\u2019ll be continuing to make content for the game for as long as you keep demanding it, so feel free to let us know what you\u2019d like to see and if we can make any changes that would make you happy.\n\n<br/><br/>Dead Cells: The Bad Seed\n\nExplore a relaxing Arboretum, wade through a noxious Swamp and take on a new boss in this new early game content designed to expand the Dead Cells universe and add variety to runs for people who want to support the development of the game.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHarvest a few souls with your new scythe.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you\u2019ll be able to play through:\n<br/>\n<ul><li>The Arboretum: A relaxing and peaceful greenhouse inhabited by a peaceful clan of mushrooms, with an understandable desire to murder the Beheaded.\n<br/>\n</li><li>The Swamp: A noxious environment ruled by a band of tree dwelling mutans with pointy sticks, sneaky dart shooting frogmen and a bunch of deadly bloodsuckers.\n<br/>\n</li><li>The Heart of the Swamp: Domain of mama tick, if you\u2019ve seen StarShip Troopers, you get the idea...</li></ul>\n<br/>\nThe two new levels and their monsters are alternatives to The Courtyard/Toxic Sewers and The Ramparts/Ossuary/Ancient Sewers, with the boss designed to be on par with The Concierge, so hopefully it\u2019ll spice up your early game runs once you\u2019ve played through the core game.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nTake on these nasty biting blighters.Why Paid DLC?\nWe\u2019ve been releasing free updates for Dead Cells for over a year now, this paid DLC is designed to support that effort, allow us to expand the game even more and ensure that Motion Twin have the time they need to make their next game one they\u2019ll be proud of and you\u2019ll be stoked to play.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs usual we\u2019re going to do this right, so if you\u2019re not happy with the cost of the DLC, the quality of the update or have suggestions, ideas for other ways of continuing to pay for the team or anything at all, leave us a review, or come and ask us directly via Reddit or Discord.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-02T08:40:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f952529ce33b85b5f5a77b3ac253fbda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 453, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Motion Twin", "Evil Empire"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Motion Twin"], "esrb_rating": null}
