You start in a hospital and then you leave the body and fly into a near death experience with light,  and amazing sounds..exciting and intresting. A fantasy about a near death experience, hopefully joyable for you, no mechanics in interaction, only press one button to start and after that only follow the flow and enjoy the ride<br/>\n<br/>\r\n We do not want to spoil this mythical, mystical experience with to many pictures in advance.<br/>\r\nIn Virtual reality, the brain believes that what it is experiencing is really happening.  As VR developers, we are filled with the feeling of doing things in VR that is impossible in the ordinary world. Near-death experiences have repeatedly been described in books with words and pictures, but doing it in VR creates a completely unique experience that it seems to happen for real; you lift, fly further into another dimension with light phenomena, otherworldly sounds, or hover without a body.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis experience can be amazing even if you do not believe in the phenomenon itself more than as physical, chemical processes in your mind.<br/>\r\nFor us, it is up to everyone whether they believe in life after death or not. Our purpose is to release the taboo around death and the fear of being touched and that we can approach conversations and thoughts about death.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nbidragsgivare kulturbryggan", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T04:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01e/01e7063fdb75cb2af081506af309d1ef.jpg", "website": "https://www.virtualrehab.eu/virituella-dodsogonblick/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carolina Ask", "Virtual RehabART4Health VR design: \u00c5sa Egn\u00e9r Programmer: Johnny Nyman  Musician and composer: Hans N"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VirtualRehabART4Health"], "esrb_rating": null}
