The first person to 10,000 points ends the game and everyone gets one last turn to try and get the most points. If you farkle (none of the dice rolled are scoring) you lose your points for that turn and play moves to the next player. If you are lucky enough to get hot dice (all dice in a roll score) then you can choose to extend your turn and try to get more points. The in-game help system will help you with what dice combinations are scoring combinations. Your personal top 10 high scores are kept for future reference including your win/loss records. You can also submit your scores to an online leader board which will keep track of your highest score. Compete with your friends to see who can get higher on the online leader board.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e6142f08fa0812e8e62b140ebc02cca2.jpg", "website": "http://www.hunter-gaming.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jason Crosby"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Jason Crosby"], "esrb_rating": null}
