It's good for a quick distraction that starts slow and easy before becoming frenetic and difficult.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T00:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd32cb426fbc7bf7faabb36c34e8ac63.jpg", "website": "https://eon.pengaru.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["neogames", "pengaru.com"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["pengaru.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
