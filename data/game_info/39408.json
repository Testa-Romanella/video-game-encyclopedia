The more objects that the Prince rolls up, the larger his katamari becomes, allowing him to roll up bigger items. </p>\n<p>The Prince faces his toughest challenge ever as Katamari Forever boasts the largest collection of stages, modes, songs, and cousins to date. Remixed classic Katamari Damacy tunes, a brand-new storyline, multiple new visual effects and 1080p graphics round out Katamari Forever into the ultimate Katamari experience ever. A terrible event has occurred causing the stars to disappear from the night sky and the King of All Cosmos to fall into a coma. </p>\n<p>The Prince must use his finely tuned Katamari rolling skills once more to re-create the absent celestial bodies, save his royal father and restore order to the Cosmos. Thumb tacks, sushi, cats, people, skyscrapers, ocean liners and continents - nothing is safe as the Prince makes his way through the largest variety of stages in a single Katamari game ever. </p>\n<p>New graphical styles give Katamari Forever a certain &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot; that all new Katamari games possess. A few of the new styles include Wood, which uses warm sepia tones to give stages a wooden feel, while Comic creates thick black outlines on every object while filling them in with deep, rich colors. Make sure to try them all out and find your favorite for a totally new way to experience the world of Katamari. In addition to all these great new features, Katamari Forever also contains local cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. Choose your favorite cousin and play together or compete in heated Katamari competition.
