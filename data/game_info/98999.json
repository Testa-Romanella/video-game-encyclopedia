{"id": 98999, "slug": "deadeye", "name": "DeadEye (itch)", "name_original": "DeadEye (itch)", "description": "DeadEye \r\n<p>\r\n\tDeadEye is an open world multiplayer survival game set in the Wild West. Players can explore a huge, living environment filled with unique towns, landmarks, NPCs and quests.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game does not by any means reflect the given description yet, however my goal is to make DeadEye a truly great survival game. Since I am working by myself development takes a lot of time. Especially visually the game will stay in a very basic state and will mostly make use of placeholder assets for now.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDeadEye has been entirely developed on stream. You can watch me work live on Twitch, Links below. <br/></p>Current Status:<p>- 11th March 2018 -<br/></p><p>I haven't worked on DeadEye for a while now. Didn't really find the time to work on it due to school. I will get back into the project now and make plans for future development. As of right now there are <strong>no servers</strong> available, I will make sure to get a server up and running again in the next weeks. Thanks for the patience, I will keep you guys posted ! <br/></p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\n Pre-Alpha \r\n<p>\r\nThe game is  actively being developed but currently still in pre-alpha. Players can help to shape and improve the game by giving feedback and submitting bugs and errors.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRead the \r\n\tDevblog for more detailed Information on the current Version.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nPlayer Account\r\n<p>\r\nAs of v.0.1.4 an Account is needed to play, the only reason for these Accounts is that the Game Servers need to be able to identify you as a unique player. Making an Account only requires an Username and Password, no Email or anything else.\r\n</p>\r\nPre-Alpha 0.1.6.1\r\n<p>Planned to be released 21st of July. (delayed)</p>\n<p>Server Side Refactoring is done. Client Side still needs some work.</p>\n<p>I am currently working on refactoring most of the Code that makes up both the Client and Server for DeadEye. This will help to keep the project organized and make it easier to add new content\u00a0in the future. That process will take some time and effort so an update with new features will be delayed.</p>\r\nPlanned Features:\r\n<ul><li>Basic NPCs</li><li>Torch</li><li>General Stability Improvements and Bug Fixes</li></ul>\r\nPre-Alpha 0.1.6\r\n<p>\r\n\tReleased 14th of May.\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Global Text Chat</li><li>Reworked Hit Detection (Projectile System)</li><li>Performance Improvements</li><li>General Stability Improvements and Bug Fixes</li></ul>\r\nPre-Alpha 0.1.5.3\r\n<p>Released 14th of April.</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Bug Fixes</li></ul>\r\nPre-Alpha 0.1.5.2\r\n<p>\r\n\tReleased 6th of April.\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Day and Night Cycle</li>\n<li>Graphical Improvments </li>\n<li>General Stability Improvements and Bug Fixes</li>\n</ul>\r\nBug Tracking\r\n<p>\r\nIf you encounter any bugs please report them \r\n\there.
