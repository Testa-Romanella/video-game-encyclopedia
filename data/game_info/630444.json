But she didn't know that the mirror she used was holding a demonic entity in it. Will that spell be a blessing for the girl... or a curse?</p>\n<p><strong>The game contains:</strong></p>\n<p>* Gorgeous arts and backgrounds</p>\n<p>* Video movies</p>\n<p>* Simple, but touching story</p>\n<p>* Playtime that varies from 30 minutes to 3 hours</p>\n<p>* 4 endings</p>\n<p><strong>Note 1: The game wasn't made by us (Patchy Illusion Team), but we have the developer's permission to translate and share it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Note 2 (important!):</strong>\u00a0This game contains video movies, and since Easy RPG Player isn't able to play movies yet, it's highly reccommended to play the game through either \"Fullscreen\" or \"Windowed\" launcher. However, the fullscreen mode could still give an error on playing movies, and so for easy solution you can just switch the game to the windowed mode (F4). For solving the problem in a bit more complicated way you can check the \"Problems and Solutions\" file in the game's folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> the game contains dark themes, mentions of death, animal death and drug abuse.</p>\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n<p>Game's page on freem:</p>\n<p>https://www.freem.ne.jp/win/game/16354</p>\n<p>Official developer's page:</p>\n<p>http://frog4151.web.fc2.com</p>\n<p>Developer's twitter:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/frog4151</p>\n<p>Translators page:</p>\n\n<p>https://scans.uboachan.net/about.html<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-13T19:53:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53c/53c35388281d968063b6c7c2429ebf7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 355, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Amber318"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
