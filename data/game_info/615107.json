Although this game is playable on PS5, some features available on PS4 may be absent. See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.<br/>Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death.<br/><br/>To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>\u2022 Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world!<br/>\u2022 Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective.<br/>\u2022 Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive.<br/>\u2022 Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style.<br/>\u2022 Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!<br/><br/><br/>Offline single player<br/><br/><br/>Online features require an account and are subject to terms of service and applicable privacy policy (playstationnetwork.com/terms-of-service &amp; playstationnetwork.com/privacy-policy). <br/><br/>Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense). <br/><br/>One-time license fee for play on account\u2019s designated primary PS4\u2122 system and other PS4\u2122 systems when signed in with that account.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T04:27:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f6/5f6798ccb2ed34880df02a255ef745fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
