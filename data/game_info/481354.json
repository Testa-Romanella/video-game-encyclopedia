If this goes further I am quite positive it will be in 128x128 mode and some of the look&amp;feel (particularly user UI) will get a full rework to better use space and all</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:38:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/14809aa09e82dfd3ea5f11c5d03a2bf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SlainteES"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
