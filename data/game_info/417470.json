It isn\u2019t easy to find the truth, so what to do? Here it hit me; what if I make a game that re-creates the events which formed the industry and try to bring the most accurate facts without being biased to any side? And allow the player to explore different info and ask about them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:19:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cd/1cdba371ce0949bf565e624c3bbef936.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cookiesliyr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
