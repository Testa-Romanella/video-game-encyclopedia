Work hard, study hard, and play hard as a royal in training at the exclusive Archambault Academy.

You\u2019re being courted by every club and social group on campus; and there are countless students who would love to be your friend - or more. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, outside your school\u2019s ivy-covered walls, trouble simmers across the country as activists fight to open voting rights beyond the aristocracy. You can use your influence to sway the Parliament\u2019s decision - but in which direction?<br/><br/>Will you flaunt your fame, or retreat from the spotlight? And if you do seek publicity, will the papers love you or despise you?
