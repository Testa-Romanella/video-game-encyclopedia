{"id": 386808, "slug": "fasteroids-chaslinux", "name": "Fasteroids (chaslinux)", "name_original": "Fasteroids (chaslinux)", "description": "<p>Fasteroids began as a very simple black and white clone of Asteroids and has been evolving into the space shooter it is now. Avoid and shoot asteroids of various sizes. After wave 4 smaller asteroids appear when medium-sized asteroids are shot, the smaller the asteroid the more points. <br/></p><p>For even more points shoot the UFO's that appear. UFO's enter from either side of the screen and at various speeds - some are slow, some are very fast. Each 5 waves you're awarded a bonus ship. When you're on your last ship it flashes in the left corner of the screen.<br/></p>\n<p>Fasteroids is under continuous development with a number of other features coming soon. The downloadable is an executable, just download and run/no installing. At this point Fasteroids is available only for Windows.</p>\n<p>Thanks to ThinMatrix (gamedev inspiration), Shaun Spalding (first intro to GameMaker), and all the GameMaker Youtubers for their excellent tutorials and inspiring videos. Without them this game wouldn't have been possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:08:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4adf78cdd40742c1f73f6d4476c7a530.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chaslinux"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
