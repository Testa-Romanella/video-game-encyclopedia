You\u2019ll need to utilize the three forms of water to traverse the station and make it to the exit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a penguin made of water and you can transition into the three different forms of water! If you\u2019re in water (default) form, step on a burner to turn into gas form so you can fly. Watch out for fans though, they\u2019ll blow you away and disperse you! If you\u2019re in water form and go into a freezer box, you\u2019ll become ice form. This form can break walls but cannot jump, so keep that in mind! Going onto a burner as ice form will turn you into water form, and going into a freezer box as gas form will turn you into water form as well. Watch out for spikes too, they\u2019ll kill you no matter what form you\u2019re in!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Controls: Arrow Keys to move; Spacebar to jump\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Game Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Bryan Ambriz: Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Everette Webber: Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Yasmine Lee: Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Kendrick Haskins: Composer and Sound Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T07:21:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/963/963e8f8de086416baa15a18c892375a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digx7"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
