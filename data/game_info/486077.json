But things suddenly get uneasy as you see danger in every corner.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The first\u00a0TREPIDATION was for sure my most popular game, yet it was the most hated as well. I wanted to give it updates, but I had enough of that game for a while.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00a0\u00a0time\u00a0 went on I wanted to get back on\u00a0TREPIDATION but it was\u00a0obviously a messed up and rushed\u00a0game.\u00a0 So I started fresh with a sequel. This in my opinion is a huge improvement\u00a0from the first and really is a\u00a0Redemption. But whats your opinion?\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T05:48:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c09/c09ccd60afc0a6f1cfdfc0f6c57fe569.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["VIBEGAMES"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
