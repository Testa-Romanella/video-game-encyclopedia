This is a search and find micro game\u00a0 where you look for vampires in the middle of a costume party.</p><p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>You are a vampire hunter who received\u00a0 pictures of a trio of real vampires hosting a halloween party.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With your stake in hand you go there to kill those monsters but... Everyone kinda looks the same in their costumes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can you hit only the right targets? If a vampire smells even a drop of blood from their guests, they'll be gone in a second\u00a0and the party will be ruined...</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p><p>This is a pretty simple game!\u00a0</p><p>Just look for the images on the top right corner and try to find the same characters in the scene. When you do, click to stab them! And avoid clicking on others characters so you don't accidentally kill anyone in party!</p><p>If you enjoy the experience, be sure to play more than once - the vampires you are looking for change on each turn.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made with Unity for the Mini Jam 118: Vampires.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T06:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/847583414adc9707016480b4b7491c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["giucalistro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
