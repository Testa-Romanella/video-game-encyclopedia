This is the first jam I've actually participated in, and I'm honestly surprised by how productive one can become when a deadline is set. Will definitely participate again in the future.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Please do leave any feedback or possible bugs that you find, I might continue to work on this in the future, as I see a lot of potential in this game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (controller is recommended, no menu support though)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>PC:</p>\n<p>WASD (movement), Space (drift), ESC (menu), E (interact)</p>\n<p>Controller:</p>\n<p>R2(accelerate), Circle/B(Reverse), L2(Drift), Triangle/Y(interact), Start(menu)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Music by: Martin Lubeck a.k.a.
