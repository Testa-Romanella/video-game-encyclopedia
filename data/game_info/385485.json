When you hit the switch, a motor moves a mechanical arm to turn off the switch. It serves absolutely no purpose!   <br/><br/>This game is exactly like a Useless Box but better because it's a video game about hitting a switch on a Useless Box (still no purpose).  Want to spend hours flipping a switch and accomplishing nothing? This game is for you! As an added bonus, the box will tell you stories as well as reveal unlocks!<br/><br/>We're not sure how to better describe the game.  It's better if you just watch the video honestly.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Hit a button on a box!  What more could you possibly want?<br/></li><li> <strong>Dialogue / Story:</strong> Hit the switch to unlock semi-interesting dialogue.  Or not, staring at the box is totally cool too!<br/></li><li> <strong>Music:</strong> Hand picked music that you may or may not like! <br/></li><li> <strong>Game Length:</strong> Goes on as long as you want it to.  Useless Box will always be here for you!<br/></li><li> <strong>Social Media / Multiplayer:</strong> There is none.  Enjoy not bugging your friends with useless things.<br/></li><li> <strong>Unlocks:</strong> Unlocks! </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T03:07:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca8/ca85cd9eab19317969bcacbab41aa6ab.jpg", "website": "http://vigorousapathy.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vigorous Apathy"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vigorous Apathy"], "esrb_rating": null}
