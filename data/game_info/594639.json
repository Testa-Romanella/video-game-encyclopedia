First you must use your high bounces to navigate out of your own lair before diving deep into enemy territory. But you must be careful. The crystals in the enemy\u2019s base will destroy you with a single touch! You can also play a Versus Mode where two players race to be the first to reach the end of the other\u2019s lair. You can even bounce into the other player and prevent them from progressing. Will you play the role of a speedster or a spoiler?</p>\n<p>This game supports both keyboard and controller.</p>\n<p><strong>P1 Controls:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Move: Arrow Keys\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump/Bounce: Z, Space, Up\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>P2 Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Move: WASD\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump/Bounce: G, L, W</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Dan Fornace -\u00a0Programming, Design, Art</p>\n<p>RESOFORCE - Music, Sound Effects</p>\n<p><strong>Engine:</strong></p>\n<p>Game Maker Studio 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T10:17:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02d/02d9e42930fee3bb36c7656e84cf7cd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["danfornace"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
