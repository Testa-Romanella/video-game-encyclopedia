By being honest, you can make new friends and gain confidence. But like in real life sometimes you say the wrong thing without realizing it and that social snafu leads to you losing confidence. \u00a0Some characters will be pretty intimidating, so you\u2019ll need a lot of confidence to speak with them.</p>\n<p>If making new friends is proving difficult, you can try drinking to boost your confidence. However, drinking makes it harder to communicate by scrambling your dialogue choices. If you drink too much you won\u2019t have any idea of what you\u2019re trying to say until you\u2019ve already said it. </p>\n<p>Having enough confidence allows you to talk to more and more intimidating members of the party, until you finally have enough confidence to talk to Ivy, your school crush.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Featuring the Game Design work of Emi Schaufeld and Michael Fegreus</p>\n<p>The coding and unity development of Michael Fegreus and Rebecca Jones, with Yarn assitance from Harry Rabinowitz and Emi Schaufeld</p>\n<p>\r\nBrilliant writing by Harry Rabinowitz, Emi Schaufeld and Magnolia Porter</p>\n<p>Art: <em>I Wanna Go Home</em> features hand drawn characters, backgrounds, and animations by our amazing artists and illustrators.
