It's all about balls and twist locks. You have to arrange the balls in the right order to pick the lock. What sounds simple enough quickly turns out to be a uniquely tricky game.<br/><br/>Collect four balls of the same color in a twist lock and blow them up. To beat a level, you have to pick each lock at least once. Every level adds new elements like traffic lights, one-way streets and color changers, and you also have to keep an eye out for the indestructible black balls!<br/><br/>!nsane features 50 exciting levels that really get your brains working. The difficultly increases progressively. Its initial levels are easy, but !nsane rapidly becomes an absorbing and addictively intricate puzzle!Features<ul><li>Cult game remake<br/></li><li>Classic \"Logical\" rules<br/></li><li>50 challenging levels<br/></li><li>Loads of game elements like traffic lights, one-way streets and color changers<br/></li><li>Progressive difficulty</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a110b4b4f2e35fc4da099719ae674b07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 40}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["VIS - Visual Imagination Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["United Independent Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
