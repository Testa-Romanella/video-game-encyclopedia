{"id": 569813, "slug": "maverick-itch-itcreationz", "name": "MAVERICK (itch) (itcreationz)", "name_original": "MAVERICK (itch) (itcreationz)", "description": "<p>My first interactive story I created was entitled \u201cMaverick the Great\u201d. I enjoyed writing this story because it was an exaggerated story about my dog Maverick. For my superhero story, I wanted to expand on the story and make it into human form. I gave him similar wants and needs as the superhero dog. This time as a human, Maverick wants to be a normal teenage boy and is embarrassed to tell anyone about his superpowers. He is afraid that people will judge him and not look at him the same. He knows that his powers are used to help people and he is good at saving the day. His wants and needs differ because his want is not necessarily something he wants but is all in his head. He enjoys helping people, but Maverick has a shy personality. He is not your superhero who wants to boast or get any credit for his actions, yet he wants people to have good days without any excess mayhem. At the end of the day Maverick knows he needs to use his powers for good because people really need them. I believe when people play my game, they will want to go back and choose the opposite choices just to see where the story takes them. I thought my storyline would be different from other superhero stories because I think most superheroes embrace their powers, but struggle with different things in their personal lives. For example, Maverick\u2019s friends witness a robbery, and he can disappear and help diffuse the situation. After everything is handled, Mavericks friends tell him that he missed what happened and that this unknown superhero saves the day. His friends thought the situation was cool and even told Maverick that \u201che should have been there\u201d. The friends continue to talk about what they would do if they were superheroes and how they would use their power. This scenario makes Maverick wonder how his friends would react if they knew he was this superhero. When Maverick made the decision to stop the bank robber instead of standing back and watching with his friends, he knew that his powers were in his DNA. His saving the day nature is out of his control and he knows that being a part of Hero Nation is an honor. Eventually by the end of the story Maverick will learn to embrace his powers because the ultimate test will be saving someone he loves and cares a lot about. I wanted the story to have different plots that show the main character's thoughts and how he views certain situations. I would align the reader\u2019s interest with the character's motivations by expecting most of the readers to want to be a superhero. This would make them want to click on the options that send the character into action mode. Even if the reader's thoughts and decisions are different, both options display Mavericks' why of his wants and needs. It also shows two different reasons for having his character flaw.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/534/534a9415ced7ccabf7d6dc7dfbebb3ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["itcreationz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
