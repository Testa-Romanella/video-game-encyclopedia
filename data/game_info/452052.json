One day, the new guy Kyle decided to create a new shape, something with 100 sides... but it went horribly wrong! It wasn't a polygon, but something entirely different! It had to be destroyed immediately, but it escaped, leaving Polygonia Incorporated destroyed, along with anything else that got in its way... This new monstrous shape mutated and duplicated itself until it was too much to contain. These new shapes had one known weakness: LED lights, easily found in a flashlight. This is Kyle's story, and his redemption. He is Polygonia's Last Hero, and this is his story to restore light and hope\u00a0back to Polygonia! <br/><br/></p><p>Made with Unity3D.</p><p>\u00a0Please provide feedback, and let me know if you run into any bugs or issues. <br/></p><p>This is still in development and is not finished, however, the game's major story and gameplay is done. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T03:52:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba5119d97e8c2a9cbf4f68d6e5d9a988.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mars On Fire"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
