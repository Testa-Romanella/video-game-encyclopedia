All assets and code were created within a 1 week period.<br/><br/>It's a simple infinite runner action game where you fight slimes, fireballs, and skeleton people while collecting coins and making sure the ground doesn't fall out beneath your feet.\u00a0<br/>The controls are WASD to move, left click to shoot and right click to slash. I'm sure there are bugs so let me know in the comments, or suggest features/tell me your opinions etc<br/><br/>And if you enjoyed it you can donate to my patreon for more games like this:<br/>https://www.patreon.com/typotromic<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e21/e2168a2f51fdcf035f27fe4aba25453f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["typotromic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
