{"id": 522974, "slug": "haydee-2", "name": "Haydee 2", "name_original": "Haydee 2", "description": "<p>Haydee II, like its predecessor, is a game about a female protagonist locked in a strange complex with no clue of what\u2019s going on or how to get out. It is another maze of 6 themed sections and 160 rooms filled with enemies, puzzles and hidden items, where your only friends are your gun, your wits and item management. It is you against the challenge. You either give up or accept it. The choice is yours.<br />\nThis game will not give you:<br />\nAny clue or direction from the narrator<br />\nInteractive maps<br />\nAutosaves or checkpoints<br />\nHealth regeneration<br />\nObjective markers<br />\nEnough ammo or health kits<br />\nEnough inventory space<br />\nMercy</p>\n<p>But it will give you mods and an editor. Good luck with your journey!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-08T12:50:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc7/fc7c4e4d1f3658429d85dda32e773675.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 31, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Haydee Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Haydee Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
