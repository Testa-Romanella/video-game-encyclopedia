Blobbies like to deliver to the place closest to them, depending on what they\u2019re holding, so they\u2019ll need close supervision. Some buildings may need to be relocated to allow the\u00a0Blobbies to work effectively. Each successful delivery resets the clock and a new order comes in, but the delivery window decreases each time.\u00a0<strong>See how long you can keep up</strong>!</p>\n<p>If gameplay feels a little slow or fast, adjust the play speed to either get the Blobbies movin\u2019 faster, pause the clock, or to slow \u2018em down so nobody gets dizzy. Music volume can also be adjusted in the menu.</p>\n<p>For better performance, use a native build rather than the web version.
