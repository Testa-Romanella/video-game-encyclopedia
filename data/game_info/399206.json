Focused especially on the game juice.<br/></p>\n<p>An older project of mine, was originally going to be a full game. But after some time in development i kinda lost interest. <br/></p>\n\n<p>I decided to upload the project now, as i was really happy with the game-juice, sound design, AI and the technical architecture i had built. As i tried to resume development i found it really hard to read my code and rather decided to polish it a bit, and upload the game as a prototype. <br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Note: if anyone using GMS2 ever wanted to use the code for this project, just go ahead and DM me.\u00a0</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:51:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82f/82fb7514b1758240cb37e8d64a152c06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhilipL"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
