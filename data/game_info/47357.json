It\u2019s not quite a roguelike, but it is rogue-ish.<br/><br/>Taking equal inspiration from Pac-Man and Temple of Apshai, Dungeonism combines the strategies of turn-based RPGs and tile-based arcade games into a single unique gameplay style. It is engrossing enough to be played for hours, but its turn-based rhythm makes it easy to play in short bursts.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32d/32d5313309c9446d43e61e1a90d46248.jpg", "website": "http://dungeonism.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jeffrey Fal"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Jeffrey Fal"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
