To find the key to the door you must traverse through the mysterious paintings and solve the puzzles that emerges. The paintings will help you but also confuse and disorientate you.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project was to try and experience the concept of a Game Jam. The game was created in an emulated Game Jam by following the rules and conditions of Ludum Dare 37. We conducted this experiment off the regular schedule to better suit our calendar.</p>\n<p>Participants: Douglas Driving, Oscar Wirdelius<br/>Duration: 13/01-16/01 2019, 72 hours<br/>Theme: One Room</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:08:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29a/29aed161ac18fbdeea9a4cdab6e594b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Douglas Driving"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
