Roman gods, and modern planets. Within the depths of the Kuiper Belt, however, a timer has been ticking down, with a nearly-forgotten god watching it intently. Orcus, Roman god of death, has patiently waited millennia for the day that was foretold, when he would inherit all of existence.</p>\n<p><em>That day has now come.</em> With speed, firepower, and a guarding entourage of asteroids, Orcus sets out to slay the gods by his hand. However, being a small god with no worship nor mass, gravity is as much an obstacle as his opponents, with their orbits and moons jerking him around like a puppet on a string.<br/></p>\n<p>With enough determination, even the gods die. But to a god, death is not the end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T19:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30c/30cc8fe67f9bf7524eb9e9f623041fc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plasmaguy08"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
