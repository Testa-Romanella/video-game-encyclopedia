Inspired by the idea of daily exploration, Seven Doorways presents you with a different environment depending on which day of the week it is when you run it.</p><p>It's an exercise in slowing down and not worrying about goals or mechanics. There's nothing to do but hang out for a little while and enjoy your surroundings. Feel no pressure to stay, leave when you want and visit again another day for a new experience.<br/></p><p>This is more of a small prototype than a game (it was developed over roughly one week, as an entry to the Slow Game Jam), but it serves as a test for a larger game I plan on developing one day using this art style and mood.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Arrows or WASD - Move</p><p>Space - Use Staff</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/600/600728603cb103bfd09b9af8fc0c0874.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Graeme Borland"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
