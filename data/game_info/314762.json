Your boss has set you an ever increasing quota of souls to claim and your family\u2019s expenses threaten to ruin your finances. Can you keep your salary up and pay the bills?</p>\n<p>Featured: crazy physics and nightmarish landscapes.</p>\n<p>Claim souls that are RED. Claiming innocent souls causes a monetary penalty (-3). You have to meet your soul quota in your shift, which can range from 12 hours to 24 hours. At the end of each day you will receive money based on \u00a0your salary. If your money can\u2019t cover your bills or you don\u2019t meet your quota, the game ends.</p>\n<p>There is a day/night cycle that can make recognizing colors difficult. DAY = YELLOW, DAWN/DUSK = ORANGE, NIGHT = BLUE. The levels are randomly generated.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD - move, also french in Post-LD</p>\n<p>LEFT/RIGHT - turn</p>\n<p>SPACE - attack (claim soul)</p>\n<p>The game was programmed in Go using Vulkan (vulkan-go). GLFW is used for windowing. It uses my own engine, Gorium.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Roninkoi/LD44<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:30:33", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvNDE1MTU1LzIwNjMxODgucG5n/original/PumZ0t.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Roninkoi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
