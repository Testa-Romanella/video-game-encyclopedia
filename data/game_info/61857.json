{"id": 61857, "slug": "sail-ships", "name": "Sail Ships", "name_original": "Sail Ships", "description": "This is a casual, 3D game with ship battles.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to reach the 12 levels of development (12 ship types). Advancing in development, ship types are getting bigger and stronger.<br/><br/>More and more silver is needed for development, which can be obtained in two ways:<br/>- defeating enemy ships<br/>- trading (you can buy and sell goods in different ports at different prices, you can get more silver from buying goods cheaply and selling it costly in another port)<br/><br/>There is a world map showing the ports (with prices), the position of some enemy ships, and the position of your own ship (with the points of the compass).<br/>You can use a compass and a world map to determine the way you reach the ports and the (displayed) enemy ships.<br/><br/>The 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, Q, W, E keys capture the view on the 12 (displayed) enemy ships. This helps for the ship battles.<br/><br/>The world map will only show you the position of your ship and your opponents, if it is prompted by pressing a key. You have a limited number of queries, which is reduced for each query, but you get new ones by defeating enemy ships. Worth to count this for good navigation.<br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/><ul><li>Ship battles<br/></li><li>Navigation with compass and world map<br/></li><li>Trading with different prices (buy cheaply, sell costly)<br/></li><li>12 ship types</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f2ce73f55a6147fe5ab7eb539657155.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dhause"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Dhause"], "esrb_rating": null}
