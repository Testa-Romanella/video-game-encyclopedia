You are a pilot of a space battle capsule and your goal is to navigate underground caves and eliminate all alien bases.<br/><br/>Your ship has rocket engines for horizontal movements and for going up. Acceleration, intertia and gravity are dutifully simulated. There is no \"down\" control - if you need to go down, you have to let the ship fall. Activating motors requires fuel. Running out of fuel means death.<br/><br/>Underground caves are full of aliens and enemy machinery trying to block your progress and defend the bases. However, your spaceship has lethal firepower - plasma cannon, bombs and missiles will easily anihilate any opposition - IF you master how to use them.<br/><br/><strong>WARNING:</strong> This is old-school game with old-school difficulty. Do not even try unless you are ready to die a lot.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/4306d768e9e7f54a5ecd4668516f7525.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miroslav F\u00eddler"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CYBEXLAB"], "esrb_rating": null}
