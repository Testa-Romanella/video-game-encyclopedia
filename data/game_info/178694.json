This game was made for a school project so it is not a high quality game.</p>\n<p>The game is a 2D platformer and it excists of 1 level (maybe more to be added later). The game is still in Alpha so there are probably bugs in there. If you find any bugs please leave a comment with what the bug is and where in the level you found it.</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE:</p>\n<p>This whole game is still being developed, so sprites and levels may change. And there is currently no menu, so to close the game you must use alt+f4 or you need to use the taskmanager.</p>\n<p>Alpha V0.0.1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a56/a56ecf361751bbe8b04150e614fe6dc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dank Games", "Ricknl"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
