They narrate the events that both preceed and follow the arrival of Jamie, a sixteen year old boy who one night is transported to Aliorbis, a mysterious alternative version of Earth where magic and science coexist with (almost) peace, and which is controlled by a god-like being called the Holy Entity.</p>\n<p>There, Jamie discovers he is what many in Aliorbis call a \"Visitor\", a special kind of person who has the capacity to cross the barrier that separates both versions of Earth. Because of this, he soon gets recruited by SEEK, an organisation that investigates crimes that suppose a threat to both worlds.</p>\n<p>However, what at first seems as an idyllic and magical world, \u201clike one you\u00b4d find in a book or a videogame\u201d, as Jamie puts it, soon starts to show signs of a dark and twisted past filled with dread, corruption and chaos. A past that everyone in SEEK wants to remain hidden, but that threatens to come back to take revenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Check the project\u00b4s official kickstarter page!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T02:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/6020b09fb2780d86f8224c398321b659.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Miguel H.
