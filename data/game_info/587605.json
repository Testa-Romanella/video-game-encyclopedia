But how RISKY can you get avoiding those bullets? <br/></p>\n<p>The rules are simple! Dodge the grey bullets being as risky as you can to fill the bar. When the bar is filled, start eating bullets to make the cube bigger! The game will end when you grow enough! Good Luck! <br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy this little game made entirely with cubes!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>WASD/Arrow Keys to move the cube!<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n Credits \r\nMusic\r\n<ul>\n<li>Joshua McLean -  \r\nhttp://mrjoshuamclean.com/</li>\n</ul>\r\nSounds\r\n<ul><li>Free SFX - https://www.freesfx.co.uk</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T10:13:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7eb/7eb0ffd3e9509a9cc26a97758401e491.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Antonio Espinosa Barrios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
