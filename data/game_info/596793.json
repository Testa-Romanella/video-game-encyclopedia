Will you sacrifice the most suns and become the next sun god?</p>\n\n<p>Move your pieces to the other side of the board and sacrifice suns to score the most points.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>A piece consists of three layers. Every time a piece gets hits by the opponent, it will lose a layer.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Pieces with three layers are called sun carriers.\u00a0The top layer is called the sun.\u00a0 When a piece with three layers reaches the other side of the board, it can score a point.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Pieces with two layers left are called carriers. Suns can be transferred to them, this causes them to transform into sun carriers.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Pieces with just one layer remaining are called guards. They can no longer carry suns, so their main purpose it to prevent other pieces from advancing along the board.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>When a player takes his turn, he can choose one of four actions. In the top right corner there is a move toggle. It is on piece mode by default. When it is on piece mode, the following actions can be performed:\r\n  </p>\n<p>A player can left click on a piece to select it. Then he can move it to a adjacent horizontal or vertical space by clicking on that space, if it is empty.\u00a0 By clicking on the current space, the move is canceled.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When his piece is next to a piece from his opponent, he can also choose to hit it. When a piece hits another, it jumps over it. Hitting a piece removes a layer from it.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Clicking on the sun symbol at the top right corner, sets the move toggle to sun mode. When it is on sun mode, the following actions can be performed:\r\n  </p>\n<p>When a sun carrier has reached the other side of the board, it can sacrifice its sun. By clicking\u00a0on a piece, the sun\u00a0becomes selected and it can be moved\u00a0to a character (the character starts waving at the player, when a sacrifice can be made). Sacrificing a sun removes it from play, in return the player gets a point.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Suns can also be transferred between two pieces. By clicking\u00a0on a sun carrier that is adjacent to one of the players carriers, the sun becomes selected.\u00a0Then by clicking on one of the players\u00a0carriers, the sun will be transferred. Suns can be stolen from the opponent, if the player has a carrier next to a sun carrier of the opponent. \r\n  </p>\n<p>The sun carrier that loses his sun due to a transfer, is locked in place. It cannot be interacted with until the owner has taken another turn.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>The game ends when all the suns are removed from the game. The player with the most points wins the game. When both players have an equal amount or no points, the winner gets decided based on the amount of layers a player has remaining on his pieces. When this amount is also the same, the game results in a draw.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T19:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/511/511f68ac3e6fe0279df489ba1bf69971.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MasterMoni"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
