{"id": 353184, "slug": "bird-brains", "name": "Bird Brains", "name_original": "Bird Brains", "description": "Bird Brains is a 3D cooperative puzzle game that forces players to think outside the nest.\r\n<p>Take control of two blocky characters with snazzy headgear to deliver the egg to the nest at the end of each level. One can squash, one can stretch, and both must work together to solve puzzles. Grab a friend and buckle up for a roller coaster of gut-busting laughter, head-scratching puzzles, and triumphant successes.</p>\n<p><strong>Requires two Playstation 4 controllers to play.</strong></p><p>Bird Brains was made from scratch over the course of about 3 months for my capstone project at the NYU Game Center. Everything in the game was independently developed by yours truly with the exception of the skybox and some of the sound effects. It was displayed at the 2019 Student Showcase with positive reception.
