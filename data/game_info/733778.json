You must collect items and feed them to the Goblet to gain more power. It was made almost entirely by me, but the boss sprite was made by YouKnowWho6039, and the fade out transition is by travesol_dog.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-You cannot open chests until you complete the first dungeon. Once you get the Open Chest Rune, it's a good idea to run the first dungeon again to get some items for power. By the way, 8 items in the Goblet = +1 Damage</p>\n<p>-Some weapons have a type. They are:</p>\n<p>-Fire: +1 damage</p>\n<p>-Earth: Greater Range</p>\n<p>-Air: Greater Knockback</p><p>-The weapons do different damage:</p><p>-Staff: 1 damage</p><p>-Sword: 2 damage</p><p>-Spear: 3 damage</p><p>-Rod: 4 damage</p>\n<p>-The combat system is a bit weird: the recharge time is pretty long. Wait until your enemy is close to strike, then run from other enemies. Strike when you see your held item above your head. The recharge number by your item is a bit wonky for now, when it\u2019s 6-7 it\u2019s dealing damage, when it\u2019s 5-4 it\u2019s recharging, and lower than that, you can strike again.</p>\n<p>-I've done my best with bugfixing, but there are likely a few lingering bugs. Report any you find down below please!</p>\n<p>-Speaking of...</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs/Things That Will Be Changed Soon</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Enemies can get knocked back into walls.</p>\n<p>-The weapon icon appears above your head before the recharge is up.</p>\n<p>-No music/SFX :(</p>\n<p>Check back later for updates!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/271/271d8a2c52271278e37b6f7811d2f456.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["00Her0"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
