The theme was roots!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game</strong></p>\n<p>\"Colorful Roots\" is a fun and challenging puzzle game that combines math and color. The goal is to match the target by combining or taking roots of the given numbers. But be warned, taking roots not only affects the number, but also the color. And when combining numbers, the colors mix just like in real life! It's important to think ahead and understand the order of operations.</p>\n<p>The game utilizes Mixbox technology to accurately mix colors, overcoming the common problem of blue and yellow not producing green in many other apps. Because the game is on webgl we chose old flash game ui style and we believe it fits the game better than expected, providing a visually appealing and unique puzzle experience.</p>\n<p>To play, simply drag one number onto another or onto the root symbol to obtain the correct components. When you believe you have the right answer, drag it into the box next to the goal to complete the level.</p>\n<p><strong>We hope you will have fun!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<p>Programming -\u00a0Melis Kaya</p>\n<p>Game Design -\u00a0Murad Aliustaoglu</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>\n<p>Mixbox (Color mixing) - https://scrtwpns.com/mixbox/</p>\n<p>Fonts by Dafont</p>\n<p>Sound Effects by x Nicole Marie T (OpenGameArt)</p>\n<p>Background music by Zander Noriega\u00a0(OpenGameArt)</p>\n<p>Icons by Icons8</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T17:12:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/057/057fa34a05d1c5a6b08e4d6c5435aa24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["titansboost"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
