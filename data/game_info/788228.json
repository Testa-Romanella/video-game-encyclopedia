You may need about 30-60 minutes to read through it. The game was made in about 20+ hours of development time, so it may still feel unpolished. Improvements may be made to the game later in June.</p>\n<p>This story serves as a prelude to my upcoming massive trip that will stretch across three months from late May to late August 2022. It goes through my plans from start to finish and features whatever crazy ideas were swirling around my mind throughout the process.</p>\n<p>Potentially dozens of stories will be written throughout my journey and each one will one day be converted into a visual novel. If this idea interests you in any way, do keep an eye out for developments and stay tuned for further releases that will likely happen later in September or October. You are also very welcome to donate money to show your support and encourage me to write plenty of stories :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T13:40:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/53244c3fb083e155bc8a258e71c75018.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JGBBG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
