Initially, I'd made a robust ramp and roll game. It worked, sure, but it was pretty boring if I'm honest. I'd seen it\u00a0 before. So with limited time left on the project, I decided to get weird. Inspired by my love of Jurassic Park, I set out to make the most Jeff Goldblum game ever. I think I succeeded. Albeit, it's also one of the worst games ever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:01:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/052301b0be312f746e1f8cef92ef0bc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Joe George"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
