Having been bullied in the past, she\u2019s unwilling to socialize in this new environment. But at each turn, Suki finds herself drawn further and further by certain personalities \u2013 like her old childhood friend who seems keen on speaking to her, a particularly stoic member of the occult club, or a rough n\u2019 tough delinquent who\u2019s more than meets the eye. Who are these people? What makes them so different? What makes Suki different? And who is that lurking in the shadows that seems to be following around wherever Suki goes? It could all be her imagination, but whatever happens, Suki\u2019s in for a wild ride at Yanagi High School.</p>\n<p>WARNING: foul language, violence, and explicit themes and topics such as torture, suicide, depression, and abuse.<br/></p>\n<p>-THIS GAME IS AN EARLY ACCESS FOR THE HORROR GAME JAM AND NOT THE FULL/FINAL VERSION-</p>\n<p>What is missing from the early access build:<br/></p>\n<p>-Polyamorous routes/paths/storylines</p>\n<p>-\"happy\"/lover endings</p>\n<p>-final voice acting</p>\n<p>The full version will come no later than the end of 2018.</p>\n\n<p>{NOTES: I wrote, drew, edited, and coded everything with the help of Ren'Py.
