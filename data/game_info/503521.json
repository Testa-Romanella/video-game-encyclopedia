Fight!\r\n<p>As a recently dead android, you've now arrived in the Android Afterlife. This means you now have to battle all the other androids you've killed in your life. But you're not alone! Along to help you is... you? As time is pretty <em>wonky </em>in the Android Afterlife, you actually have three separate save files you can use to battle in the same time! (kind of)</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Choose three abilities for each save, and then fight through various levels, one save at a time. Your past saves will repeat their actions to help you! You can also interact with the past (well, technically, the 'now'). If you died in another save, but save it this time, you can go back to that save to finish it!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use WASD to move and LMB, RMB and E to fire your abilities.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>rubr (@TheRubr) - programming, art</li><li>ovrbi (@ISmotrovs) - programming, art</li><li>Lewmoth (@Lewmothmusic) - sounds, music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:58:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6f/b6fa1a94f4658a61dfd055d80d6b7815.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rubr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
