This is our first test demo for Mediquest, a game that we all envisioned together.</p>\n<p>By hearing the stories of different patients, you will perform diagnoses and hopefully learn a thing or two, both medically and about the personal struggles of people's lives. We hope you enjoy testing out this demo, as short as it is!</p>\n<p>Thank you :)</p>\n<p><strong>Follow our development on Twitter @codebluestudios</strong></p>\n<p><em>We do not claim to be medical professionals, but we consult med students as well as residents\u00a0so as to be responsible and avoid spreading misinformation. For the purpose of gamification and pacing, the diagnosis tree has been simplified.\u00a0All assets, including art and sound, have been made by our team - with the exception of a few that are 100% royalty-free.\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T10:13:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f7/8f785c1efef65a6576f4afe8e844fd10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Code Blue Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
