Probably not... but lets laugh at the dumb AI raging of the broken menu, when you Play The Game!</p>\n\n\n<p>Play The Game is a platformer game where a giant claw eats strawberries whilst chasing you, the robot... well, it would be if somebody would fix the damn menu screen!</p>\n\n<p>(This game is satire - there is hardly any platforming but the elements of the game are not listed to the give the Player a first look experience with no idea of what will happen. Please keep this in mind if you're planning to make media such as Let's Play videos or reviews.
