{"id": 104935, "slug": "shark-swimulator", "name": "Shark Swimulator", "name_original": "Shark Swimulator", "description": "<p>Shark Swimulator is a game about a shark who needs to \"rescue\" a diver from his underwater prison. Are you a shark enough dude to save him?! <br/><br/>Shark Swimulator was created using the *awesome* L\u00d6VE game framework. We used a preview build of L\u00d6VE 0.10.0 and that is required to run the source. The Windows build is pre-built so it should run fine on any hardware that supports OpenGL 2.1. <br/><br/>Shark Swimulator is translated in English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Russian and a bonus language. The game is also fully voiced in English, German, and the bonus language. <br/><br/>Hotkeys: <br/>F9: Change the language <br/>Pause: Mute audio <br/>Alt+Enter: Full screen <br/><br/>Controls: <br/>WS/ud: swim around <br/>QE: Zoom camera <br/>Mouse: Rotate camera <br/><br/>This game has gamepad support and should work with any Xbox 360 or compatible controller. If your controller doesn't work, try launching the game from Steam. <br/><br/>Basic Mechanics: <br/>Slam your sexy shark face into the rope or cage to save the diver from his bonds. <br/><br/>Additional Information: <br/>If you get a crash or the game won't run, you can grab a crash.log file from %APPDATA% (or your OS's equivalent). Please send us the crash log and your system specs in one of the methods listed at the top of the crash.log file. <br/><br/>Thank you for playing our game! &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a61/a61fbf9f76b7fde73099017bcc43bb24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["holo", "Karai17"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
