The game is still in development, and bugs may yet exist, and crashes may occur.</p>\n<p>Check the attached game manual for lots more detail about the game.</p>\n\n<p>It would be really nice to hear any feedback from anyone that plays!\u00a0If you like it or think it sucks\u00a0please, please get in touch!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a2/3a22bb2800e046aa3193221b812471f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["mindrelay"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
