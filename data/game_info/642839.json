I am also an accordionist.</p>\n<p>I did this small game and i would really appreciate any kind of feedback as it is my first time creating and posting anything. Any kind of constructive comment is appreciated.</p>\n<p>I had no experience making games, i only knew programing and not related to game dev. I did almost every asset of the game (although with a lot of reference) so please understand that it looks so ugly because i lack experience.</p>\n<p>Also i am not comfortable with the name so any suggestion is also welcome</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T09:10:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdc/fdc95cb97cfec18321782e8f4734ffab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["campodetenis"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
