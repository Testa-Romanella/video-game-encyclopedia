Combat inspired by the Megaman: Battle Network combat (which is realtime).</p>\n<p>The game works as a series of small-scale tactical battles where you have to use elemental \"ammo\" to cast spells; the campaign is a series of choices between easier/harder battles, which will grant you different \"ammo\" for future battles. It is basically a very condensed minimal version of a roguelike dungeon dive.</p>\n<p>Developed in 7 days for 7DRL 2023.</p><p>Gameplay help:</p><ul><li>The four elements that serve as \"ammo\" have different effects on your attack:<ul><li>Fire is your basic attack, each point will increase the attack length by 1</li><li>Shock is a longer attack, each point will increase the attack length by 2</li><li>Earth will act as a basic attack, but having at least one point in your attack will place an obstacle wherever your projectile stops; an attack with just one Earth is a good way to put a barrier in front of you to tank one attack</li><li>Air acts as an enhancement to your attack, having at least one point will cause your attack to hit only the final spot in your attack, immediately on the following turn, also skipping over any obstacles</li></ul></li><li>Elements recover after a few turns, but during that time you can't attack or defend except by moving</li><li>Obstacles can be destroyed by hitting them with any attack, however you can only attack forwards so make sure you don't let yourself get surrounded</li><li>Enemies attack with the same elements you do, look at the projectile path and particles to figure out what the attack is going to be</li></ul>\n\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>Enemies can sometimes navigate into a corner and become \"off-screen\" (their attacks seem to wrap around and start from the other end of the screen) - they will eventually move back onto the map if you keep waiting</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b37/b3706a51d17b9b05b0f768e854a17270.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mikeredhorse"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
