With the myriad Galaxies, including our Milky Way galaxy, containing billions of Stars, and our own Solar System? See the Earth from above, including the International Space Station and an Astronaut in orbit. What does his Brain look like? What about its Neural Network, all the Neuron Cells and their DNA? Have you seen an Electron Cloud surrounding the tiny Atomic Nucleus, filled with Protons and Neutrons? And what lies at even smaller scales?Educational <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> experience<br/><br/>Welcome to the Orders of Magnitude project. An educational <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> experience which will show you our Universe at many different scales. You can zoom in or out along one linear path to see all the known physical sizes that exist.<h3>Based on real science</h3><br/><br/>Most of the content is taken from various scientific databases and is striving to represent elements as they exist in their nature.<br/><br/>Sometimes it is hard to visualize how things look like in reality, so a bit of artistic approach was needed. Nobody has pictured the whole Observable Universe, and nobody has seen a single Electron and its color (as it has no color).<br/><br/>Example of some of the databases used in this project:<br/><br/><ul><li>Position of nearby <strong>40 000 Galaxies</strong> \u2013 2MASS Redshift Survey<br/></li><li>Position of nearby <strong>100 000 Stars</strong> \u2013 Hipparcos catalogue<br/></li><li><strong>Brain</strong> connections \u2013 Human Connectome project<br/></li><li>Hippocampus <strong>Neural Network</strong> \u2013 Clarity project<br/></li><li><strong>DNA</strong> atom positions \u2013 Protein Data Bank</li></ul><h3>Non-VR supported!</h3><br/><br/>A non-VR version has been released. However, the main focus of this app is VR, so the non-VR version is not polished, but it is fully functional. You will not get the same experience as in VR, where the Universe is all around you :)<h3>Keyboard And Mouse Controls</h3><br/><strong>Z</strong> - Zoom In<br/><strong>X</strong> - Zoom Out<br/><strong>Left Shift</strong> - Fast Zoom<br/><strong>Space</strong> - Highlight Objects<br/><br/><strong>Mouse Wheel</strong> - Zoom<br/><strong>Left Mouse Button Drag</strong> - Rotate<br/><strong>Left Mouse Button Click</strong> - Select Object", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T22:45:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/546/546798040fad8c6b6e63aee44207c5a4.jpg", "website": "https://ordersofmagnitudevr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ouroboro Soft"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ouroboro Soft"], "esrb_rating": null}
