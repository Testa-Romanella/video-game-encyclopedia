This natural approach to language acquisition is called\u00a0Task Based Language Teaching\u00a0(TBLT) and it's the foundation of Sheng Tian (<strong>\u5347\u5929</strong>).\u00a0</p>\n<p>No matter your native language, you\u00a0can play<strong>\u00a0Sheng Tian (\u5347\u5929)\u00a0</strong>and learn Chinese Mandarin terms. There's no English* in the game. Instead of translating terms to your native language, you'll discover and use the meaning of the Chinese terms directly with their intended meaning\u00a0in context.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>* There are a few English terms in the Settings page.\u00a0</p>\r\nChinese Language Settings\r\n<p><strong>Traditional\u00a0 vs. Simplified</strong>.\u00a0You can switch between traditional characters (normally seen in\u00a0Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) and simplified characters (seen in Mainland China, Singapore, Malaysia).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Native pronunciation. </strong>All pronunciations are Chinese Mandarin recorded by native speakers.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Subtitles. </strong>To aid in pronouncing Chinese terms, you can have subtitles displayed using two different romanization options\u00a0(a\u00a0way of writing Mandarin Chinese pronunciation with letters). Pinyin is the main romanization method used in Mainland China. Also, Yale romanization is included because the spelling is intuitive for new learners. To reduce distraction, subtitles are disabled by default, but you can enable them if you like.\u00a0</p>\n<p>MINIMUM RECOMMENDED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS**<br/></p>\n<p><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10 (64-bit versions only)<br/><strong>Processor</strong>: 3.2 Ghz Dual Core Processor (or better).\u00a0SSE2 instruction set support.<br/><strong>Memory</strong>: 6 GB RAM (or more).\u00a0<br/><strong>Graphics Card</strong>: 2 GB Dedicated Video Card (or better).\u00a0\u00a0DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.<br/><strong>Storage</strong>: 3 GB\u00a0available space (or more)</p>\n<p>**The game may play (by lowering the settings)\u00a0on systems with lower specifications, but the above is the minimum hardware specs recommended by Unity for the High Definition Rendering Pipeline and based on the machine\u00a0that we test on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T08:12:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d92a0b8adea319d48a7674b40fb66d98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["East Bay Immersive Games"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
