YES, THOSE ARE STAIRS. IT'S A BAD DRAWING. APOLOGIES IF YOU GOT STUCK AT THE FIRST GHOST. <br/></p>\n<p>Rude Bear RPG is the origin story of the Rude Bear franchise, and the seventh game in the series. <br/></p>\n<p>The prequel to the smash fail Rude Bear Rising, and Preprequel to the original Rude Bear. <br/></p>\n<p>It uses a realtime battle system and links the worlds of Earthbound, Pokemon Red/Blue, Pokemon Gold/Silver, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Super Mario RPG as well as connecting different worlds (volcano, desert, forest, tower, grave). <br/></p>\n<p>For anyone familiar with the Rude Bear saga, it also lays the foundation of connecting Rude Bear Resurrection to Rude Bear Rising, as well as bringing back the puppet style of the original Rude Bear. <br/></p>\n<p>It controls entirely with the mouse. e.g. click Defend just as you're about to get hit by a powerful attack to potentially take 0 damage if you time it right. <br/>I also ran the optional theme \"Marilyn Manson\" with a few others. <br/></p>\n<p>SPELL LIST: <br/></p>\n<p>Rude Bear: <br/>Bullet Time (2 $C): Slows down the game time so defense is easier. <br/>Galvanise (4 $C): Gives 4$C to the chosen ally. <br/>White Lightning (6 $C): Strong magic attack, targets 1 enemy. <br/>Rain Dance (8 $C): Magic attack, targets all enemies. <br/>Martyvate (10 $C): Sacrifices Rude Bear to fully swag out Rad Boar and Robed Bird. <br/></p>\n<p>Rad Boar: <br/>Seismic Chop (2 $C): Strong physical attack. <br/>Attention Hog (4 $C): Sticks a Kick Me sign to one ally. This ally will then take all enemy attacks. Using it twice on the same character removes it. <br/>Boarrier (6 $C): Grants a shield to one ally, which doubles their defense until it wears off. <br/>Hamdemic (8 $C): Sends out Swine Flu and damages all enemies with magic. <br/>Sepporku (10 $C): Sacrifices Rad Boar to give super shields to both allies. These shields last significantly longer. <br/></p>\n<p>Robed Bird: <br/>Dark Chant (2 $C): Heals all allies. <br/>Storm Patrol (4 $C): Harms all enemies with a magic attack. <br/>Phoenix Up (6 $C): Revives one ally and/or heals all their HP. <br/>Scythe Bill (8 $C): A barrage of 8 consecutive physical attacks, does a lot of damage. <br/>Bleeding Heart (10 $C): Sacrifices Robed Bird to max revive both other party members.
