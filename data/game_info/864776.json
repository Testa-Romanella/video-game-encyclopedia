Interviews can be 20 mins or 2 hours,\u00a0in person, online or over text \u2013 up to you and the interviewees to\u00a0arrange. During the interviews you ask lots of questions, leading\u00a0questions if you like, write down the answers and build a case to\u00a0solve the mystery.</p>\n<p>That is why this is a semi-solo game. You will generate most of the\u00a0mystery, you will journal and log your findings, draw conclusions\u00a0and decide what leads to pursue. You will take all that information\u00a0and use it to interview suspects, witnesses, experts and similar. Ask\u00a0people to play these characters, ask them leading question and use\u00a0their answers to build and solve the mystery.</p>\n<p>You will need a d6, a means of taking notes and an insatiable\u00a0curiosity!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T11:14:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d3/3d389229d549ddbe8e1222448870ab07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black Armada Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
