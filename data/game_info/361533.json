Go through wave after wave of enemy with your only weapon and see how long you can survive.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>It is a basic top-down shooter, you move with your keyboard and point and shoot with your mouse.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The subtility is that you have to take the time to pick up your harpoon every time you shoot it. So you better be careful before using it or be ready to run.</p>\n<p>Also, be aware that some enemies are particularly good at avoiding your harpoon and defeating them will need some timing.</p>\r\nTechnical Issue\r\n<p>There is some trouble with the camera on the WebGL version of the game. In consequence\u00a0the game is only available on windows right now.\u00a0 Sorry :'-(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T23:04:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0f3d2e88fdbbc559e4657d82d21fdde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheBigRoomXXL"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
