Once they turn big and opaque you, can combine them and form a storm cloud. Be careful where you form the storm clouds, because you can't blow them away.\u00a0<br/>After watering the forests, you need to blow the cloud away to let the forest regenerate with the help of a little sunlight and be ready to grow your next cloud.<br/>If there are farms near by, make sure to water them from time to time, because if the crop dries out, the farmers will abandon it and cut down the nearest forest to make a new farm.<br/>Avoid the nasty cities at all cost!<br/><br/>Download, run the CloudGame.exe<br/>Controls:\u00a0 walk with the WASD keys, hold down the SHIFT key to sprint,\u00a0 hold down the left mouse key to charge up your blow<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d82/d82cc01fab1816c72d74fff279d545ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fisher007"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
