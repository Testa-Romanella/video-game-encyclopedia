You know, that of a young successful businessman. But let's not rush things. <br/>You were born and raised in a big city, in a reasonably well-off family, and you've never needed anything. Still, despite all of that, you didn't become a spoiled brat and devoted your entire life to studying... Studying how to drink without getting drunk, how to throw great parties, and enjoy all the other pleasures of a rich life. <br/><br/>Well, you know... your youth... It was perfect!<br/><br/>However, that kind of life quickly gets boring. All the partying, the drinking, the girls... At some point, it all starts to seem colorless and empty... <br/>Unfortunately, that's what happened to my family. One day, they decided to take matters into their own hands, and that is how I ended up \"volunteering\" to learn how to run a family business. And then...<br/><br/><br/><br/>One spark, and you're inside the storm of madness! As fate would have it, you're already the owner of a small hotel in the middle of a beach-side town. A small, but insanely ambitious hotel. Fitting for someone as ambitious as yourself. <br/><br/>Just think about it...<br/>Tourists burst through the hotel doors. Girls stick to you in droves. Mad cash flowing into your hands... Now stop imagining and snap back to reality, because all of that is just your assumptions about the future.<br/><br/>For now, all you have is just a normal hotel. Inside a dull, boring town. With a bunch of hotties, some of them even in your employment.<br/>It would be cool if your family, surprised by such quick progress and convinced of your talent, let you be free... But... This is your family business and this is just the beginning of your journey...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Can you regain the trust of your family, while becoming an authority for your employees and a chick magnet outside of work?<br/>It's all up to you.<h3>Early Access</h3>This game is in Early Access.<br/><br/>Regular free updates will be provided to anyone who has already purchased the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T03:19:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/459dbc36f3c2b96d9259ca3266f0f5f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 444, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["L7team"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["L7team"], "esrb_rating": null}
