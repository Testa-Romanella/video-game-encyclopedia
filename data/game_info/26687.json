Take control of a cursed man and race upwards, higher and \n      higher inside a tower, in a desperate race to break the curse. You'll \n      need to overcome hordes of ghastly creatures and demons that lay in wait \n      obscuring the twisting path to the top. Run, jump and fly your way to \n      the top, with time always against you. There are 40 eerie levels with 10 \n      types of gothic-style graphics, not for the easily scared or \n      faint-hearted.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9df403c66b89648d6147c0664620b12b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Gamebridge"], "esrb_rating": null}
