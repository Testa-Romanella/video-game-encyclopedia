You can enjoy it alone, without teammates, while you have to kill hordes of enemies to survive. For this survival game, you need gaming skills, courage, a good dose of patience, and a fancy to kill enemies to overcome even the most difficult challenges. In return, you will get a large map with 5 areas, game experience, surprising moments, different types of weapons, multiple types of characters, and various types of unique enemies.<br/><br/><strong>Would you dare to play this game? Can you survive? Can you kill as many enemies as possible and achieve the highest score?</strong><br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br/><br/><strong>MAP</strong> \u2013 The game map is divided into 5 areas, each area representing a different part of the city. We made it a point to make every area look as realistic as possible.<br/><br/><strong>CHARACTERS</strong> - We offer a choice of several types of characters. Choose to play as a female character or beat your enemies as a male character.<br/><br/><strong>WEAPONS</strong> - The choice of weapon is up to you. You have a large variety of weapons to choose from. In addition to weapons, you can also use brute force and punch enemies, but not all of them!<br/><br/><strong>ENEMIES</strong> - You are being chased by \"ordinary\" enemies, but also by enemies with special characteristics, which can be a challenge for someone and which you have to deal with.<br/><br/><strong>DIFFICULTY</strong> - You have several difficulty levels to choose from. They will test your gaming skills from a third-person perspective. The higher the level, the higher the number of enemies.  And the enemies are getting stronger and more aggressive.<br/><br/><strong>ACID STORM</strong> - A forgotten experiment supposed to help civilization stop spreading a contagion around the world got out of control. Now you have to avoid the consequences of this experiment and stay alive until the experiment ends.<br/><br/><strong>ENRAGE</strong> - The longer you fight the enemies, the more they adapt to you and become more resistant and aggressive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T06:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc4e4361baf7f47d68b65c69dd71b0f3.jpg", "website": "https://www.carpediemproject.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 507, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Papagaye"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Papagaye"], "esrb_rating": null}
