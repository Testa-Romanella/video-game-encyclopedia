Experience the legacy of Infinite's brother in this 2D Side Scrolling Sonic Game! The sequel to Sonic Forces! NOTE: (I don't own any of the music, characters, backgrounds, nor Sonic the Hedgehog himself. This is just a Fan Game.) The game will receive updates on the Extras menu, but for now. Enjoy the story! (Press F2 to restart the application to the beginning. Doesn't delete save though.) Sometimes when a level starts, the Goal Ring sound effect will play, just press the R key to restart the stage, and it will go away. Hold the jump button while on springs to go higher.\u00a0 (Update ver. 1.05 - HUD is changed, multiple\u00a0glitches are fixed, Boost gauge is increased, Jump dashes no longer contain Boost energy, controls are fixed, levels are fixed more, game is more fair,\u00a0the game is less buggy.)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/960/96000e919f81b580a27fbc0a0ad2183b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DeliriousNova"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
