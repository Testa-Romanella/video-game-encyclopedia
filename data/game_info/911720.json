This game was made for <strong>Clicker Jam Winter 2023</strong>. You are a traveler whose spaceship has been sucked into a black hole and to get out of it you need to accelerate the ship to light speed (300,000 km/s). This is very difficult task, so you need to assemble a team of aliens, that will\u00a0help you upgrade your ship. Also try to do it as fast as possible and get into the high score table.
