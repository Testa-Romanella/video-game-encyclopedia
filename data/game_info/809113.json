Then find the portal and enter it. Then the game will stop, and you've won.\u00a0To buy items from the shop, just\u00a0keep shooting at them, and make sure you have enough coins. Also fullscreen is\u00a0<strong>highly</strong><em>\u00a0</em>recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>How does this fit the theme?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game fits the theme of \"Pick a Side\" because you have to choose which paths to follow, and each path is on the side of the screen. Yeah, kind of a stretch, but hey. I'm just proud I pulled this off :)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Cool Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Random generation</li><li>Pathfinding</li><li>Smoothness</li><li>8Bit SFX [From jsfxr]</li><li>Cool music [By Kevin MacLeod]</li><li>Rogueliteyness</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T06:32:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d4357f2088d58b202ff815a0dfa1d44e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spruce Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
