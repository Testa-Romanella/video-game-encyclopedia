Someday I may revisit this project and add powered doors, a proper win condition, box and player collision for stacking box puzzles\u00a0(yay!) and platforms that can be enabled when a button is pressed. There are also a couple issues with buttons in the future and edge collision detection for the player character that I may fix in the future too. I feel that this concept has a lot of potential, so I really want to continue working on it. This is also my first time making a serious game and drawing pixel art, but it overall was a fun experience!</p>\n<p>If it ever crashes, send the generated\u00a0traceback.txt file in the comments and I'll try fix the issue.<br/></p>\n<p>Source code is avaliable at:\u00a0https://github.com/Sebby37/boxin-thru-time-source/</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>The idea: Portal Reloaded, OneLoneCoder</li><li>My friend for telling me about the jam in the first place</li><li>The crane in the background of the present:\u00a0http://pixelartmaker.com/art/869cd5930589daa</li><li>The sound effects: rFXGen by Raylib Technologies</li><li>The rest of the pixel art and code: Myself \ud83d\ude0e</li><li>Code libraries and language: Python 3.8.1, Pygame 2.0.1</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:01:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd8/dd8bcdd91ad5bfe51001839b492e316e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seb C:"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
