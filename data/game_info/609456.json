Macandili</p>\n<p>Between the years 2030-2050, there will be an estimated 250,000 people dying each year\u00a0because of climate change. Some experts have stressed that this is a conservative estimate, and that the deaths are already occurring today. So who should be held accountable for the hundred thousands of lives lost? Rear Windows is a (mass) murder mystery game where you can have a stab at this question. Play and attempt to find the culprit of this heinous crime.<br/></p>\n<p>The game shows that the epoch of Anthropocene cannot be paused simply by reducing mobility such as the effect of COVID-19 restrictions. The logic of capitalism and class divisions\u00a0in our society is at the root of the climate crisis which cannot be done away without radical action.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:13:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af7/af7106dd1279d36e1fcae9f21c428fd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["juliens-binalot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
