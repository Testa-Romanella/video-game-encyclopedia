Just push play and let it do its thing because half of the time it will do what it wants rather than what you tell it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to come join on Tiktok: williamalexandercraig</p>\n<p>This game is in development, this is a preview of the current development of the game and will be updated as i add more suggestions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T20:00:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/715/7151709096dd6574a24baa6361948624.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["William Alexander Craig"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
