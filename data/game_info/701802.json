I\u00a0have a whole story planned in this world,\u00a0and this is just a single part\u00a0of a bigger journey.</p>\n<p>All artwork is placeholder artwork, nothing is final, little sound is available and the game is very protytpe.

Short, strong and hates magic.</p>\n<p>Joined by him is the lovely Higganon, Tall, smart, just want to get business done, and is (un)fortunately studying under Barnon to become an archeologist herself. In fact Barnon is the only archeologist who would take Higganon in.</p>\n<p>Together, they wants to uncover secrets of our world, find out what there is, and why theres a giant towering mountain in their land! What secrets will they find together? Will there be loot? Probably lots of it I\u00a0mean Barnon really loves loot!\u00a0It's like it's the source to all of his power!<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls (Xbox One controller)</p>\n<p>Left Analog/DPad - Movement</p>\n<p>A - Jump</p>\n<p>A (while in mid air) - Glide</p>\n<p>X -\u00a0Punch<br/></p>\n<p>LB - Fire Projectile</p>\n<p>Right Analog - Aim in direction</p>\n<p>While aiming, press LB to fire in that direction</p>\n<p>RB\u00a0- Dash</p>\n<p>RB + Down -\u00a0Dash downwards (can be used to destroy blocks below and knock enemies away)</p>\n<p>B - Grab and move blocks</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Picking up gold increases your total strength.
