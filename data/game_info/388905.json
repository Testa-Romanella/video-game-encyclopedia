The monster sprite is original to this jam. This is a demo.\u00a0<br/></strong><br/><em>Mysterious sinkholes are opening up all over Lunaria's neighborhood. What could be the cause?</em><br/><br/>This is an otome game. It has cute boys.\u00a0Except it's also a horror* game. Play at your own risk! <br/><br/>It is also a demo for a longer game. Right now, it functions as a kinetic novel. You can play one entire route of about 20,000, without choices.\u00a0<br/><br/>*The horror is monstrous, existential and sometimes personal. There's no sexual assault or anything like that. I just want to get that out there. Sorry for the spoilers.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:38:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e51d073a02c1d81f4fad59923fa92805.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chrysoula Tzavelas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
