I did not complete any of the game's art, or audio, but I did play a substantial role in its design.</p><p>The objective of the game is to survive as many waves of killer snowmen as possible using a variety of weapons such as a shotgun, sniper rifle, and an axe! It plays much like Call of Duty: Zombies in that you must unlock areas of the map in order to increase your ability to avoid the horde and to also locate new weapons.</p><p>Presently, the game is only playable on Windows PCs as that was its state upon the completion of the school project period. I believe there is a lot of potential in this game's design, and I hope to be able to revamp its development in the future.</p><p>Now, go give our game a try! A game manual is provided in the download. </p><p>Feel free to comment and provide critique, as your feedback is greatly appreciated. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e16c78f659ced897d10e1590693aedf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameDevBriden"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
