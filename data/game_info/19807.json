{"id": 19807, "slug": "autumn", "name": "Autumn", "name_original": "Autumn", "description": "More than a game, Autumn is a relaxing place for spiritual learning and growth with a soothing atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn each game you play as a Spirit which depends on the natural world for its progress in life. As you help the world around you to thrive, you receive vital energy(Prana) in return. During the Autumn season, while the trees are shedding their leaves, orbs of Prana are released into the air, which you can absorb. Your own Prana can be utilized to help and change the world around you and to obtain spiritual teachings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMore than levels, puzzles or in-game progressions, Autumn\u2019s focus is on the growth of the player. Not the one in the game, but the one in the chair.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are no time limits, no enemies to defeat, no goals to reach\u2026 except the ones you set for yourself. Relax, learn, grow\u2026 and enjoy Autumn.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:43:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/043/0438413723094df3e5e83f56f95619db.jpg", "website": "http://www.bitoutsidethebox.com/autumn", "rating": 2.29, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 308, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nuno Donato"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nuno Donato"], "esrb_rating": null}
