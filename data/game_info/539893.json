In this game, you will be able to explore the different paths he and his fans took to reclaim what was theirs.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When a star runs out of hydrogen it starts to fuse other elements hoping to keep the energy flowing. When the star can burn no longer, it collapses in on itself, and explodes. The star ceases to exist, but in those final moments, it releases so much energy into space that it can lead to the formation of a brand new star.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the beginning, seven stars shone brightly in the sky. But forces attacked these stars - until one gave up its light to protect the rest, dimming the night sky. However, those who loved the seven stars hung on to the fading light of the seventh star and fought to reignite it. Together, the seventh star and his fans fought through online and offline efforts; and one day the star was reborn.</p>\n<p>At a time when Wonho, our star, faced a decision that would change the lives of millions, we dove into the unknown. Play as Wonho himself to see the different paths taken in the fight to bring back our star.</p>\n<p><em>Available in: English</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T06:06:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9e/b9e5b1fb7851637bf09b87f9c1df7ee6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Monbebe Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
