We were allowed to use any free assets or images from the internet as long as all teams would have had access to them during the Jam. My team consisted of: Maxim Isacov - Prop/Level Designer, Zara Nelson - Texture Artist, Casey Fisher - Team Manager/Organizer, Michael Clarke - Sound Designer and myself as the Programmer. Our project was set inside a dolls house and the character is a toy trying to get out as a child searches the house for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:03:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e1/6e155b62c396f3f87b9c22f1cb8d0d35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KRONOSott"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
