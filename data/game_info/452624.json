Your Rival is Silver but he is not as an antagonist, maybe he is similar to Barry or Blue. The Graphics are from the Pokemon Spaceworld demo with a new story, a new region. It&#39;s based on Nihon, Japan, new key items and evolution stones and more... Anyway, It&#39;s completed in English. And now, Let&#39;s go!</p>\n<p>You are a new trainer who sets out on a journey to help Professor Oak with researching Pokemon, very much like the very first games. This story is built on the foundation that was pulled from the demo itself and has you traverse Nihon, based on the entirety of Japan, while you collect badges and catch Pokemon. You&#39;ll also have to face off against Team Rocket, who are building a machine that would give them incredible power over Pokemon! Silver is portrayed in the manner that he was in the demo - not as an antagonist, but as an energetic rival, kind of similar to gen 4&#39;s Barry. The story is admittedly kind of simple, but intentionally so. It was written to feel like the story that might have been in the demo had it been completed.</p>\n<p>Features<br />\n-Version 2.00 out now! Adds revamped movesets and typings that more closely match the demo. Slight buffs to some trainers.<br />\n-Graphics fully pulled from the Spaceworld demo, complete with Pokemon sprites, overworld tilesets, trainer sprites, etc, along with a handful of sprites I had to redesign myself to better match the art style of the demo.<br />\n-251 Pokemon, the complete Pokedex as it appeared in the demo. The main way that this differs from what would have been in an &quot;official&quot; game is that all 251 Pokemon are obtainable in one save file.<br />\n-New key items that match the story presented in the game<br />\n-Evolutionary stones that match the Demo (Heart Stone, Poison Stone) as well as an additional Trade Stone that allows for the evolution of Pokemon that would normally require trading.<br />\n-8 badges, Pokemon League, like you would expect.<br />\n-A new postgame map not present in the Spaceworld demo<br />\n-Type chart that matches the beta (with option to use standard type chart if preferred)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4af5f421ecf8ca556467a83ebe848e3c.jpg", "website": "https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=430526", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Game Boy Color"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
