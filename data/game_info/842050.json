In order to escape, he will have to leave each of the rooms of this gloomy building, picking up all the stars and keys present, which will open the exit door.</p>\n<p>But be careful, Mabool is spherical in shape, and once launched, it can only stop if it encounters an obstacle (wall, star or another object...). So be careful not to fall into the void. Each trip will have to be carefully considered... To help him, he will find on his way very useful objects.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T14:46:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c295beb4c8b577e5e87b73985466f084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baptiste Bideaux"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
