Listen to the birds chirping. Feel the stillness of the forest and the calming sounds of the waterfall. Enjoy it while you can, because<strong> the clock is ticking!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In WildWood you will have to use your parkour skills and sense of direction to find orienteering checkpoints spread out in a beautiful forest. \r\n  </p>\n<p>You will be facing challenges which will require you to soar across cliff sides, lunge over treehouse platforms and swoop over old castle walls. Since you\u2019re racing against the clock, you\u2019ll want to do all of this as fast as you can. \r\n  </p>\n<p>We leave you with a map and a compass to dive into the beauty of the forest and in the end, <em>we hope you get lost in our game.\u00a0</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:26:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d39/d39a2153fe5310c939772cd37ae694f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Tree Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
