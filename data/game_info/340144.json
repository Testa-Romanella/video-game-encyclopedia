{"id": 340144, "slug": "fireballz-lava-labyrinth", "name": "Fireballz: Lava Labyrinth", "name_original": "Fireballz: Lava Labyrinth", "description": "Fireballz is a new take on the classic connect the dots puzzle games. You control a fire ball and navigate from dot to dot, setting your targets on fire. Doesn\u2019t sound too complex, right? Well, it actually is. Because in Fireballz, you are never alone. Ice balls are trying to destroy you!<br/><br/><br/>Ice vs. Fire<br/>There are 3 types of enemy ice balls, which create an infinity of combinations and scenarios. You will feel like you\u2019re navigating in a labyrinth that\u2019s changing at every step. This puzzle game isn\u2019t only an IQ test, but also a test of your mind\u2019s flexibility. <br/><br/>As you connect the dots, you burn everything. The goal is to ignite your targets. But beware! Ice balls can put out the fire! Remain calm and avoid them. If you collide with ice balls, it\u2019s like you fail the IQ test. The Ice vs. Fire dynamic is why every level feels so lively!<br/><br/><br/>Complex A.I. enemies<br/>Some ice balls are following you, others are cutting your path. Some ice balls explode like mines, others put out the fires you started. There are 3 types of enemies. Patrols navigate from dot to dot and if they collide with your fire ball, they send it into space in small pieces. Sentinels are more complex: they also move from dot to dot, but they eliminate any ignited ball in their path. But this also means you can navigate the same path twice! <br/><br/>Mines are static enemies which test your brain flexibility. After a certain number of moves, they will detonate and blow you into space! Here\u2019s a tip: you can trick them if you navigate not dot to dot, but take a shortcut through teleporters! ;) Ice balls keep you on your toes, they keep your brain active. Flexibility is a must if you want to solve all the levels of this labyrinth like puzzle game!<br/><br/><br/>Shield Protection<br/>As you connect the dots, ignite targets and solve levels, you will gain an invulnerability shield. This shield is lit! You collided with an ice ball? Stay calm! The shield is active and it protects you. It\u2019s your turn to send them into space.<br/><br/><br/>Calm &amp; Relaxing<br/>Our specialty have always been relaxing free games and this one makes no exception.
