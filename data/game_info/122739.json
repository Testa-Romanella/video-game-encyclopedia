Broadly : how to tell a story by interaction.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI developed it alone, under the supervision of <strong>David Calvo</strong>.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game is centered around the feeling of anxiety, but it's a game for all audiences, and is very short, <strong>5/10mn</strong> or less if you get touched by the figure.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt is in a release candidate state : there might still be some bugs but none that I noticed (maybe i'm lying ...)</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor feedback or criticisms feel free to contact me on twitter @ragekit</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Use the arrow keys to move, shift to run and the mouse to look around.<br/>You can rebind controls in the menu that appears at game start.
