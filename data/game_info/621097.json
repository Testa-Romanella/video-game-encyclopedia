{"id": 621097, "slug": "handcuffed-for-24-hours-challenge", "name": "HANDCUFFED FOR 24 HOURS CHALLENGE!!!", "name_original": "HANDCUFFED FOR 24 HOURS CHALLENGE!!!", "description": "<p>There's a trend going around on Youtube where you handcuff yourself to your significant other for a day and record your struggles, and you're going to hop on it.\u00a0 Try your best to keep the video entertaining while maintaining your own sanity.</p>\n<p>This\u00a0is intended for two players sharing a keyboard but can be completed single player. One character moves with WASD and the other with the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK Jam in the span of 48 hours. Due to some issues (described below), I will likely work on this game further and upload a completed version at a later date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DEV NOTE</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I was close to completing the household activities/ wellness stats mechanic, but unfortunately there were just too many pieces not working to continue messing with it and trying to get it into the game. I left the stats and the chore popups visible in the build so you can see the framework of what was supposed to happen, but took out the player's ability to interact with them.</p>\n<p>HOWEVER, you can still complete the other half of the game where you make choices about the video and play three minigames. I shortened the game's clock, originally from noon to noon but now noon to midnight, to accommodate the lack of interaction between functioning activities (now taking place at 3pm, 7pm, and midnight). You can explore the house and swing around each other in the meantime!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:27:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe4/fe40e633061e4efd0783e8f5f3875d88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ClaireNicolee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
