Luckily, you pick up a signal for a colonized planet nearby. There should be somewhere to refuel there.\r\n</p>\n<p>Unluckily for you, it turns out that the colony has been overtaken by sentient alien life. This would normally be bad news, but for a quick-witted space junker like you? This will be child's play. You might even find something good to sell on your mission!\r\n</p>\n<p>In the game Dust you must survive an onslaught of enemies on this foreign planet. CONFINED to being within your OX1Drone\u2019s range, you will have to fight for your life - and fuel!\r\n</p>\n<p>Credit's</p>\n<p>Art &amp; Animation by SassyGuac\r\n</p>\n<p>Coding by Tricgered</p>\n<p>TwoCellStudios Twitter</p>\n<p>Assets used:\r\n</p>\n<p>Humble Fonts - Gold\u00a0 \u00a0 By Eeve Somepx</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T18:52:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43a/43a12825c08cc1fbae80cfe90d66c32a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TwoCellStudios"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
