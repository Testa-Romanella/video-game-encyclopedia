This is currently a prototype for a (hopefully) soon-to-be much larger and much more ambitious game project! It's all a little rough around the edges but we hope you enjoy it and leave all the feedback! All criticisms are extremely appreciated in order to make this game even better for future releases!</p>\n<p>Manichaeid tells the story of Zai, a lost forest spirit who finds his home threatened by a sudden imbalance. A tear in space has caused the world of the spirits and the world of monsters to merge, threatening the very fabric of reality in the form of a tear in space. Zai, with the help of the other spirits of the forest and a new found ability, must go seek out a solution to repair this rift and restore balance to both worlds. With a treacherous forest, dangerous demons, and a mountain of puzzles, Zai will have to use everything they have at their disposal to save their world.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Tae Hassoun - Main Unity Programmer</li><li>Nayven Vignette - Audio Design + Secondary Unity Programmer</li><li>Natalie Summers - 2D Assets, Icons, and UI Design, Level Design</li><li>Matt Ryle - 2D Assets, Level Design, 3D Model Lead\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T07:53:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/585/58581a77bc4d7c1d89ce38347056bde5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tae"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
