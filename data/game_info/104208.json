Let me tell you something about myself.\u00a0I am just a regular girl who works at a coffee shop and loves her job. Seeing the happy faces of customers when I serve them their favorite drinks is a thing that makes me happy too. I am still a bit clumsy at the job, but I try to improve every day :D\r\nAround this time of year, it gets really stressful in the coffee shop and sometimes we have to deal with difficult customers. Despite all that\u00a0I am really motivated. Could you help me to make this day at work a success? ;)\r\n\n<strong>Gameplay:\u00a0</strong>\n<p>Play as Valerie, a waitress at a small coffee shop. Help her to make her day successful and customers happy by giving them what they want. Customers will issue their orders to you and your job is it to serve them a cup of delicious coffee (or sometimes they are fine with just milk or sugar too). They get mad and will leave if you give them the wrong ingredients or too much of a certain ingredient.\u00a0Some customers are also impatient, so you have to hurry to complete their order or they will just leave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make as many customers as possible\u00a0happy by serving them properly. Making customers happy makes you happy and will also increase the profit of the coffee. They are more likely to come back to the coffee shop and who knows.. maybe they will bring some friends too! <br/></p>\n<strong>Features:\u00a0</strong>\n\n<ul><li>Charming and original anime-style art</li><li>Short and simple but engaging gameplay</li><li>Progressive difficulty - the better you do the harder the game gets</li><li>Multiple endings</li><li>COFFEE</li></ul>\n\n\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A</strong> - Pour Coffee</p>\n<p><strong>S</strong> - Pour Milk</p>\n<p><strong>D</strong> - Pour Sugar</p>\n<p><strong>Left/Right Arrow</strong> - Move/Switch to other\u00a0customer</p>\n\n<strong>Creators:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>FMProductions:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>fleshmobproductions@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Programming, In-Engine Animations, UI-Layout-Design, Writing\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Blank Canvas:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>contactartbc@gmail.com</p>\n<p>2D Art, 2D Animations, UI Icon + Layout Design</p>\n\n\n<p>Have fun with the game!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc6a72e5088f0e0b132ac5f20b8facb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["FMProductions"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
