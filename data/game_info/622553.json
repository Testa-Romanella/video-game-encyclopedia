Use classic shooter weapons like the Sniper or Doob Tube, along side new and unique guns like the Defenestrator to finesse your way to victory. When you aren't competing, you can explore the world of Four Shores discovering collectables, making friends or grinding your stats for the next battle. Also there is a flying dog named Friend.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCredits:<br/>\r\nJoseph Keenan - Jazzcharles Games<br/>\r\nErica Enriquez - Art<br/>\r\nLauren Maraday - Art<br/>\r\nCasey Tebbetts - QA Team<br/>\r\nThomas Pruitt - QA Team<br/>\r\nRicky Williams - QA Team<br/>\r\nAlec Romano - QA Team<br/>\n<br/>\r\nP.S. A few of you bought the game at the price of $9.99 which I greatly appreciate! I intended for the release to have a discount, but messed up in the distribution process. Anyway now the game is $5.99. Just reach out to me at coranfps@gmail.com, and I'll send you a refund or a free key. Thanks for being awesome and buying Coran first.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T02:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9d/e9dee2defab0230cb5972d09fa07e368.jpg", "website": "https://pheenomusic.wordpress.com/jazzcharles-games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Keenan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jazzcharles Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
