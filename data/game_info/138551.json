The daughter of the manor lord has run away into the woods and a hunter has been dispatched to rescue her -- but there is a reason why the child ran away, and accordingly a decision you must make. Sought has six possible endings, a randomly generated maze on each play, and supports USB gamepads.</p>\n<p><strong>System Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>We've tested this game on Windows 7 and OS X 10.7, but it should work under other recent versions of both operating systems.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cb/3cbabe42f60f9bfb07d73f6628f991cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Twofold Secret"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
