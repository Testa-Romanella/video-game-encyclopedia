First find the silver key to open the wooden door. Then get the gold key and exit the stage via the steel door. Shoot the enemies. Fire at the crates and the grass to reveal powerups that help you in your quest. Collect coins to buy powerups in the store inbetween stages. Maze Dude is a retro game inspired by early arcade titles such as Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. Stages are randomly generated which means you will never play the same stage twice!
