{"id": 902069, "slug": "the-lost-ship-itch", "name": "The Lost Ship (itch)", "name_original": "The Lost Ship (itch)", "description": "<p>You're a 16-bit space ship lost in the future fantasy realm of classic arcade games. You must kill the enemies, stay alert for power ups that can help you move ahead in your home-search journey, and trace any signals you may receive.</p>\n<p>This was built as a part of the MSU Game Design and Development course, mostly utilising the provided assets except for a few add-ons. The\u00a0\u00a0modifications I have made include:</p>\n<p>1. Updated in-game screens:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 Floating effect for Menu Page</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 Introduction and intermediate screens to guide the player through the gameplay</p>\n<p>- Pause screen with live-updated status for the player to keep track</p>\n<p>-Hearts bar to show the number of lives remaining</p>\n<p>2. Story Design</p>\n<p>-Developed a narrative surrounding a lost ship held hostage by an enemy planet trying to find its way back home</p>\n<p>-Worked the game mechanics and environment to make sense within the context.</p>\n<p>3. Modified Gameplay</p>\n<p>-Inserted contextual power-ups to help characters ascend through the levels</p>\n<p>-Conditionally destructible environment\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Two fully designed and developed levels with distinct yet similar core mechanics that align with the narrative.</p>\n<p>-Used spatial sound as a guiding tool for a \"follow the signal\" element\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Created a Boss Enemy</p>\n<p>-Added elements like Space Stations which spawn enemies ceaselessly until blasted.</p>\n<p>Further plan:</p>\n<p>- Similar to how the first two levels mimic some of the classic shoot 'em tropes, I plan to make\u00a0a couple other levels tying the gameplay mechanics to narrative.</p>\n<p>- To revamp the visual design of the game, as I'm currently limited by my lack of technical art design skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T08:06:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23a9b68a5b7f2152e924ee1e0078a720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["keshabagadia"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
