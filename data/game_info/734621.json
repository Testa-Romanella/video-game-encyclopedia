It&#39;s dungeon crawler game that lets you play as a ghost from a different (top-down) perspective after you die, allowing you to explore the map and revive yourself on specific locations. This adds a whole new level of depth to classic first person role-playing experience, and in the same time results in fun gameplay. 5 complex dungeons to explore, numerous monster and characters to meet, weapons to find, objects to use and combine, adventure-like puzzles to solve. The game could use more variety in graphics and its gameplay does have few clunky elements, but the sheer volume of features and its original concept overcome the game&#39;s flaws.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T00:52:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d8651f3291144840e7858bc755c8fe65.jpg", "website": "https://games.freebasic.net/dumpbyid.php?input=163", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
