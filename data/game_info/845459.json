Does she join the anime club, despite (or maybe because of) the bizarre-but-also-hot club president? And most importantly,\u00a0can she find somebody to tell her secret to? Hijinks and Big Gender Feels abound.<br/><br/>This 2-3 hour story is a kinetic novel, so there are no branching paths.\u00a0Instead, just relax and enjoy one single story told using words, sounds, and images.<br/><br/>Character art by the wonderful\u00a0Maika!
