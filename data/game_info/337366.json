As the name implies, these plugins will change the RPG Maker MV engine that you have as an editor for Turn Based Strategy genre games like Fire Emblems.</p>\n<p>The following are the features of these plugins:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Provides feature complete of basic SRPG engine</strong>. Watch your RPG Maker MV turn into a Turn Based Strategy engine;</li><li><strong>High compatibility with many plugins</strong>. There are almost no RPG maker MV Core scripts that we touch, so you can still use RPG Maker MV and your favorite plugins as usual;</li><li><strong>Easy to customize</strong>. Every character, weapon, skill, or class can be customized using notetag;</li><li><strong>Can be extended with extension</strong>. This plugin is designed so that anyone who has knowledge of Javascript can easily add features that are not yet available;</li><li><strong>Royalty free for commercial purposes</strong>. With the MIT license, anyone can use this plugin without worrying about legal issues. As long as you comply with the provisions of the MIT license, this plugin can be used for any purpose</li></ul>\n<p>Making the SRPG Engine is a complex thing, even comparable to making a new engine that is equivalent to the RPG Maker MV Core scripts itself. Before I introduce this system to the community, I am using this plugin internally for my own projects. I don't want to become the only one who get the benefits of this plugin, which become the reason I translated it and share it here.</p>\n<p>Additional feature in the future:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>On Map Battle</strong>. Do battle on the map without entering MV battle scene.</li><li><strong>Mouse System</strong>. Improve mouse system navigation.</li></ul>\n<p>Since the era of RPG Maker XP, I have never seen a SRPG system that is truly complete. There are at least two possibilities: Kadokawa had already made a new version of RPG Maker before the SRPG System was completed, or the creator of the SRPG System was busy or had other interests that caused this project to be abandoned. Then I decided to offer myself to the author by help pushing the system forward. If you are a Javascript programmer, you can help by creating extension for this system.<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Author:</strong>\u00a0Gakuto Mikagami</li><li><strong>Translation:</strong>\u00a0Me (Ryan Bram) and future collaboration with the original Author</li><li><strong>License:</strong>\u00a0MIT</li><li><strong>Non-commercial use:</strong>\u00a0free</li><li><strong>Commercial use:</strong>\u00a0free</li><li><strong>Redistribution:</strong>\u00a0OK</li><li><strong>Editing:</strong>\u00a0OK</li><li><strong>Redistribution after editing:</strong>\u00a0OK</li><li><strong>Series:</strong>\u00a0RPG Maker MV</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ece/eced8296cb0ce2759cdd99cbd8f7cdcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyanBram"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
