Whenever the ball falls off the map, players are sent back to the \"lobby\" level and have to restart. The last map however, holds a little surprise and players respawn into the same level even if they fall off because of the difficulty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The propellers and falling barriers add extra intensity to the game. The game is also decorated with a halloween theme because we are nearing it.</p><p>Edit: Now players spawn to the same level to lower the difficulty of finishing.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T08:01:46", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["smlim991"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
