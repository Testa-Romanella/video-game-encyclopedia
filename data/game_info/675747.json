You\u2019ll receive a series of scenarios that Caleb encounters, and for each one, a Council of Emotions that convenes in Caleb\u2019s mind votes on what they think he should do. Ultimately, you make the choice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But be careful! If an emotion\u2019s counsel is heeded too often or not often enough, they leave the Council. If the Council loses three members, you lose. If Caleb completes enough scenarios while retaining Council members, you are the winner! Your score is based on the choices you made and how many members are left at the end.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Can you keep the Council stable? Or will chaos rule Caleb\u2019s mind?\r\n</p>\n<p>Created in 72 Hours for Ludum Dare 49!</p>\n<ul><li>Code:\u00a0Unity, Visual Studio, Notepad++</li><li>Art:\u00a0Photoshop, Paint.net</li><li>Audio:\u00a0Logic Studio, Audacity</li><li>Collaboration:\u00a0Google Docs, Google Drawings</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:22:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17c/17c62801e12bff7bce74a759bb6cca9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["squirmonkey", "jlevine1121"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
