So,\u00a0I did that! Entered into the Great Spring Game Jam: 2021 and Mundane Jam. I present to you; A Mundane Spring!\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is one part puzzle game, akin to the old analog game Mastermind, by picking the proper planting order. And one part old arcade-style game, by pulling weeds, watering flowers, and digging up rocks. Can you plant and maintain the garden? The controls are simple, point and click. Click the soil you want to plant in, then click\u00a0seeds to choose the planting order. Once the main loop begins, start clicking on weeds to pull them up, but don't forget to watch the Hydration Meter on the left side! Click the water can on the right to fill it back up.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T05:24:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/752/752f365a70ec5c422c7d05ff1b3ee06e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheSyXan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
