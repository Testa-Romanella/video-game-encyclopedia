You can't be hurt in Tiger-Snake form, but you cannot pick up items. Create a path that will allow your minions to collect treasure while keeping them safe from harm.</p>\n<p>Unlike other snakes, a Tiger-Snake can loop back on itself just fine, and won't be hurt by running into walls.</p>\n<p>To exit the level, you will need to collect keys. If none of your minions make it to the exit alive, you will lose a life.</p>\n\n<p><em>Credits:</em></p>\n<p>Snake by Lazy Fox</p>\n<p>https://lazy-fox.itch.io/snake-asset</p>\n<p>Tileset by Canari Games</p>\n<p>https://canarigames.itch.io/canaripack-1bit-topdown</p>\n<p>VFX by Ansimuz</p>\n<p>https://ansimuz.itch.io/warped-vfx-pack-1</p>\n<p>Tiger by Markiro</p>\n<p>https://markiro.itch.io/tiger</p>\n<p>Sprites by 0x72</p>\n<p>https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii</p>\n<p>Music &amp; EFX by Joel Steudler</p>\n<p>www.patreon.com/joelsteudler</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T18:49:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/783682981432d53d5a6ab495bb476f83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SlightlyMadman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
