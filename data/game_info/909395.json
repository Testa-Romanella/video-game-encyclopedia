Cards can affect each other.</li><li>There is no mana or energy, cards have lifetime. Lifetime is consumed every time a card is played, and then the card is discarded.</li></ul>\n<p>It may come back in the future as a different game - who knows?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:19:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b1131061eb0c2f2afe54b59917d462a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SKYLE"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
