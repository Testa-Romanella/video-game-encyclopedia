The main aspect of this game will be finding hidden areas and trying your level best to escape the place. There will be unknowns which you need to discover, what those items are used for, why they are even there in the first place. Which door is locked and which door is not. Think of it as a real life scenerio. Wasting means doomed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Since this game has been newly released, there might be some bugs or issues and if you do find any then make sure to DM on us Instagram or Discord, all links will be given below!</em></p>\n<p><em>There are keys, treasures, medkits, lights and more. Make sure not to waste any sort of ammo since they are limited.</em></p>\n<p><em>In total there are 2 Floors, which you need to escape.</em></p>\n<p>There isn't any time limit since it would make it way more tensed but later we will be adding leaderboard to see who conquered the dungeon in small amount of time.\u00a0<br/><br/>Items:</p>\n<ol><li>Keys</li><li>Lights</li><li>Treasures</li><li>Health</li><li>Gun</li><li>Bullets</li><li>\u00a0Experimentation\u00a0</li></ol>\r\n~ Creators: Dawn's light Studio ~", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T11:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e54320311a718a393becbf6405fa2770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kirit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
