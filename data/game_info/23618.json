Implanted with cybernetic controls, all are now under complete control, all but you. The Sarkad and Onton empires have moved from the final forward base used to enslave mankind leaving their primary forward research facility exposed. Having avoided assimilation, you have broken in to the research center and stolen the Sar-On BattleStar prototype. A swift series of actions can disable the near by warp gates and strand the Sarkad and Onton Fleets in Andromeda where the first major war of their new expansion is being fought. Time is short.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTwo dozen star systems represent the battleground where almost a dozen wormhole/star gates must be destroyed. Scraps for upgrading and crystals for proton quantum torpedo's must be collected as you blast your way through the galaxy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\nResource farming and required planning of use for upgrades to four weapon types with eighty available upgrades.<br/>\r\n20 star systems with increasing difficulty both in base firepower and fleet support.<br/>\r\nOver twenty different enemy craft and base ships.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T09:45:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f4/0f4dadcd059589ce99c81f9586d58b06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.4, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 115, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 6544, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G.Malta"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VRS"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
