Difficulty increases with every stage, but <strong>you don't have to beat the whole game to unlock all pictures.</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-24T21:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/599/5995d7b7cd48e538e09c34fc65d7779f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelGreeds"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PixelGreeds"], "esrb_rating": null}
