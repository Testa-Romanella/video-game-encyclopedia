The Jam's limitation was <strong>\"1 minute timer\"</strong> with the theme <strong>Gold.\u00a0</strong>So, as the lover of puns that I am, Time is Gold was born.</p>\n\n<p>It's a very simple one-level platformer with the goal being of reaching the end with the biggest amount of gold, or time left, possible. The style is heavily inspired by Thomas was Alone, which was a perfect match for my art-stunted self.</p>\n\r\nCrediting:\r\n<p>The icon of this game is a modified version of a sprite provided by pixel frog under a CC0 license, https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/</p>\n<p>The fonts, icons and sound effects were provided by Kenney (www.kenney.nl) under a CC0 license</p>\n<p>And a special thanks to\u00a0Eli Cuaycong, for the fast and informative videos\u00a0check his youtube channel</p>\n<p>Also special thanks for the Godot team for making such an awesome engine\u00a0https://godotengine.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T06:14:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fd/1fd73c801ea7c63cf30688e7487a8c71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BeatrizTDias"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
