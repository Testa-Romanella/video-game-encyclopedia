The board consists of four free cells, four home cells and eight columns. The goal is to place all 52 cards in the home cells, forming four stacks, one for each suit, in ascending order from ace to king. Moves to a column must be made in descending order, alternating colors. Only the cards at the bottom of the columns or in the free cells can be moved. A free cell can contain no more than one card at a time.<br/><br/>Odesys FreeCell Features:<br/>\u2022 Select any game from 1 to 1000000<br/>\u2022 Landscape and portrait orientation<br/>\u2022 Unlimited Undo and Redo<br/>\u2022 Adjustable cards size (pinch-to-resize)<br/>\u2022 Sound<br/>\u2022 Hints<br/>\u2022 Timer<br/>\u2022 Auto save on exit<br/>\u2022 Animations<br/>\u2022 Auto collect<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @OdesysSolitaire<br/><br/>Look for other great patience games by Odesys.
