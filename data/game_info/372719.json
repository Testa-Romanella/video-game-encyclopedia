Gameplay evolves from a game of slow exploration in the darkness to super-fast races in serpentine corridors.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Maze is draining life strength out of travelers. That is why in order to have enough time to get to the end it is not enough just to explore the maze and to find the right way. You also need to use gold, found in the maze, to increase key skills of the character: speed and light radius.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo improve the character skills, you need to come back to the maze entrance. If the character\u2019s health drops down to zero your character dies. Bones and found gold mark the spot where your character dies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to mentioned above, you will use magic shining sand marking your path and health improving phials that you find in the maze (you will have to remember where they are placed, as you won\u2019t stand a chance without them).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNotes found in the furthest corners of the maze will tell the curious short stories from the maze\u2019s universe.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T03:56:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67e61e013bd6fc684981f27c5bdd3a49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Savestar Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Savestar Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
