The main idea of this game is that you can switch between two different dimensions, objects will be in one dimension but not the other. This was only made in about 2 days due to personal time constraints so there are obviously a lot of improvements to be made but I'm still pretty proud of it. Please let me know if you liked this concept along with any suggestions\u00a0as I may expand on it in the future if it gets some positive feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Retro (programming, sfx, 3d models)</p>\n<p>Icoso (music)</p>\n<p>Kenney Assets\u00a0(where I got my UI elements and fonts from :p )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T10:04:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20c/20c9a0aa177d875a9a80ac2ffea3decb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Retro"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
