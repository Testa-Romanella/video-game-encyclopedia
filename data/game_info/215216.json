Instead the player has to rely on\u00a0 AI controlled teammates (which are terrible); once they're killed the player must run to them and revive them.</p>\n<p>That was the idea... whether or not it came to fruition is for you to decided.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls are:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - MOVE</p>\n<p>E (on downed ally) - REVIVE</p>\n<p>SPACE - SPRINT (Maybe, I can't remember if I took it out or not)</p>\n<p>Hopefully you'll enjoy playing it, just as much as I did making it -\u00a0even though it is a broken mess.\u00a0But what do you expect? This is my first game and I made it in 10 hours... Well, okay more like a day and a half; but without further adieu, I bid you adieu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d1be8c8e969881a8ce1900418434466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Isidore"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
