But he is too busy watching his show. Tina said that she invited his pals, Bonnie the rabbit and Kit the cat to play. What Tina said got Ted in the mood to play. So when he counts to ten, he is off to find his friends, not in his house, but outside on a beautiful day! Only you can help him find his pals by searching through the forest. But do keep in mind that their heads fall off behind the bushes, trees and/or rocks when trying to find a place to hide. Good luck! Have fun!</p>\n<p>Also, I\u00a0don't know how to make things not spawn anymore when you found them. Many apologies for that. Will update by fixing stuff\u00a0and add some more endings in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:23:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49d/49d6c9ef138a0509672681da40e29da8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Enophano"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
