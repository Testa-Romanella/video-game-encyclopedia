Breaking a bridge gives you back the materials.</p>\n<p>You can press down on the S key to see if any bridge slots are nearby, or to pick up any materials. Press W while pressing S to place a bridge. The R key switches bridges, and the F key destroys your current bridge (or, if S is held, the nearest bridge).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Esc - Exit</p>\n<p>A / Left\u00a0Arrow\u00a0- Left</p>\n<p>D\u00a0/ Right Arrow - Right</p>\n<p>W\u00a0/ Up Arrow - Up</p>\n<p>S - Find Slots, Combo Slot Action, Grab Ingredients</p>\n<p>F - Destroy</p>\n<p>S + F - Destroy Bridge at Nearest Slot</p>\n<p>S + W - Place Bridge at Nearest Slot</p>\n<p>R - Switch Bridges</p>\n<p>Q - Quickly Attack</p>\n<p>E - Hold Bridge</p>\n<p>1 - 6 - Creates types of bridges based on whether or not you have the necessary materials.
