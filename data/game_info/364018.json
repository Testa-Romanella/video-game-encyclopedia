This is where the resource management aspect of the game comes in to play as you must build and maintain an Enchanted Cave in order to channel energy back into the earth. A large group of NPCs and monsters will both aid and hinder you in your progress to restore the land to its former self. This is not the only aspect of the game, however, as there are portions of each Scenario in which you must venture in to town to progress events in the storyline. The choices you make during these events can drastically alter the way each Scenario plays out, allowing for multiple endings and adding much incentive to replay each part of the story.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-15T17:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/870/8706abaab2f8b004746113d389451dde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "SNES"], "developers": ["Neverland"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
