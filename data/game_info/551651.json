You play as some kind of vortex creature, being assailed by horrible fleshy enemies. If you shoot at them enough - they die! Wow! And, that's not all, when they die they explode into parts, which you can use to build yourself bigger and bigger.</p>\n<p>I was originally going to have more mechanics to do with this theme of growing bigger, like getting upgrades and different weapons and stuff as you take on more parts but you know how it is with one-person jams! Still, I'm very happy with this and I hope you enjoy it : )<br/></p>\n<p>I made all the sound effects and music and art and stuff too, so that's cool. The music is dynamic (both horizontally and vertically mixed)\u00a0and changes a bit as you play the game</p>\n<p>Also, please have a warning that the enemy designs might be a bit scary for some people!</p>\n<p>Have a nice day ^_^</p>\n<p>-Kimera</p><p>Also, you can get the music for free at\u00a0https://kimroyal.bandcamp.com/track/theseus\u00a0(or spend a little bit of money on it if you would like to be nice...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T10:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/477/4772e435505baeda666fbb8dc1a50ce5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KIM ROYAL"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
