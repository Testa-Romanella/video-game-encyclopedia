{"id": 131167, "slug": "black-box-bumblebeary", "name": "Black Box (bumblebeary)", "name_original": "Black Box (bumblebeary)", "description": "<p>In this visual novel, Demi wakes up during a work conference only to discover that her coworkers may have a pretty big secret, big enough to warrant renting out a big black box tent. Ever-determined, she decides to find out what exactly the company, and her future hold.</p>\n<p>To be honest, this game is really about coming to terms that we're all doing the best that we can. Whether big or small, we can make each other's worlds a better place. I know my art could improve, but I wanted to try doing all aspects of the story at least once. Constructive criticism, compliments, and fan art\u00a0always welcome ^-^</p>\n<p>It's about 19k words, 4 different endings (one of which is after the first choice, pretty straightforward. There is one optional romance route and some dark themes, but there's quite a bit of humor as well. If you can't get voice acting to come up, play with the Voice Sustainable option in the preferences and the volume control.</p>\n<p>Want updates?
