In fact thats why I decided to create this game. My Wi-Fi went out and I played it for a bit and then decided I wanted to try and make my own version of it. Also I am aware that the name of this game sucks xD<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Jump over the incoming obstacles and score a point every time you do. Try to get the highest score that you can.
