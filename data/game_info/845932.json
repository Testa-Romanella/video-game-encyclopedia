{"id": 845932, "slug": "t-surf-prototype", "name": "T-Surf Prototype", "name_original": "T-Surf Prototype", "description": "<p>A prototype game project made as a school graduation project.<br/></p>\n<p>It is heavily inspired by the Treasure Planet game on PS2 by\u00a0Bizarre Creations.</p>\n<p>It includes 2 levels, each with multiple challenges and activities you can do in any order you wish. These include:</p>\n<ul><li>Time-Trial - Race through the checkpoint gates\u00a0as quickly as you can to beat the best time.</li><li>Ring Race - Race through a series of rings before time runs out. Each ring will add to the timer.</li><li>Trick Challenge - Jump off of ramps and preform tricks in the air to earn points within the time limit. Try to beat the high-score. (This one is only in the mountain level. The one you start in.)</li><li>Collectables - In each level are a number of green orb...things. Get 'em all.</li></ul>\n<p>Since this was the first out of the two projects I did for my graduation, it is pretty rough around the edges. Most of the game was made in only a month and I spent an additional month during the following semester adding\u00a0new features, a new level and making it look a bit more presentable (the first level was just gray-box for that first month). So there are some bugs and jank due to that shaky foundation. If I could go back and\u00a0start over knowing what I know now I would do things pretty differently (Heck, maybe I will do that if I have time).</p>\n<p>The main bug to look out for is problems with the collision of the board. If it gets stuck in some way, try performing a trick with the Q,E or F keys, that should get you un-stuck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T18:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/996/99627f12971103591ba56b28462f9ff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kjartant1905"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
