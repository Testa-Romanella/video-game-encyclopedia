When the player steps onto one, it is applied to the next qubits. Red platforms are quantum platforms, one row of them represents two qubits. Each gate operation can change the probability of where the platform is. When the player steps onto the quantum row, an observation is made and superposition of qubits collapse to a single platform.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T02:51:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c30/c3037d73b97348cbca3b2fa5f6920828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["berkaybor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
