The goal is to destroy the alien eggs laid in the hallways (like the dots in Pac-Man). Additionally, &quot;pulsars&quot; (similar to the power pills in Pac-Man) occasionally appear which turn the tables, allowing the human to overpower the aliens.</p>\n<p>Despite having many features heavily stylised after Pac-Man, it has the inclusion of a bonus round after each successfully completed stage.
