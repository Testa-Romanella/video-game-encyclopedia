You can use your meter to unleash powerful moves, if the moves land you get overwhelming advantage but if they miss you waste your meter. Its all about that meter.<br/><br/><strong>RAGE</strong><br/><br/>Low on health? Your opponent would be more worried than you because a player on low health gains access to rage, making that player a much bigger threat on low health. In rage, you become fast, small and explosive so taking out your opponent is a piece of cake.<br/><br/><strong>ONLINE AND OFFLINE MULTIPLAYER</strong><br/><br/>You can play online with up to 8 players and offline with splitscreen for 2 players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T04:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b68/b68dbe4cdcdbc4229afa6f4d7e125918.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ra Aten", "Suraj Bakawat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Ra Aten"], "esrb_rating": null}
