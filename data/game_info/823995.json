A place to personalize according to your desire, which has some premises for some adventures. A criminal family, an abandoned railroad, an angry widow.

An auto-destructive, violent and LSD-infused take on Spaghetti Westerns, about wanted outlaws making their mark on an unreal Lost Frontier. Probably getting shot before having the chance to shoot. A\u00a0rough-and-tumble world of insatiable greed where scum live one slug from the\u00a0grave.\u00a0Inspired by such things as El Topo, Dead Man, and Bone Tomahawk.
