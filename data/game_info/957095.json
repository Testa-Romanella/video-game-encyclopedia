However, due to the recency of the technology, it still has many flaws. You are equipped with experimental engines and a warp drive, and you are tasked with finding the wreck of the EV Triumph, a large exploratory ship which lost contact on its journey through deep space. The reason was unknown, but you suffer the same fate.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBrace for a journey into the unknown. Explore a massive wreck and salvage materials to get out of your time-limited survival situation as quickly as possible. Every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death: Resourcefulness and strategy will be tested as you scavenge for supplies, and your ever decreasing oxygen levels keep you on your toes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T10:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/219/2192345d8200ec1579f6ac08d418a84a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gingeh", "Pat Traynor"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pat Traynor"], "esrb_rating": null}
