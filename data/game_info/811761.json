At the start of each race you're able to choose one of three vehicles based on what's needed for the track and the weather you're presented with.</p><p>WARNING: This is the game jam version, it is not in the best state, only the Banada map works, the fixed version should be up on my itch in not too much video. Use the second build as on it you choose the map yourself and its not randomized.
