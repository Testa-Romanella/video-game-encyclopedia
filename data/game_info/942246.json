You can control the car with either Arrow keys or WASD, it also kind of \u201cunofficially \u201d supports a controller but I have only tested that once so it might be a bit buggy! Once you are in the menu just press \u201cPlay\u201d and it will take you into the game, QUICK THE POLICE ARE AFTER YOU!</p>\n<p>BTW: you increase your score by making the police crash into each other</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T14:38:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0b8c2f6fdcca3d20c857bc544c43389.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SecretGameDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
