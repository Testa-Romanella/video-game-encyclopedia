But it had to happen under the right circumstances. You wouldn't want to bring a dog, while your soulmate is alergic to dogs. Everyone would have different love interests that would help these people get together.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Also their happyness is connected to each other, this spiritual connecting can raise the joy in both when one of them has a good experience. (Like someone finding flowers when they are a Flower-Lover) But when they get to many bad experiences they will decide this just isn't their day, go home and most likely never meet each other again.</p>\n<p>You as overseeing entity can use your fate-bending skills to summon different object. Dogs running around or a sudden boost in speed can help the lovers meet at the right moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly, we didn't get to finish the gameplay. But we are still very proud of what we put together in these 2 amazing days. Thanks for checking us out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:24:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e74/e7432b2945feba4c60e36db3bbd90b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CatmanJunior", "petesails389"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
