It\u2018s a race against time to navigate the city and pick up fares before your customer\u2018s wallet is as empty as your gas tank.\r\nJust remember, the only thing more\r\nimportant than getting to your\r\ndestination is getting paid!</p>\n\n<p>Two players team up to navigate the city as a taxi driver and navigator duo. The taxi driver plays on the computer, while the navigator uses playing cards to figure out the correct intersection exits. The driver knows the destination but not the way, while the navigator knows the direction but not the driver's location. With limited info and no view of each other's game, the pair must work together to reach the goal before the time runs out. Will you make it to the end, or end up hopelessly lost in the city's maze of streets?</p>\n\r\nGamerules\r\n\r\n<p>\u2022 As the taxi driver, your job is to find the destination, but you have no idea where you're going. You only know your starting point.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 You'll navigate by the colors of buildings, parks, and monuments at each intersection. Good luck!</p>\n<p>\u2022 The navigator will help you find the way, but he will need your description to find the correct card!</p>\n<p>\u2022 The clock is ticking - you must get to the goal before the taximeter runs out!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Remember, you can only see your part of the game, so don't withhold, skip, or lose control!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Controls:<br/><strong>W-A-S-D</strong>: Drive taxi<br/><strong>Space</strong>: Brake<br/><strong>E</strong>: Sound horn<br/><strong>P</strong>: Pause game<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a game created for the Dung GameJam with the theme of\u00a0\u201aYou can't control the player'.
