To do so, press the right button at the right moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the right buttons?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, you have three possible lanes where the squares are thrown. The upper lane, the mid lane and the lower lane. For each lane you have a button to make the square on it bounce (Check to be in azerty before playing).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the right moment?</strong></p>\n<p>When a square is on your racket/bouncing zone (the thin vertical grey line), you can make it bounce. Be careful! If you press the button while there is no square on your racket of the corresponding lane, you lose health points.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the other things to know?</strong></p>\n<p>Know that each time you make a square bounce, its speed will increase. Also, you have a bunch of other features: </p>\n<p>- You can choose between different game modes and speed. You can also tweak some parameters to make the game easier, harder or even more dumb.<br/></p>\n<p>- There is a trickshot system, healing you when you make 2 or 3 squares bounce in a very short amount of time.</p>\n<p>- There is a combo system letting you entering a sort of rage mode making the game a hell lot faster for a short duration. Squares will deal more damage on your opponent and you will regen a bit for each bounce you make.</p>\n<p>- You can earn some portal allowing to teleport some squares incoming on your opponent. To do so, keep pressed a key of your choice and different from the bouncing keys, then press also the key corresponding to the lane on which the square you want to teleport is (This is very unclear, but anyway it's kind of a pgm move so it's not that important).</p>\n<p>- You can play against a little AI. Just a stupid one throwing randomly squares at you and make the square bounce all the time. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to win?</strong></p>\n<p>Just kick the ass of you opponent's healthbar. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bindings:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Player 1</p>\n<p>Upper : z (azerty) / w (qwerty)\r\n<br/>Mid : e\r\n<br/>Lower : f\r\n<br/>Throw : q (azerty) / a (qwerty)\r\n</p>\n<p>Player 2</p>\n<p>Upper : p\r\n<br/>Mid : o\r\n<br/>Lower : k\r\n<br/>Throw : \u00f9 (azerty) / ; (qwerty)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important things:</strong></p>\n<p>- Be sure to play with an AZERTY configuration.</p>\n<p>- I'm neither a game designer, a developer nor a graphic artist so if it's \"\u00e9clat\u00e9 au sol\", as we can say in french, then it's normal.</p>\n<p>- Alt+F4 to exit because it's \"\u00e9clat\u00e9 au sol\".<br/></p>\n<p>- Go kick some ass.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- Made with Unity and Fmod.</p>\n<p>- Design : Valentin di Domenico, K\u00e9vin Teyssier<br/></p>\n<p>- Development : Valentin di Domenico<br/></p>\n<p>- Music:\u00a0 </p>\n<ul><li> Fastway - Rockin Hardcore</li><li>Max Coveri - Running in the 90s</li><li>Manuel - GAS GAS GAS</li><li>Dejo &amp; Bon - Wheelpower &amp; Go!</li><li>The Immortals - Techno Syndrome</li></ul>\n<p>- Voices:</p>\n<ul><li>Announcer: Mortal Kombat</li><li>Players: Kenshiro</li></ul>\n<p>- SFX:</p>\n<ul><li>Dragon Ball Z</li><li>Me</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T04:31:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/417/417d08b7eaed512e453f4e313490b4f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Valentin di Domenico"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
