I played it for countless hours.<br/></p>\n<p>The Goal is simple, you try to stay alive as long as possible by dodging the Pointy boiz and the Lazer Dudes by switching the gravity\u00a0while listening to a chill song.</p>\n<p>The controls are simple: WASD or Arrow keys to switch the gravity.</p>\n<p>Not sure if I'll continue working on it even if I have quite a few cool ideas for it... I guess it depends on the feedback I get!</p>\n<p>The game is surprisingly relaxing, give it a try ;)</p>\n\n<p>Check out my youtube, I'll be posting a Devlog about the game very soon ;)<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw90yhJXRhN6W5ahGJtFQLQ<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T18:52:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d2/9d2fe6bf7bebe55a8da37a952c91a58c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Floky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
