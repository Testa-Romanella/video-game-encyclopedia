You will have to kill enemies, defend zones and activate switches to see how far you can go... But who will you choose to be? Happy, the magician, or Grumpy, the swordsman swordsball?</p>\n\n<p>Happy &amp; Grumpy is a game based on cooperation. Happy keeps the distance using his two spells,\u00a0Generic <strong>Purple</strong> Magic and The <strong>Gree</strong><strong>n</strong> Stunt. However, Grumpy gets closer to his enemies using his Mighty\u00a0<strong>Orange</strong> Sword and dropping <strong>Red</strong> Apple-Looking\u00a0Bombs. You can only hurt the enemies that match those colors, so you must cooperate if you want to stay alive!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are a small team of four students learning game development. Happy &amp; Grumpy\u00a0was made in 2 days for a\u00a0gamejam. They told us we had to do a game about symbionts, so we decided to make this minigame about cooperation.\u00a0 We are so happy about winning that gamejam, but even happier about having\u00a0created another game together. We are very passionate about what we do and we'd love to hear your opinion!<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>You can find us here!</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel free to email us at:\u00a0<strong><em>firsttrystudios@gmail.com</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/842/8422290a2affbd2e83a2c8eff68875d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["First Try Studios_"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
