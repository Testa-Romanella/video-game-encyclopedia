This game is action platformer, where after falling deeper, ever deeper into a cave, you finally manage to get your grounding, and try to escape. This leads to 5 levels of platforming madness, where armed with only a Jackhammer, you must escape!</p>\n<p>This game has 2 ways to play each level:</p>\n<p>Escape the Cave: Solve the platforming challenge, and move on to the next screen\u00a0</p>\n<p>Collect and Combo: Kill everything, drill everything, to gain gems and rack up a combo! These stats are shown when you die, and offer a nice sense of self-satisfaction (if this stuff self-satisfies you, otherwise you can just feel like the pro gamer you are), as well as giving a new harder twist on each level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 2 Major Bugs to be fixed:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>1. Screen shake just doesn\u2019t happen. At all. And it is supposed to</p>\n<p>2. Originally a rogue mode was planned, and I even got chunks and implementation for it done, but it was too buggy for me to launch the game with, so after fixing up its issues, I will release it, and deem this Jam Version complete</p>\n<p>THIS IS THE JAM VERSION OF JACKHAMMER JOE!\u00a0</p>\n<p>A mobile/steam version is planned to be released late 2021, with new areas, new enemies, new ores, and a base to explore + so much more!
