If you miss or use the incorrect phase colors you will die.</p><p>The aim of the game is to get to the exit (a glowing blue-white particle thing) while collecting coins and killing evil knights to increase your score.</p><p>Use the WASD keys to move forwards, left, back and right. Q and E turn you left and right. </p><p>To kill a knight you have to cast the correct spectral phases on your sword:</p><p>There are 3 phases and each phase can be a different color. Click a color chip under a phase name to charge the phase with that color.</p><p>Phases take a little time to charge. Make sure all phases you want to use are fully changed before you attack.</p><ul>\n<li>Phase 1 color should be the same as the color of the Knight's body.</li><li>Phase 2 color should be the same as the color of the Knight's shield if it has one.</li><li>Phase 3 color should be the same color as the aura/glow surrounding the Knight if it has one.</li></ul><p>You have to be right next to the Knight to hit it. </p><p>If the knight doesn't not have a shield or an aura, you don't have to set the phase 2 and 3 powers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/212c2b2b7794afd9209012cd5d8b55ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["kratorspore"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
