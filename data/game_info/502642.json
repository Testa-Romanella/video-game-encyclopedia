{"id": 502642, "slug": "r2dz", "name": "R2DZ", "name_original": "R2DZ", "description": "<p>This is R2DZ, a game where even enemies and bosses are randomly generated. Use randomly generated weapons and armor to explore a random dungeon with multiple distinct biomes.</p>\n<p>Features:<br/>- Up to 4 player co-op<br/>- Large variety of stats and special properties that define your weapons and armor. Find crazy combinations!<br/>- See an enemy using a crazy weapon? Kill, loot and use it yourself!<br/>- Large open randomized map that you can explore in any order you want. Enemies grow stronger as the bosses of each area are defeated, but so do you!<br/>- Every biome and every boss fight has its own song. There are some bangers out there.<br/>- It's not easy. With how different each run is, even I and all my playtesters are constantly facing new challenges.</p>\n<p>Release version 0.1 includes the first area, with 1 or 2 new areas planned. This first area includes an open, randomized map with\u00a06 distinct biomes,\u00a06 randomized boss fights and a final boss. And of course the features listed above.</p>\n<p>I am releasing this version now as I find it to be quite fun and very replayable. I hope to receive feedback that will help me polish the current experience and add requested features before moving on to adding brand new content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:46:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0da/0dab30b1f13f3f82925ab59ac01ffeee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Denhonator"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
