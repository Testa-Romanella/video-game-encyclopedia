All are the same from Project 3, there are no new added features.\u00a0When the user starts the app, by pressing the \u201cX\u201d on their keyboard the user can expect the menu of sliders and interactive color buttons to appear from the left side of the game screen. Before pressing the button \u201cX\u201d, the menu will appear then hide and wait for the user to choose whether or not to show or keep the menu hidden.\u00a0When the user presses the keyboard key \u201c1\u201d, both the time button and the live clock display rotate 60 degrees. If the user presses the keyboard key \u201c2\u201d the time button and the live clock display rotates 60 degrees and scales so that the prefabs look like they are bouncing. Finally, if the user presses the keyboard key \u201c3\u201d, the clock and the time button will stop rotating and bouncing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T10:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b17/b1786abea13b9c49574ea53e81bda09f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kripa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
