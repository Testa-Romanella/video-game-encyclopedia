(and maybe some red ones will give you back all your gauge...)</p>\n<p>You can play as long as you want, the levels are randomly generated in order of increasing difficulty among a number of 18 different paterns!</p>\n<p>Fr\u00e9quence is currently a toy in which it is impossible to lose, if your gauge is empty Fr\u00e9quence\u00a0will continue to move automatically in a sinusoidal way. In which case you can wait to pick up a collectible or start again. (Maybe one day we'll add a game over with a score...)<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>Fr\u00e9quence\u00a0\u00a0was carried out within the framework of a biannual project by :</p>\n<p><strong>Nathan Lebocq</strong> : Game &amp; Level Design<br/><strong>Damien Saenz</strong> : Programming<br/><strong>Thibault Hourcade Dit Belloc</strong> : Sound &amp; Game Design, Art Direction<br/><strong>Arthur Roels</strong> : Artistic Direction\u00a0<br/><br/>Music in menu is\u00a0EVA \u2013 \u5931\u671b\u3057\u305f<br/>Music in game is Synthwave F\u00a0by TeknoAXE's\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T05:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dd/5dd6cb408580d5fdf888674d637beca4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Nathan Lebocq"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
