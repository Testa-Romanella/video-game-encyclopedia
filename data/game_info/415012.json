The exit you use, and how you go about your escape,\u00a0is up to you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are many ways you can use the base gameplay mechanics in order to accomplish your goal. I encourage you to experiment with gameplay. Who knows, you may even figure out a strategy that no\u00a0one else has.</p>\n<p>This game was my first real dive into Unreal Engine, and was created as the last project during my final year in the\u00a0bachelor of motion design. I had one semester to put everything together, from pre production to a playable game. It was a lot of fun making this, and I hope you all enjoy playing it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:54:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11b/11b446bc2b4def2192e2b8ab9d695480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jaden T"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
