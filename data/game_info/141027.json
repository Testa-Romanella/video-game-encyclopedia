Instead of pixel art I used vector shapes this time around. I also made all of the music and sfx too. This was my first time using garage band and I guess making anything close to music to hopefully it sounds alright~</p>\n<p>The theme was \"running out of space\". The interpretation I went for was \"space\" being stars and such and not a physical/digital \"space\". So in the case of the game, you're \"running out of space\" as you fill the sky with constellations. <br/></p>\n<p>Everything was created during the jam! I hope you enjoy it!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li><strong>ART/PROGRAMMING/MUSIC/ETC:</strong> twitter.com/paigemarincak</li><li><strong>SPECIAL THANKS:\u00a0</strong>twitter.com/ciemarincak for helping me with the idea </li></ul>\r\nTechnical Stuff\r\n<ul><li><strong>ENGINE:</strong> GameMaker Studio 2</li><li><strong>ART:</strong> Photoshop</li><li><strong>MUSIC</strong>: Garage Band</li></ul>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<ul><li>Use the left mouse button to click and drag on stars to create constellations!</li><li>Constellations must have 3 stars or more!</li></ul>Scoring Guidelines\r\n<p>Your score is a combination of all of the scores of the constellations you have made. Each constellation gets points as follows:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10pts for each star<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10pts for each line<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0 2pts * 500 / distance of each line (i.e. shorter lines get more points)<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.1pts * the angle between two consecutive lines (i.e. the larger your angles the more points)<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10pts for each loop</p>\n<p>And from this total value, you lose 50pts for each star that could\u2019ve been in a constellation but wasn\u2019t.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d30/d3056551ca489573641cd1491378338b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Atemly Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
