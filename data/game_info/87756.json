Currently you have the option of launching 4 rocket models and visit 6 objects in space, such as the Hubble Telescope, International Space Station and Kepler.<br/><br/>I originally wrote this game for my 19 month old son to teach him about rockets &amp; space flight.  He was easily able to learn how to launch a rocket and control the camera within a few minutes. Although the controls are extremely simple even for a kid, adults that like rockets &amp; space explorations will find plenty of enjoyment in this simple yet fun space simulator.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:09:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe9/fe90cc916a9f547e60dc46126fe207c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Adam Berent"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Adam Berent"], "esrb_rating": null}
