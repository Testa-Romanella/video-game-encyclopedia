The elves have had enough, and want Santa to stop drinking and do his job. So the elves come up with a plan, they say to kill Santa and replace him with one of their own, so that Christmas will not be ruined by the current Santa. The elves gather their weapons and gang up on Santa trying to kill him, however, what they didn't realize is that Santa has his own weapon to fight back with...</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>The Naughty List is an action platformer-shooter game where you play as Santa Claus in the north pole. In The Naughty List, your main objective is to stay alive for as long as possible by using cover, rolling, grenades and your weapon to shoot and execute the infinite wave of elves. Santa's main abilities consist of rolling into cover, running and shooting, but he can also throw grenades to murder groups of elves; when rolling, Santa dodges oncoming bullets, but keep an eye on your stamina as it is depleted each time you roll. To gain stamina back you can stop rolling - you gain stamina back faster when standing still. When you roll into an enemy, they will trip over, which gives you a chance to execute them by pressing 'C' on your keyboard while standing over them. Santa's weapon of choice is an assault rifle which has 30 rounds and has a high fire rate to kill multiple elves. The elves however have a pistol which does a decent amount of damage but has a slow fire rate.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>UP/DOWN -\u00a0</strong>menu navigation<br/><strong>LEFT/RIGHT -\u00a0</strong>movement<br/><strong>SPACE -\u00a0</strong>reload<br/><strong>Z -\u00a0</strong>select (in menu)/fire weapon (hold)<br/><strong>X -\u00a0</strong>roll (to get in cover, press when near object)<br/><strong>C -\u00a0</strong>execute (when standing over tripped elf)<br/><strong>P -\u00a0</strong>pause</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Sprites by\u00a0Blue Yeti Studios<br/>Music by\u00a0greenRiverThriller<br/>Sounds provided by\u00a0freesound<br/>Inspired by\u00a0Not a Hero\u00a0and\u00a0Super Time Force Ultra</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41a14a60f56b5f1f5b4342bf1d4a387e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Yeti Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
