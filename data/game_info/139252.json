The objective is to set everything in the world (set in the player's apartment) back in its correct orientation. You cannot leave your apartment unless enough objects are fixed.</p><p>It may seem mysterious as to why the player must do these tasks, but if successful, it is revealed that this Groundhog Day-like time loop of obsessive ritual to fix everything in the apartment is a daily frustration to those suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).</p><p>The light-hearted approach with a groundhog lead character, and Bill Murray references is a hook to keep the player engaged and curious as to why one would take part in these challenges. The idea is empathy - to create and simulate hands on, what life with OCD can be like. Beyond a PSA, Groundhog Game is a Public Service Experience for awareness and a great cause.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45f9ff45dd334bcd1440704024f2028e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["PadenPierry"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
