While I was playing this game, I wondered what the game would be like with a Real-Time Combat. So, I have created a Game Design Document and Playable Prototype, for a real-time top down combat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: I have now made my life a bit easier, and created my own\u00a0(better) design templates, so the structure of these design docs are from my younger, less experienced self. But I will probably redo them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T06:09:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3e/d3ec35724abc7e7a459835233d2c0239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkTokayev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
