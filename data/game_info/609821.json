No relation to actual hacking.<br/></p><p>In this game, you control the \r\n'User' (the left side of screen) while enemy is on the right. You can\r\n Attack based on your STR, which deals damage to enemy's Shield and \r\nHealth. Shield stops a fixed percentage of damage; Health once 0 means you\r\nlose. Your Shield can be increased by Reinforce, which increases by RFS amount.\r\n Spamming Attack repeatedly will slow you down, while turtling behind \r\nshield won't help you win. Once time's up, its your loss. <br/></p>\n<p>You'll unlock \r\ntwo new skills at specific levels.\r\nStrengthen halves your shield and increases your attack strength. CounterHeal heals you if you time it just before enemy's Attack completes.<br/></p>\n<p>Press 'R' at the new game screen to Reset all level back to 0. <br/></p>\n<p>Hotkeys while in-game:</p>\n<p>Q - Reinforce<br/></p>\n<p>W - Attack</p>\n<p>A - CounterHeal</p>\n<p>S - Strengthen<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T09:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01ad80203d15072d10f8d0122e5ee217.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nropane"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
