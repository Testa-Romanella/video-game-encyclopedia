In the finished game you will control a fully physical, animated ragdoll T-Rex, free to explore the island's different zones and wildlife.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u201cForced to flee the nest as a baby dino, you find yourself at the bottom of a cliff, on a tropical island, lost and alone. Explore, evade, hunt and grow from baby to teen to adult T-Rex, able to shrug off spears and knock down trees with a flick of your tail. Play as a 100% physically animated character and interact with the environment as you explore this dinosaur life.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Who are we</strong><strong>?</strong></p>\n<p>We are Birdmask Studio. A brother and sister studio making\u00a0 short, experimental games,\u00a0 with the goal of developing one game every two months. We want you to see every stage of the games we make, from prototype, alpha, beta to final product. Developing games at this pace\u00a0 it\u2019s easy to get over focused on little details, so we hope by aiming to release frequently we can get everyone playing and telling us what's fun, what works, and what we should do more of.</p>\r\nNote the current\u00a0build is made only for a Gamepad controller, we will be working on mouse and keyboard controls during development.\r\n<p><strong>To follow us and get development\u00a0updates, check\u00a0out our;</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/BirdmaskStudio</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Blog:\u00a0https://www.birdmaskstudio.com/updates</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzdtmF-1xwfNW11RqQAjkFg</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T08:48:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99f74d82151e319b5317f733a09f0e05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BirdmaskStudio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
