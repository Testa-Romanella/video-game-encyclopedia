It was a fun learning experience.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>When bricks spawn they sometimes shoot out of the play area. Ran out of time to fix... yay physics</li><li>Kiryu will say \"nani\" even if you delivered the correct brick. Also ran out of time to finish and fix my for loop... whoopsie</li><li>Triggers are finnicky - give them a light tap instead of a firm press!</li><li>Game breaks when going back to menu after finishing :(</li></ul>\n<p>[REQUIRES CONTROLLER TO PLAY]</p>\n\n<p>In this minigame, Kiryu Kazuma gets into speed building LEGO models. Help him build a turtle and a plane model in record time!</p>\n\n<p>Features I would have liked to add:</p>\n<ul><li>Showing you which brick and how many you need for this step</li><li>Lives (for when wrong bricks are added)</li><li>Score based on time + accuracy</li></ul>\n<p>Yakuza\u00a9 is a property of SEGA</p><p>LEGO\u00a9 is a property of The LEGO Group.\u00a0</p><p>All rights reserved to their respective owners.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T03:57:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88b/88b1a373d45ad298159c3dadd55b0501.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PapaPolski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
