Overall I am satisfied with how those things turned out, despite the game being hardly fun to play.</p>\n<p>WAD to move. You can't move backwards.</p>\n<p>This is also my first solo Unity project uploaded to itch.io!</p>\n<p>Link to repository:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Lebyfochs/MiniJam99-FlyhtFall<br/></p>\n<p>This game was entered into Mini Jam 99.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T04:08:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d2c00d1e4add756f0b8233c22670f70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
