This app is very bloody and probably one of the silliest games on the AppStore !!!<br/><br/>Barney is a young, dynamic and very good-looking appendix. But he's continually harassed by the small and large intestines on account of his size. One day he's finally had enough - he's all worked up and suddenly decides to break free ...<br/><br/>... shortly afterwards in the operating room:<br/>His big moment has come at last. Barney's just left the lower abdomen and seen the light of day. The head doctor holds him proudly aloft for all to see. <br/><br/> ... and here you come into play ... <br/><br/>To make Barney's first steps into freedom as spectacular as possible, your mission is as follows:<br/><br/>Attempt to time his fall so he collides with the rapidly approaching rubbish bin lid. If you open the bin too soon or too late, Barney will either slam full speed on top of the rubbish bin or fall into the bin full of\u2026 \u2026eww \u2013 you can probably imagine.<br/><br/>1.) Wait till the doc's got Barney between his fingers <br/>     and is holding him to one side ready to throw.<br/><br/>2.) Tap the display once to make the doc push his leg <br/>      and let Barney fall.<br/><br/>3.) Barney now begins to fall without stopping.<br/><br/>4.) Tap a second time and try to get Barney to <br/>      hit the rubbish bin lid in mid-air. <br/><br/>5.) If you succeed, Barney will be flung towards freedom<br/>     in a huge arc.<br/><br/>6.) Packs of blood lie scattered across the floor. <br/>     If Barney lands on one, his flight takes longer.<br/><br/>Good luck to you and a good flight to Barney!!<br/><br/>This game is dedicated to my appendix Barney, who parted ways with me in December 1987 and has been kicking back in sunny Abuja / Nigeria ever since.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T16:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61a/61a6833c942d8940726c81fa7bbb5179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jan Essig"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Jan Essig"], "esrb_rating": null}
