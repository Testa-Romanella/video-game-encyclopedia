The game features five unique weapons, multiple enemy types, and a climactic boss fight at the end. It also contains a central\u00a0mechanic called the \"Bone-us Meter\", which drastically improves the player's current weapon for a short time. The game also features\u00a0perlin noise-based random level generation with preset enemy configurations mixed in.</p>\n\n<p>Likely the most striking aspect of this game is its visual design. Drawing inspiration from <em>Undertale</em> and <em>Downwell</em>, <em>Guns for Eyes</em> features hand-drawn, two-tone pixel art, a monochromatic color scheme, and a signature \"rotoscoping\" technique for all enemy and player designs. The game also features a variety of background decorations and particle effects for even more flair. A great deal of love and care has gone into the art assets in <em>Guns for Eyes</em>, giving it a truly unique appearance that stands out from the crowd.</p>\n<p>This game isn't finished just yet, look forward to updates soon.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys: Move</p>\n<p>Space Bar: Activate Bone-us Meter when full (fill by dealing damage)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T09:19:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9df7206a54e7000452268a7d0e4f0c32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CannedSmeef"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
