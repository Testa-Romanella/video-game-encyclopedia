However I kept running into bugs and glitches and dropped the project. After finishing Burger Quest I had enough knowledge on GBStudio 3.0 to fix most of the game breaking bugs. (Always make smaller projects to build up your skill set before tackling larger projects folks!) There are still some visual glitches like some defeated enemies leaving \"ghosts\" behind that you can't interact with, but as far as I know there's nothing that would prevent you from finishing the game.</p>\n<p>There's no music in the game because GBStudio crashes whenever I try to import anything to the project file. Just turn on your favorite adventure/JRPG tunes.<br/></p>\n\n<strong>CREDITS</strong>\n<p>The\u00a0player\u00a0character\u00a0was generated by 0x72's 2bit character creator.<br/>The NPCs are edited sprites of sprites made by the same creator.<br/>Everything else was made by me, MoistAmerica.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T12:08:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c8/7c8b8493e38209545c3bf17cc24582b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MoistAmerica"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
