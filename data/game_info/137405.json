Each player chooses their role (attacker, tank, healer), and draws gestures with their wands to summon offensive or defensive spells. Strategizing in the heat of battle is a must, as each role has unique abilities that will greatly benefit their team members. This project supports multiplatform players using both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift to connect and play together.<br/><br/>Note: On Oculus you can rotate your character using the right analog stick. On Vive you can do this by pressing the right controller's grip button, and tapping on the left or right side of the touchpad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e34b49d31aa357740cfa06257751e24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Spellcasters"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
