Play for an ancient god in a new hack &amp; slash adventure from an indie developer MadRock. Crush monsters, complete quests, find and destroy the source of evil. But what if it's not that simple?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time gods sent you here. You\u2019ve slept in a glass sarcophagus for hundrends of years. When people find themselves on the brink of extinction, you\u2019ll have to wake up. Now, the time has come. Get up and save the medieval village from the monsters coming from the abandoned dungeons!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEclipse is a mix of nostalgic hack &amp; slash games and sci-fi projects. The dynamics of modern games and a well-developed plot with elements of a detective story complement classic control mechanics.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe future is here! Use the weapons of the future in a medieval setting. Find out how technology fell into the hands of the people of that time!\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour skills and abilities are at the forefront, not the item statistics or the quality of the armor. To complete the game, you have to not only wield your axe or sword, but also use your brains: the dungeons are full of mysteries, secret passages and magic items.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nComplete quests, explore locations, or simply cut your way further down - in the end you\u2019ll find a secret, which you\u2019d prefer not to reveal.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSoundtrack from the game Eclipse.<br/>\nThe set contains 16 music tracks from the game in mp3 format\nTRACK LISTING\n<br/>\nDisc 1<br/>\n1.
