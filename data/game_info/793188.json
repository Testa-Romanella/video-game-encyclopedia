{"id": 793188, "slug": "holoshuffle", "name": "HoloShuffle", "name_original": "HoloShuffle", "description": "<p>Most important things first:</p>\n<ul><li>Hololive Member chibis by:\u00a0licialurie</li><li>Any persons officially associated with Hololive or Cover have complete permission to stream this game</li><li>Windows &amp; Android builds available</li></ul>\r\nWhat is this game?\r\n<p>HoloShuffle is a Hololive fan-made casual \"match-3\"\u00a0game. The gimmick being that you can move tokens anywhere you like, assuming it results in a match. Characters also have skills they activate based on that match. You can sort of think of this an a match-based RPG.</p>\r\n\"Disclaimers\"\r\n<ul><li>Team saves and stage scores are local right now</li><li>There is no stage clearance \"rewards\", and stages only have \"rank d\" version</li><li>There is no descriptions for what each stage's \"gimmick\" is. Included information at the bottom of this page.</li><li>There is no sound or music\u00a0\ud83e\udd37</li></ul>\r\nThere is little information in game, what does [x] mean?\r\n<strong><em>Matches &amp; Skill types</em></strong>\n<p>As mentioned above, when swapping\u00a0tokens on the board, they should result in a match. The type of match will trigger a corresponding skill, if that member has a sufficient skill (I hope to fill out complete skills for every member.. but there are gaps right now)</p>\n<ul><li>Solo Skill<br/>The swap results in a single match for either swapped token.</li><li>Duo Skill<br/>The swap results in a mutual match, where both tokens have a matching-duo skill.<br/>If the swap results in a mutual match, but members do not share a duo-skill, this will result in each token triggering their respective solo skills, should they exist.</li><li>Auto Skill<br/>These are matches that happen automatically during a combo.</li><li>Host Skill<br/>These are the most powerful skills, and trigger after the \"host\" meter fills.<br/>The first member in your team's lineup is your team's \"Host\", and each host skill has different requirements for charging.</li><li>Special Skills<br/>Some members have passives that change their behavior in specific ways. This can change the way they fall on the board, the way they match or even spawn.</li></ul>\n<em>Obstacles</em>\n<p>Obstacles are tokens that take up space on your board, and generally do not help you.</p>\n<ul><li>Rocks - Breaks from adjacent matches</li><li>Steel - Breaks after [5] actions</li><li>Gravel - Breaks after reaching the bottom of the board</li></ul>\n<em>Disruptions</em>\n<p>Your own members are not the only ones with skills. Stage targets (the \"enemy\")\u00a0also have skills called \"Disruptions\". When the target is casting their disruptions, you'll see a countdown timer next to them. Disruptions usually spawn Obstacles, or place debuff/effects on your tokens.</p>\n<strong><em>Effects</em></strong>\n<ul><li>Charmed -\u00a0tokens heal the target</li><li>Ice - Token cannot move, can match, but won't contribute to match's value. Breaks on match.</li><li>Paralyze - Prevents token from being matched</li><li>Sleep - Can match, but will deal no damage. Gains a power bonus if wakes up naturally after [x] turns</li><li>Doomed - Tokens turn in to an obstacle after [x] turns</li><li>Condemned - Token turns in to an obstacle on match.</li><li>Bushwhacked - Hides the token and prevents matches. Breaks on adjacent matches.</li><li>Concealed - Hides the token but allows matching. Disappears after [3] turns.</li></ul>\n<em>Elemental Damage &amp; Statuses</em>\n<p>Most members have specific damage types. There is no inherent bonus or resistances for elemental interactions. The exception is for statuses applied to the target:</p>\n<ul><li>Drenched - Increase all damage dealt</li><li>Burning - Deals damage every turn.</li></ul>\n<strong><em>Additional Information</em></strong>\n<p>Most effects and statuses can stack. Each stack increases their effectiveness, but not their duration.</p>\n<ul><li>Level 1 Drench lasting 1 turn, applied twice results in Level 2 Drench lasting 1 turn.</li><li>Level 1 Drench for 1 turn + Level 2 Drench for 2 Turns = Level 3 for 1 turn, then Level 2 for 1 remaining turn.</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Visual Effects</em></strong></p>\n<p>I'm still working out how to best visually display certain effects, for now:</p>\n<ul><li>Graphical, sprite/particle effects = <strong>debuff </strong>(example: charmed/frozen)</li><li>Outlines / Strobing effects = <strong>buffs </strong>(example: power/combo increase)</li><li>Color-coded blips attached to tokens = token invokes<strong> elemental status </strong>(example: red blip from\u00a0kiara imbuing allies to deal\u00a0burning damage)</li></ul>\n<strong><em>Stage Disruptions</em></strong>\n<p>I neglected to put information on each stage's disruptions, so here is a short list:</p>\n<ul><li>Sora: Charms tokens</li><li>Moona: Blocks tiles -- tokens become ineffective</li><li>Gura: Freezes tokens</li><li>Fubuki: Wolf-in-sheeps-clothes. Hides among your tokens</li><li>Ollie: Condemns tokens</li><li>AZKi: Paralyzes tokens</li><li>Subaru: Despite being adversaries, Subaru still grants your team POWER bonus</li><li>Fauna: Bushwhackes tokens</li><li>Matsuri: Blocks Host skill</li><li>Shion: Dooms tokens</li><li>Watame: Puts tokens to sleep</li><li>Ina: Ancient Ones take over some tiles</li><li>Kanata: Crushes boulder tokens, and takes their place</li><li>Marine: Starts with 1,700,000,000 health, every turn reduces her max health</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T18:30:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcb/bcbdf57265213eb7916efab6a9f703d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["RAB"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
