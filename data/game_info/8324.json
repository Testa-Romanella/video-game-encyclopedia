You can choose from a variety of rocket engines, fuel tanks, and other gizmos. You can even build rovers with powered wheels. <br/><br/><strong>EXPLORE</strong><br/>Blast off from any planet you want. You can fly through the intense atmosphere of Venus, or you can take advantage of the low gravity of Mercury. Whip around the sun and launch yourself out to the far reaches of the solar system.<br/><br/><strong>CHALLENGES</strong><br/>Several challenges are built into the game so you can have fun while learning about real rocket science. Challenge yourself to orbit with the least amount of fuel, land on the moon, and so much more.<br/><br/><strong>PERSISTENT SANDBOX</strong><br/>Build space stations, moon bases, refueling stations, and more with support for multiple launches. Save your sandbox at anytime or upload it and share it with your friends.<br/><br/><strong>ROCKET SCIENCE</strong><br/>Kepler wrote the equations 400 years ago, and SimpleRockets uses those equations to model extremely realistic orbital physics. Players will learn about rocket science and astrodynamics while they are having a blast exploring the solar system.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T02:08:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/145c8ac43f27c87acf283daf76b8448b.jpeg", "website": "http://jundroo.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 141, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jundroo"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jundroo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
