If you don't use Firefox I advise downloading the EXE file from bellow.\r\nIntroduction\r\nSanta Giftrun is the game I made for Discord Game Jam #3 in 2 days. It's a side scroller where you have to help Santa deliver gifts in time for everybody.\r\nHow to play\r\nThe controls are standard. You either choose SPACE and WASD or SPACE and ARROW KEYS. Space is used for dropping gifts, while the others are used for moving. Enjoy!\r\nCredits\r\nEverything except the music was made by me. The awesome music in the background is made by\u00a0Fatal Exit. Have a look. He's really good.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T02:12:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/355/355493648aefe44b46c70f7146c91bb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MaoItsMe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
