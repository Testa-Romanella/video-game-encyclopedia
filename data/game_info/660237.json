This adventure includes cameos from tons of Jaboody characters and memes that come to life in this short game designed to make you giggle.</p>\n<p>This purchase only includes the game boy rom file. you will have to download a game boy emulator for it to work. This is a beta version of the game. if you purchase this version of the game you will later receive the full version ROM file. this is NOT the cartridge version which will be released in the future.\u00a0 money put towards this preorder will go towards making the game longer with more battles, and hopefully even music. thank you for checking out my game page.
