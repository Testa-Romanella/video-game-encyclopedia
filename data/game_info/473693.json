No, not those video calls where you drink alone in your living room, parties! Where you would stagger between rooms singing along to songs that you don't know the words to, wondering if the next person you accidentally spill your drink on could be THE ONE!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWell now you can recreate all of your favourite times from almost forgotten \"Old World Parties\" with the ANALOG PARTY SIM! Become the Host of the party, make sure your guests have a good time, enjoy the music and walk the line between being the right amount of drunk and drinking so much that they have their (now ex-) Partner's 83 year old Grandmother in a headlock while saying how happy they were to be invited... (That's a true story).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay through three difficulty modes or try your hand at the Endless Mode, where you attempt to keep the party going forever!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game started out as my submission to Ludum Dare 46, and excluding the particle effects and sound effects, was a completely solo effort. I hope you like it!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't party Digital, party Analog (Digitally).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T00:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/492/492b1342e5b4887094b85eef4f0e3a8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HyperBabyDuck", "Harry Forde"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Harry Forde"], "esrb_rating": null}
