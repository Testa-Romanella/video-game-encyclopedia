The way we aim to do this is with a \u201cshow, don't tell\u201d approach to explaining the mechanics and using more abstract metaphors &amp; magic over pseudoscience to explain the universe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Different realities will have their own lore and issues, so the player can explore all these different worlds while still knowing it all adds up to major plot points, which should keep the player engaged. This also allows for us to make major environmental changes when things start to look stale with in-universe explanations.</p>\n<p>[Very much a WIP - above is the current \"sales\" copy for the game which needs as much work as the game does right now. Currently 2 working classes in-game with 2 basic zones to show the premise. More classes and content are on the way!]\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T17:44:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b90/b90986cd56806ce078b60a912ba589d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Candy Crab Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
