Meet a cast of interesting characters, each with their own opinions about the return of magic, and decide for yourself: allow magic to fall into the wrong hands or\u00a0seal away the power of the magical aspects for good?</p>\n<p>Evergold is in early development and therefore is unfinished. During this open testing time any feedback is appreciated. If you want to support the development of Evergold further consider filling out this feedback form\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>Important Version 0.0.1 Information: Press Space Bar twice\u00a0to skip the intro and F4 to toggle fullscreen.
