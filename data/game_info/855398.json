Most of what I learned was how to navigate a game jam like Ludum Dare.  When I deployed the project, I simply uploaded a .zip with the executable and needed files.  Turns out this is not the best way to submit for a game jam.  Instead, I should I submitted a web playable version of the game as I have done here.  This was my first time implementing artificial intelligence into a game though.  What we have here is a simple finite-state-machine controlling the aliens and turrets.  I wrote the machine to be flexible and move from one entity to another seamlessly.  In fact, the state machine code is unchanged from the alien to the turret.  I made nodes that were the states that inherited the generic state object that the state machine referenced, making use of Godot's nodes in a seemingly smart manner.\r\n<br/>\r\nThis state machine was also the source of most of my bugs. \r\n Some of them still present, after I fixed the game ending bugs.</p>\r\nConclusion\r\n<p>I would not recommend playing the game, it is that bad.  It is good for me to look back at it though and remember where I was.  This is, after all, the second game I ever \"completed\".  I am afraid the first title is likely lost to time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T13:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97e/97e37f121f16b4c2cbe092bd4671f90e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maindric"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
