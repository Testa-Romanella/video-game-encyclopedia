It is still very much in development. It's a first person shooter game that you can play with your friends, where there are gamemodes such as Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill, and Free-For-All. I plan on adding several more gamemodes in the future, such as Capture the Flag, Infection, and a Story Mode. I plan to release more games in the future.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in helping us make this game, will it be bug reporting or play testing, join our Discord!\r\n</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/D74VbvXe5F\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\"P\" - die</p>\n<p>\".\" - Switch Teams</p>\n<p>\"Middle-Click\" - Throw Grenade</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:30:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/415/415501e4999ed39c54b4fa1239c44bff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erroneous"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
