You have no idea what it wants, all you know is that every time you look away, even for just a second... it gets closer...</p>\n<p><strong>--------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>Over Then Under is a psychological horror game for PC VR that focuses on making the player really, really uncomfortable by putting them into a very distressing and dark situation.</p>\n<p>Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's\u00a0\u00a0\"The Beast in the Cave\", you have a limited amount of torch light remaining to escape before you're cast into darkness. You have 5 minutes of light and each minute, the light grows dimmer.</p>\n<p>Similar to the \"Weeping Angels\" from Dr. Who, creatures move towards you when you're not looking at them... at an unsettling speed. It makes it difficult to be careful that something isn't sneaking up on you from behind... &gt;:)</p>\n<p>Each playthrough is slightly different, with a variety of locations the exit can be and different chances\u00a0 and locations\u00a0for creatures\u00a0to spawn.</p>\n<p>Includes my own terrible voice-acting.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><em>There was a lot I didn't have time to add, so I'll continue to update this with a few more planned updates. Including, but not limited to:</em><em>\u00a0footstep SFX, additional levels/objectives, more enemy types/behaviors and hand animations.</em></p>\n<p><em>I will write up a post-mortem as well, as the original scope of this game was intended to be MUCH larger (I feature-creeped myself, so I had to backtrack and come up with a new design in the 11th hour. Fun times!)</em></p>\n<p><strong>----------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Audio</p>\n<p>\"Tired of life\" by Meyd\u00e4n<br/></p>\n<p>https://linktr.ee/meydan</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p>Creative Commons CC BY 4.0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Art</p>\n<p>Fantasy Airship - Sean Dachtler (UE Marketplace)<br/></p>\n<p>Dynamic Volumetric Sky - BoranOzturk (UE Marketplace)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T11:04:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c30/c305e361b3a82faae6e584a1192fbf40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robot Punch"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
