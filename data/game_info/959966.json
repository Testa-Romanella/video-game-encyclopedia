For this reason, we really appreciate constructive feedback that can help us improve.<br/><br/>Please expect to find in this game a small, simple, arcade-style, casual, challenging, and replayable scoring game. The goal is to beat your previous record, unlock skills to go further and further, and compete for the best score worldwide.<br/><br/>As it is a simple game, we have prepared a Demo version where you can learn and enjoy most of the available mechanics. If you feel like seeing everything, showing off your skills in the world ranking, or simply supporting us to continue with future projects, you can contribute by purchasing the full version.<br/><br/>We have tried to add some extra modes that we hope you will really enjoy.<h3>Other features and accessibility</h3><br/><strong>Easy or difficult?</strong> We have tried to make a game with mechanics that are easy to understand and remember so that everyone can enjoy it. But we have also made sure that difficulty is a determining factor in progressing. We hope that the skills you acquire will allow everyone to achieve their own balance where they feel comfortable and have fun participating in the challenge!<br/><br/><strong>Colorblind mode</strong>: We know that the game mechanics require distinguishable color palettes, so we have included a modified color mode for colorblind people that can be activated in the settings. Unfortunately, we cannot verify its effectiveness, but we hope that everyone who wants to can enjoy the game. If you want us to improve any aspect of accessibility, you can also leave us a comment.<br/><br/><strong>Languages</strong>: We want the game to be accessible to everyone, so this page and part of the game content have been translated using an automatic translator.
