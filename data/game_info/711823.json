However, when it\u2019s the week of Christmas and everyone is running around to meet deadlines, even the best of workplaces can get things mixed up.</em></p>\n<p><em>In this case, a few tags fell off of some of the gifts while being transferred to Santa\u2019s sleigh! Each of you is the head of a different department. Since each of you has handled the gifts at one point in the process, you have a few clues from your department about which ones belong to whom!</em></p>\n<p><em>The only way to solve the mystery is to share some of your information. However, you and the others want a promotion to the coveted position of Santa's Little Helper. Build up points, piece together the clues, and get ready to make a guess!</em></p>\n<p>Gift Scramble is a semi-cooperative, deductive reasoning game with limited information, for 3 or more players. If the clues you share don\u2019t reveal much, you\u2019ll be left sweeping out the reindeer stables. If you reveal too much too soon though, you\u2019ll be left in the cold as the others make their guesses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find the right balance of information to offer, make your guesses at the right time, and you\u2019ll earn the title Santa\u2019s Little Helper by Christmas!</p>\n<p>Gift Scramble is a part of the Holiday TTRPG Jam.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\u201cIt sounds fun and like it would lead to a hilarious and entertaining experience!\u201d</em>\u00a0<br/>~ Eliot Silvarian</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cI could see a parent playing it with their kids, a family playing together, or just adults doing it, and all of those groups having equal fun.\u201d</em> <br/>~ Beth</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cIt has a great theme and could be great for long-time players or newbies.\u201d <br/></em>~ C.
