Not written in actual Sierra AGI, but with the same kind of blocky low-res style of artwork in all the 16 glorious EGA colours.</p>\n<p>You play as Agent N of the HCA (Highly Clandestine Agency) and are on a mission to infiltrate Spectrum Enterprises' corporate HQ to find out what nefarious scheme they are about to unleash on an unsuspecting world. Or have they perhaps already done so?</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>In the style of the old text adventure games and early graphic adventures, you type commands for the protagonist to carry out. Just start typing, and hit enter when done. The first command you'll have to type in this game is simply get out of car</p>\n<p>Move Agent N around with the cursor keys. Like Sierra did, a single keypress for one of the arrow keys will start the character walking in that direction. You can also walk diagonally with the home, end, page up and page down keys (which will make a lot more sense if you see their positions on the numeric keypad of a full-size keyboard). Pressing the same direction arrow again when the character is already moving in that direction will stop him walking, as will the 5 on the numeric keypad (numlock should be off for that to work). <em>Do not hold down the arrow keys</em> as it will simply stop/start the movement several times a second, leading to jerky animation and movement.</p>\n<p>Other useful keys:</p>\n<ul><li>Esc brings up the game menu\r\n</li><li>F1 shows a help screen\r\n</li><li>F2 toggles sound\r\n</li><li>F5 saves the current game\r\n</li><li>F7 restores a saved game\r\n</li><li>Tab shows the list of items you are currently carrying\r\n</li><li>Alt-Z or Ctrl-Q quits the game\r\n</li></ul>\r\nNeed a hint?\r\n<p>I've tried to make this game as fair as possible and to make sure that clues are provided through careful exploration and reading the description. Still, text parser games can be a little daunting for those who aren't accustomed to them.
