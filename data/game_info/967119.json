{"id": 967119, "slug": "verdict-descent", "name": "Verdict: Descent", "name_original": "Verdict: Descent", "description": "<h3>Roleplay Focus</h3>This game has a critical focus on roleplay &amp; collaborative writing. If you aren't a fan of serious writing, it probably won't be for you!<br/><br/><br/>Write out a story collaboratively with dozens of other players in a living, breathing world. Every action you make influences the course of history, shaping your character's life for better or worse.<br/><br/>Fight, craft, explore &amp; more in this writing-focused MMORPG.<br/><br/><h3>Expansive World</h3>Verdict hinges on its ability to immerse you in a story of your own creation. To help with this, we have a sprawling map filled with numerous biomes, dynamic weather, a fully-fleshed out city to represent Galvia, and even underground caverns, ruins, and more to be explored.<br/><br/><br/>Depicted above is Hollow Peak, a prison embedded in the side of the highest mountain in Astraea. Frigid and unfeeling, it's a sharp contrast to the lush world beside it.<br/><br/><h3>Deep Mechanics</h3>To facilitate your character truly feeling like <strong>your</strong> character, Verdict has 15+ unique spell trees, a variety of levelable skills, six Courts to pick from, and a variety of other, less-obvious features waiting to be discovered.<br/><br/>Because the game revolves around roleplay, you access these parts of the game via writing with other players. In other words, you can go as far as your story carries you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T03:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13e/13ea7ce012a38e8c1061ffc4977567bc.jpg", "website": "https://main.verdict.dev/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Godscape"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Godscape"], "esrb_rating": null}
