Keep your blocks from piling up by strategically placing them across 5 backgrounds complete with individual storylines. With special interactive stages and creatures, and classic tile-based gameplay, <em>Pit Blocks 3D</em>\u00a0will keep you coming back for more.</p>\r\nKey Points\r\n<ul><li>Choose from 3 different game modes: Basic, Advanced and Expert \u2013 each with different brick sizes.</li><li>Enjoy beautiful environments with their own unique stories.</li><li>Opt for specific pit sizes or select a random one.</li><li>Jam to a large selection of soundtrack themes including Retro, Heavy Metal, and Piano!</li><li>Earn more than 20,000 achievements.</li></ul>\n<p>Each environment in Pit Blocks 3D features a limited storyline that sets the mood. Some environments even have enemies and/or bosses.</p>\n<p><em>Solar System:</em>\u00a0The Solar System is one of the easiest environments to play through. As part of a galactic exploration party, you begin the level by viewing the Solar System from afar \u2013 under the instructions of your Captain, Keen. The mood is set, and the adventure\u00a0 begins. Once hyper-spacing over to Neptune, you can start playing and place the incoming bricks. After\u00a0 battling through 5 levels of cube-matching frenzy, you travel to planet Earth. At this stage, there is a short intermission before you continue on to your journey to map the Solar System \u2013 reaching the Sun at level 9.</p>\n<p><em>Painted Forest:</em> The main challenge is time. Upon entering this level, you're greeted by a Green Dragon and fish swimming in a pond. As a treasure hunter sent by Her Royal Highness, you're searching for the lost treasure of the Great Warrior Red Shield. Once reaching level 8, you learn of twin bears who are guarding the secret treasure. You must chase them away and reach level 9 to open the chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Fantasy:</em> Our mages brought us grave news! The Leviathan is about to wreak havoc upon the peaceful Fantasy Nation! You must destroy him before he rises. You must face two bosses: the henchman Troll and the Leviathan. Upon defeating the Leviathan, you can continue playing to infinity and beyond, standing over the defeated Leviathan.</p>\n<p><em>Ice Cave:</em> The ice elemental minions will shoot ice missiles at you \u2013 and if they pass too close to the camera, it shakes. The ice missiles might also blow up or get up in your face, which will increase the difficulty level. You can always dodge these by moving the camera around.</p>\n<p><em>Volcano:</em> This environment is the most difficult of all environments, mainly due to its Level 8 artillery barrage of fire against the player by the volcano\u2019s fire minions. This is one environment where the player can fight back, however. The final level of the environment, level 10, is a face to face encounter with a fire dragon... a lava dragon... a magma dragon... a hot dragon! The player must beat this level in order to win the environment and earn their achievement.</p>\r\nDemo\r\n<p>Demo is available here! Demo features:</p>\n<ul><li>Unlimited gameplay</li><li>Solar Environment, Planet Earth only</li><li>Advanced Mode only</li><li>Locked-in playfield of 6 x 7 x 6</li><li>Single Retro soundtrack</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Requirements</em>:</strong>\u00a0The demo is not graphically optimized, which means it will utilize some more of your GPU than the optimized final version of the game. Most video cards hit 60-90FPs in this demo, however, so play should still be smooth. The demo also requires about 300-400MBs of RAM (0.3-0.4GBs).</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0The demo does not support gamepads/controllers. However, the final version of the game does. The demo is an early rendition of the game and is meant to only outline gameplay. It has some known bugs that have long been found and fixed, although you should still find the play enjoyable and uninterrupted.<br/></p>\n<p>Offiical website<br/></p>\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>\u00a0Intel Core i5</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>\u00a04GB</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>\u00a0Intel HD Graphics 4000 or equivalent</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong>\u00a010 (shader model 4.0)</li><li><strong>Hard drive:</strong>\u00a03.5 GB</li></ul>\r\nRecommended Requirements\r\n<ul><li><strong>OS:</strong>\u00a0Windows 10</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>\u00a0Intel Core i7</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>\u00a08GB</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>\u00a0GTX 760 / equivalent, or above</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong>\u00a011</li><li><strong>Hard drive:</strong>\u00a03.5\u00a0GB</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/499/4998064e90ee472373b82abb0f205ebe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SRM Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
