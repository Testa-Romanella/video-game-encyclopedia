Note that your mood is affected by your behavior and the behavior of others, and that this sometimes influences which conversation options are available to you. It is likely worthwhile to play the game more than once.<br/></p><p>Thanks for trying out <em>Smitten Kittens!</em></p><p><em>UPDATE, AUG 2016 - </em>Apologies, but at this time I do not intend to carry on development of this game. I learned some good stuff making it, and intend to redirect that learning and my energy into my main Work In Progress.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee8/ee810f9d758dd0f6bc90a6fbfb53e71d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["isquiesque"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
