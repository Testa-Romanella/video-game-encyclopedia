Although there weren't juicy menus or interesting character models, the game played out correctly and felt fun on a gameplay level. The Warehouse Heist was a major level design improvement from what we had made before. This week was all about juice and theming. While the mechanics of the game were there, nothing really drew the eyes of the player, either on a UI level or a gameplay level. We implemented the following changes to help combat this.</p>\n<p>\r\nJuice added for Menus:</p>\n<p>Menus now fade in and out from each other. Colors and background images have been changed as well, including more interesting buttons. Still need a defined color theme here, but the juice is there.\r\nThe dialogue system is much less intrusive: The dialogue system is now quicker and much easier to skip through. We moved it to the top of the screen and made dialogue lines much shorter/less frequent.</p>\n<p>\r\nHeist0 (now \"Prison Break\") has been changed:</p>\n<p>We've added a much more juicy theme for the training/tutorial level. We also are looking to move away from the idea of a \"tutorial,\" and more into the idea of a starter/easier level. Because we can only expect people to play our game for around 10-15 minutes, we have to make it more succinct. This means no in-depth tutorials.</p>\n<p>\r\nTraining levels:</p>\n<p>Past levels can now be accessed from the \"training\" menu once they have been \"unlocked\" (played before).\r\nLevel design fixes and theming for Heist1:Heist1 (\"Warehouse Job\") now has some bugfixes (being able to run between close guards, run through stairs). Doors now appear more like actual doors. The Player now has to \"steal\" the dossier and leave without being detected by picking it up.</p>\n<p>\r\nUI Juicing:</p>\n<p>The timer bar is now thicker and more apparent. More icons have been added during the planning stage as well. Trap range indicators are more dynamic as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T06:44:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66ef0f9266abdac8dd066d3989d27fde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DeluxeCatPack"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
