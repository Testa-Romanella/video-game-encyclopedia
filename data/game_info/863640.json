I squished as many as I could, but I'm 100% certain there's some I've missed. Do point it out if you find some.</p>\n<p>If you happen to find yourself stuck on a tree, you can fast travel back to the village in the map if you're not aggroed. Also, save regularly!</p>\n<p>Other than that\u00a0though, have fun!</p>\n\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0@MastahPie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T22:43:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f6/0f6f31af96a18920ff8d388bddf5ea8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PieMastah"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
