Storytelling was for me synonymous with games that should be considered as pieces of art...</p>\n<p>However, when I started programming and developping video games, I realised that\u00a0\u00a0technicality\u00a0 is import too, and that's sometimes even more important than storytelling! That's why I started improving my games mechanics, and today I'm presenting this demo to you, a demo that offers:<br/></p>\n<p>-A fair amount of difficulty</p>\n<p>-Nostalgia towards old arcade games</p>\n<p>-Freezing time mechanic</p>\n<p>-Random enemies generation mechanic</p>\n<p>-A unique combat system mechanic where you have only one bar that stands for health and energy</p>\n<p>The main goal of this demo is to test this combat system and to improve it in the future.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T11:42:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/733/733a3d84cac5ee38b03cdef3449ec031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Daemon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
