Try out the first level filled with dominos, ramps, and more, but watch out as you progress. As you pass levels the speed of the ball increases while the obstacles become thinner, longer, and more recurrent\u2014ultimately just harder. Although easy to conceptualize, playing the game requires calculation and agility at some points and nothing but speed at others. It's hard, but beatable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T17:27:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/757/757eea3f8c43c0f0d0dd29bdfe4eade4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["oam114"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
