It's only a demo, which explains a few selections.\u00a0If you made the original game (Danganronpa) and want me to take it down, let me know! You can sadly only generate one text bubble, and you can't make mp4s. For now, record your trials on your device, and clip them together using an editor. I'd recommend OBS.\u00a0Now, I hope you enjoy this generator!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T13:19:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cef78a071033cf2088f604995a9c1546.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scraptor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
