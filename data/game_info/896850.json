Norwich, Greg W. Narotski<br/></p>\r\nGame Summary:\r\n<p>You are a pilot of an experimental scout spaceship and was testing a new engine that caused the ship to go into an alternate asteroid dimension that has ghost asteroids flying through it. You must navigate your way through the maze, looking for the key to escaping the dimension, and once found you need to find a specific location in the maze that is clear enough for you to warp back to Earth.\u00a0</p>\r\nGame Outline:\r\n<p>Trapped in an alien asteroid, you must navigate a maze-like cave. In order to escape, you must find the key, then go to the exit gate. Watch out, asteroids are flying all around and you have limited fuel.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Navigate a maze with space drift</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Asteroids float around maze, shoot to blast them\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fuel limit, asteroids give fuel on destroy\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maze is procedurally generated\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Asteroids break into smaller asteroids\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grab key, then win at exit gate\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Player has 3 Lives to navigate maze</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 W\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  - Thrust forward\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A/D \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Rotate ship</p>\n<p>\r\n  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SPACE - Fire laser</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ENTER- Start Game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T07:12:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19c/19cf79f1ab693de95d690cd7e1cbc301.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CSCC Mini-Projects"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
