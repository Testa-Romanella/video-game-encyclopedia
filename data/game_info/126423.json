It's an rpg that let's go some of the game mechanics of other rpgs, here you can't change equipment aside a gem, it doesn't have a world map, you only control 3 main characters, each unique. This game contains scripts from Galv, Yanflly, Pacman and KilloZapit. The title screen music is Bard Song (Karaoke), and one in-game is Phantasy Star Universe Hogosha OC ReMix.  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b6/0b6032266f19bec89e20cf4a21f55c8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RicJFNas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
