At that point I only had ideas and my own resources to go off, but now I'm actually making stuff! Wowee! Crap aside, this is what I'd like to call a Speedrun esc game, with each level being a minilevel and you needing to clear it as fast as you can. There will be individual goals for each stage, though, so it wont be TOO pointless. Thinking about adding an intro cut scene, but don't know if i want to go that far yet. Also, HEAVILY based off of smb3, so if you see any likeness, that's why. feel free to debug this as much as you want, critique is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00a/00a712a90ea3a370bcd3606780a34d07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathan_R"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
