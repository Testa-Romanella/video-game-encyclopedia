The more parrot followers you have the more powerful your squawk is but, be careful you will also move slower when squawking with more followers.</p>\n<p>Super happy with how this turned out, I did the programming and art and music was acquired under CC0 from here. Thank you so much for playing, this is my first game on this account :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:02:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7ef19a1f33bb19486c5c8bcc32e4d74c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tonicwater"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
