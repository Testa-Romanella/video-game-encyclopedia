The <strong>STR (Stirred Tank Reactor)</strong> is one of the most prevalent types of bioreactor and the continuous mode of operation is applied in many areas, ranging from wastewater treatment to the production of pharmaceuticals.</p>\n<p>Present <strong>software</strong> consists of an interactive <strong>CSTR (Continuous STR)</strong> model, developed for <strong>educational</strong> purposes. This model represents a perfectly mixed system, where aerobic cells in suspension <strong>(X)</strong> convert a substrate <strong>(S)</strong> into a product <strong>(P)</strong>.</p><p>Three process variables can be monitored and controlled <strong>(T, pH and O2)</strong>. These variables impact the process significantly and are also significantly impacted by the process, resulting in a complex of intertwined <strong>feedback</strong> loops.</p>\n<p>Simulations can be carried both in <strong>batch</strong> and <strong>continuous</strong> modes.</p><p>The <strong>instantaneous</strong> output of the reaction dynamics with <strong>real-time</strong> input controls offer an intuitive display of the <strong>effects</strong> of variables over the process and the <strong>interactions</strong> between variables.</p><p>Teachers may use it live in the <strong>classroom</strong> or assign <strong>home</strong> activities using this tool. It was not designed for direct research or engineering applications, but rather for helping in the formation of researchers and engineers in <strong>graduation courses</strong>.</p><p>Hope it is <strong>useful</strong>.\u00a0Feedback is <strong>welcome</strong>.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T06:20:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/541437e6d292c5da41569f1bd5cb7204.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fliperama"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
