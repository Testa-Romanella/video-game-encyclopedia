You have been dropped in a training area, surrounded by a handful of buildings. I trust you know what to do...</p>\n<p>Walking can be difficult, turning is even harder. You can only operate two limbs at a time, so choose wisely.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>There is no way to readjust your VR play space yet. It should still be playable in relatively small rooms, as long as you can reach the controls.</li><li>Controls are currently placeholder assets, but grab the untextured blocks and see what happens.</li><li>Locomotion of your mech is physics-driven. Mimic a walk cycle to walk, lifting each foot in turn and placing it ahead of your last step. In order to turn, you have to rotate your feet. If you rotate a foot while it's the only one on the ground, your mech will rotate in the opposite direction. It takes some getting\u00a0used\u00a0to.</li><li>The game was developed on the Index, but should work on any SteamVR-compatible headset.\u00a0If you are using the Vive, I recommend downloading StompingGround_post-deadline. The on-time build only has grip controls, which are a bit uncomfortable to use on Vive.</li><li>No HUD or menus yet. Alt-F4 to quit the game. Sorry.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:29:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0dbe855ebf5c4a4b50a4d28fd019376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["josef01"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
