Buy low, sell high. What's cheap in one city may be expensive in another. <br/><br/>You\u2019ll need to fund your operations by borrowing money. But be careful, the cost of borrowing in this world can be very high so you'll need to know the cost of goods to keep ahead of those interest charges\u2026<br/><br/>To make progress you'll need to aim high. Borrow as much as you can get but only when you know what you\u2019re going to buy and that you're getting a good price. The interest rates are non negotiable and the penalties are harsh. <br/><br/>And by the way the Interpol is after you. There\u2019s nothing you can do about that, that\u2019s the cost of doing business.<br/><br/>---------------------------------<br/><br/>Thought a look behind the scenes might interest some of you.
