Piloting Mars rovers gone rogue, you\u2019ll race against the clock (or compete against your friends) to break open boulders to collect the most important geological specimens and power boosts to use on your rover or against your opponents. Watch out for that astronaut!\r\n</p>\n<strong>The Facts Behind the Game</strong>\n<p>The gameplay, and the general look of the Rovers themselves,\u00a0was inspired by the\u00a0Mars Science Laboratory\u00a0mission, which saw the\u00a0Curiosity\u00a0rover land on the surface of Mars back in 2012. Still going strong today,\u00a0Curiosity\u00a0landed inside the large\u00a0Gale crater\u00a0near Mars\u2019 equator, which was a site that NASA believed would be a good place to carry out Curiosity\u2019s mission:\u00a0to look for signs of water and signs of life (both past or present), and to assess the climate and geology of Mars.\r\n</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<em>Rogue Rovers</em>, as in real life, evidence of\u00a0sedimentary rocks\u00a0and\u00a0mineral salts\u00a0that can only form in the presence of water are extremely valuable for understanding the Red Planet's watery past.\r\n</p>\n<strong>The ROM Connection</strong>\n<p>Scientists at the ROM actively study Mars, from right here on Earth! The ROM has one of the\u00a0most important collections of Martian meteorite samples\u00a0in the world.\u00a0These are rocks which were formed on Mars, then\u00a0blasted off of Mars by massive asteroid impacts. Eventually, they\u00a0found their way to Earth and into the hands of scientists. The study of Martian meteorites by ROM scientists has helped solve some long standing mysteries about Mars,\u00a0such as how long ago its volcanoes were still erupting, giving scientists important insight into the Red Planet\u2019s history!\r\n</p>\n<strong>What's a Game Jam?</strong>\n<p>At a ROM Game Jam, teams of developers spend a weekend at the ROM learning from collections and curators\u00a0and using\u00a0those ideas to build fun games inspired by the museum. \u00a0With only two days to research and create their games, the results can be weird, wacky, and downright wonderful!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:01:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/924bcbb9775d28dbc8074a91324c55b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROM Learning"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
