I have a rebuilt version in the works, for more information checkout http://snowdrama.net for project updates!</p><p><strong>Installation</strong></p><p><strong>For Windows PC players: </strong>Download the PC version below and unRar it with a program like WinRAR or 7Zip into a folder. Then just double Click PuzzleRings.jar and the application should run.</p><p><strong>For Android Players: </strong>Currently the only option is to download the APK file and move it to your device then install it by taping it from a file utility, like Astro File Manager. You will also need to allow apps from unknown sources in the security part of your settings. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/343/34344cbdb06fd70c17fd08ac00136a83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snowdrama"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
