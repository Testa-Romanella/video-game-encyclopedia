All character art belongs to Katterbox.\u00a0Backgrounds, music and sounds are not owned by Katterbox, the individual licenses can be found via links within the game's 'about' page or in the README document provided with the game.</p>\n<p>This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the author\u2019s imagination or are used fictitiously.<br/>Any resemblance to actual events or locales, persons or corgis, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.</p>\n<p>The was made for the June 2017 \"Corgi Jam\" game jam. Below the summary is a list of things to be expected with a full game release.<br/></p>\n<p>----------------------------</p>\r\nSummary\r\n<p>The object of the game is to (as you may guess) adopt a corgi! The game features six corgis with different 'stereotypical' personalities from animes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Meet the optimistic Dere, the abrasive Tsun, the weeaboo Hine, the royal Hime, the unbiased Kuu and last but certainly not least, the \"loving\" Yan. For those of you who know your anime stereotypes, you may already guess what they are like. ;3 For those of you who don't, jump on in and find out.</p>\n<p>The simplistic stylings of the game feature mainly 'visual novel' type gameplay in which the player interacts with dialogue choices. The player can choose which dog they wish to adopt but their favorite dog may not choose the player!\u00a0Your choices may matter so choose what you say carefully!</p>\n<p>----------------------------</p>\n<p>The game is a demo since it was made for the game jam. If enough people like the game and want a full version with all 7 days, comment below and let me know. However, keep in mind that I will most likely want to charge $5 for a full game considering the time, effort and assets I would pour into it.</p>\n<strong>Full game features <em>may</em> include:</strong>\n<ul><li>Fully drawn backgrounds</li><li>More character expressions</li><li>Seven days of gameplay (including demo days)</li><li>Higher variety of sounds and music</li><li>Possibility of voice acting</li><li>Possible 'art gallery' feature</li><li>Unique ending art for each ending</li><li>Unique event art featuring special occurrences or your favorite dogs</li><li>More dogs</li><li>More outfits for the current dogs</li><li>and more~</li></ul>\n<p>I have a PC and did not have the means to test the mac version. If there is an issue, I may or may not be able to resolve it. This is technically my first game ever so if there is anything I can do better, let me know in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/ded2c448e6ec63a00a5825516bce4ab6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Katterbox"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
