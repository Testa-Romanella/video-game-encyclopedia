In the first, you roll your dice. In the second, you use the results to move your character closer to the goal. However, every dice you roll stays in the box, ready to give you their effects.</p>\n\n<p>The Dice</p>\n<p>Your very own sparkly character!</p>\n\n<p>Your less generic than usual number dice!<br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Your shiny directional dice!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The soon to be yours goal!</p>\n\n\n<p>And finally, a squeaky-clean ground! (I mean, just look at those stars)<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Roll them all within <em>the box</em>, a delicate frame that will serve as your map in an adventure that will let you reeling (or should I say, <em>rolling</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- Vexteezy for multiple textures\u00a0<a free-vector=\"\" galaxy\"=\"\" href=\"&lt;a href=\" https:=\"\" www.vecteezy.com=\"\">Galaxy\" class=\"redactor-linkify-object\"&gt;https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/galaxy\"&gt;Galaxy</a> Vectors by Vecteezy</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<a galaxy-background\"=\"\" href=\"&lt;a href=\" https:=\"\" vectors=\"\" www.freepik.com=\"\">Galaxy\" class=\"redactor-linkify-object\"&gt;https://www.freepik.com/vectors/galaxy-background\"&gt;Galaxy</a> background vector created by pikisuperstar - www.freepik.com</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Galaxy\" class=\"redactor-linkify-object\"&gt;https://www.freepik.com/vectors/galaxy-wallpaper'&gt;Galaxy wallpaper vector created by freepik - www.freepik.com<br/></strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Star\" class=\"redactor-linkify-object\"&gt;https://www.freepik.com/photos/star-sky'&gt;Star sky photo created by kjpargeter - www.freepik.com<br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Dice rolling sound effect from Pixabay<br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Music: \u201cCosmos\u201d, from PlayOnLoop.com<br/>Licensed under\u00a0Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0</p>\n\n<p>Note: All graphics were distorted to fit the models.\u00a0If we've missed something or someone, please let us know and we'll do our best to correct it in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>Developed by Mich-357 and Errena Storm<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/808/808fd82e9dfd3c6375f680c014f0d26b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Errena Storm"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
