The game is comprised of three different mazes, each with a different theme.  Players enter the mazes and work their ways to an exit.  Along the way there could be objects or clues to find, there could be actions to complete, or there could be puzzles to solve.  In any case, getting through the mazes is one thing, getting out is something else entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis version is Windows OS compatible and it was created with Mouse and Keyboard control support.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T02:31:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/650/65060b730ac1ef8bf9ddca2eda6a7603.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gerald W Lynch"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GJ Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
