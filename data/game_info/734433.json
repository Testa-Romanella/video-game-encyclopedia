Collision Controller!\u00a0That's right, your new job will be to protect the public by deciding who can go where, and when, to avoid any car-based collisions!\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p><strong>SIMPLE CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>[You can toggle traffic lights by Left-Clicking on them]</p>\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nTHE RULES ARE SIMPLE!\r\n<strong>GREEN LIGHTS</strong> - When the light is green cars will keep driving past the light.<br/><strong>RED LIGHTS </strong>- When the light is red cars will stop at the light until it is green.\r\n<p>Keep cars moving, but keep people safe. Each time someone successfully crosses you'll get 500 points! But sometimes it will be best to stop people for their safety.</p>\r\nBut you can't keep the lights on red for too long.\r\n<p>As long as you keep traffic running smoothly, most drivers shouldn't mind. But if you wait too long their patience will thin. You can see this through different emotions emanating from the cars, which will change depending on how long the car has been stopped.</p>\n<strong>SAD</strong> - when a car gets 'sad' you will lose 50 points every two seconds it is sad.<strong>ANGRY\u00a0</strong>-\u00a0when a car gets 'angry' you will lose 100 points every two seconds it is\u00a0angry.\r\nREMEMBER: Don't let cars hit pedestrians!\r\nDon't let cars clash! If two cars collide, it's game over!\r\n<strong>--------------------------------------------</strong>\n<p><em><strong>GAMEPLAY &amp; ART\u00a0BY: SPLENIDDOG</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>MUSIC BY: RAW SOUNDS CREATION</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>MADE FOR THE ScoreSpace Jam 17</em></strong></p>\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n<p><em>All sound effects not by me were found on [Freesound.org] and have a CC0, or Public Domain license</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:49:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/579/5791bb331d5d77921e983eb44d565954.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SplendidDog"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
