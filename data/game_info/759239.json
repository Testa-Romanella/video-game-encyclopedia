Thank you for your patience. :)</strong></p>\n<p>This is a story of two magi, Vyn and Ilar, who find themselves trapped in a collapsing tower with their only hope for salvation being a difficult ritual. Or at least that is what Ilar tells you. The thing is - you don\u2019t remember anything, and Ilar\u2019s story makes less and less sense the closer you are to the ritual. Are they hiding things to protect you from the bitter truth, or are they deceiving you for some more nefarious reason?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Guide Vyn\u2019s actions to death and beyond and uncover Ilar\u2019s truth. Are they your colleague, lover or something completely different?\u00a0Read between the lines of what they are telling you, explore your surroundings for clues and use hands-on deduction to break the viscious circle and set them free.</p>\n<p>This Interactive fiction/visual novel hybrid is made by two people - Ze and Nim and it is our very first game! It features hand drawn illustrations, animated scenes and an original soundtrack, all working together to immerse you into the world of Tal\u2019Dun.<br/></p>\n<p>The game includes descriptions of sexual themes, violence, blood, physical and mental\u00a0abuse, self harm, death, and suicide.
