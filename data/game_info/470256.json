Move the paddle with your arrow keys to bounce the ball,\u00a0destroying\u00a0all bricks in the level. Collect power-ups and avoid penalties as you complete each level.</p>\n<p>System Requirements:</p>\n<ul><li>Windows 10 +\u00a0DirectX 11</li><li>macOS El Capitan or later (Apple Silicon support coming later this year when\u00a0macOS Big Sur releases)</li></ul>\n<p>This game is a simple recreation of the classic Atari hit, Breakout.\u00a0Brick Game\u00a0was created as a pastime and is an experimental application of\u00a0my custom game engine that I've been slowly tinkering with and developing\u00a0over the years. Brick Game is my first attempt at improving game presentation, something that my previous projects (both released and unreleased) lacked. Aside from a couple bugs and issues that I'm not going to bother fixing, I'm fairly pleased with how the project turned out.\u00a0Brick Game was written in C++ with some platform-specific Objective-C++ on macOS. Brick Game uses Metal on macOS and DirectX 11 on Windows, as well as the following frameworks:</p>\n<ul><li>GLFW\u00a0(window handling)</li><li>GLM\u00a0(math)</li><li>PortAudio\u00a0(audio)</li><li>stb\u00a0(image and vorbis loading)</li></ul>\n<p>This is a forgiving game, if you lose your lives you only have to restart that particular level (with 4 lives). Progress is saved when you exit the game.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>The game occasionally crashes when a power-up/punishment is collected on the same frame the ball is destroyed. This is extremely rare.</li><li>When completing a level while the multi-ball power-up is spawning, a \"ghost\" ball will remain on the screen. This ball\u00a0sprite disappears when the next level is loaded.</li></ul><p>Credit to @TheKeaver for additional levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T02:29:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef8172e957164778ef0a17bac02dcc7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dr_lollipop_"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
