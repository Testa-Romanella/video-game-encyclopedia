The first wave\u00a0is a classical invasion, where you need to defeat\u00a0all of the aliens before they kill you. When the\u00a0location is cleared, you warp to the next one, but you need to be careful. These evil monsters will try to run into you to prevent you from arriving to the next place. Dodge them all to fight the next wave of enemies, and then again warp to the next location.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck and remember - you have only one ship.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Serpent7776</strong>: concept, programming<br/><strong>Igal</strong>: concept, sounds, cover image<br/>invader graphics from\u00a0https://www.seekpng.com/, but somewhat modified<br/>cover font:\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/games-font.html</p>\n<p><strong>Jam info:</strong></p>\n<p>Theme interpretation: Retro game that hopefully brings back some memories</p>\n<p>Limitation interpretation: The game has alternating waves of enemies. The first wave is a\u00a0classic arcade shooter (invasion wave). The second wave is a dodge obstacles kind of game that is inspired by racing games (warp wave). Then the game switches back to arcade shooter and then again to dodge mode and keeps alternating between the two. There's no\u00a0\u00a0ending, but each subsequent warp wave is longer than the previous, so technically it ends at super long warp wave.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T02:51:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d22/d229bbf73b905e7e2f4d2529269951e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Igal Bronshtein", "Serpent7776"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
