Your story will unfold <strong>based on your decisions</strong>, to the degree of which <strong>cannot be replicated</strong> by any other player.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nARhap is a <strong>turn based RPG</strong> which includes <strong>intense and fast paced real-time-dodging</strong>. You'll be faced with <strong>many challenges</strong>, and you'll have to fight your way through the world by either <strong>fighting, or awkwardly trying to make friends with your opponents</strong> through pick-up-lines, mean jokes, memory games, and other strange and funny interactions.\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>16 Potential party members for you to interact with!</strong> - Each of these characters has a <strong>bold personality</strong>, and a <strong>large amount of depth</strong> for you to discover.

Would you dare come face to face with the infamous 3x3 slide puzzle?</li>\n<li>Last but not least... <strong>An Online Social System and Event System!</strong> - You'll be able to share Rhapsodies between your friends. Share, combine, read through, and maybe even delete your friend's Rhapsodies! Timed events will be coming out after the game's release, so that you'll have the chance to continue your Rhapsodies. More on this later...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout each playthrough, <strong>every decision, action, and event that takes place is recorded into your Rhapsody</strong>! Athenian Rhapsody holds so much variability that no two adventures will ever be the same, making each Rhapsody truly unique! The information contained in a Rhapsody ranges from <strong>each character you've interacted with</strong> as well as <strong>how many times your protagonist has farted.</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nEach time you complete a playthrough, you'll <strong>receive a Rhapsody</strong>. Each Rhapsody acts as a way to <strong>take something tangible</strong> from your experience with your playthrough, and hold onto it forever. There are even <strong>ways to create new Rhapsodies by combining them,</strong> to multiply their complexity and create something <strong>absolutely insane</strong>!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll be able to <strong>use these Rhapsodies in various ways</strong> such as <strong>socializing with friends, accessing special timed in-game event adventures,</strong> and maybe even something outside of the game one day. Who knows! <strong>The sky is the limit</strong>!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it might <strong>not</strong> be the absolute coolest ever, but it's definitely a game! Maybe even <strong>the game ever</strong>!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's no dearth of adventures for any player, no matter what your play style is. Whether you prefer <strong>intense battles</strong>, <strong>rich dialogue</strong>, <strong>hunting for secrets</strong>, or <strong>aiming for completionism</strong>, you're sure to have a blast in Athens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ultimate goal of Athenian Rhapsody is to provide a real, impactful experience for everyone who plays it. There's something for everyone and I hope that every player can relate to their story somehow, and maybe even reflect on their own lives. Remember to have fun, it's a game!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, the developer of Athenian Rhapsody <strong>cannot </strong>do a backflip. Maybe one day, but for now he is <strong>too scared</strong>!<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T13:39:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a00/a00fc7bf357e2179463d2b2486cb644a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nico Papalia"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Top Hat Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
