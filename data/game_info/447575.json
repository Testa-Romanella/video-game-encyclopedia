With his country now annexed and its magical resources, the mana wells, now in the hands of a greater empire, all that could be done was try to live quietly and avoid persecution for fighting back. But, only weeks after the war\u2019s end, the empire\u2019s tampering with the mana wells have had catastrophic consequences, and now monsters from somewhere beyond Ira\u2019s world are leaking in. If he and his new neighbors hope to live safely, Ira will have to train them into a militia to defend their isolated little town.</p>\n<p>This is Liville\u2019s eleventh hour.</p>\n<p>Liville: The Eleventh Hour is a turn-based strategy game where players must devise their tactics using variable, randomly-generated weapons. Control up to four playable units to clear maps of the invading monsters and save the town, earning yourself resources along the way to spend on new weapons sporting randomly-assigned stats and modifiers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T05:01:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/635/635d9b51894903345cf5afdeaeec1225.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oscar Ngan", "sgg314"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
