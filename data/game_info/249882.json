It was super <br/>exciting to work in a new enviroment.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>The theme was Harvest. I approached this theme <br/>with a story of magical character known as Death <br/>(character inspired by Terry Pratchet's - Mort) <br/>who is struggling to find anything interesting <br/>in his job other than killing people.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I would like to thank my friend, Atri <br/>who composed the short track you can hear <br/>while playing the game.<br/>And also to the Bitsy discord community <br/>without which I would not be able to finish\u00a0<br/>this project. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6ad54b44f774ccb2fff6e690ad855580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Restive Panda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
