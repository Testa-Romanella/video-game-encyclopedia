My dream is to become a video game conceptor\u00a0^-^</p>\n<p>This is my first attempt called <strong>Super Nael Adventure</strong>, the main character name is <em>Nael</em> and he has to find his way through a maze of platforms and battle against the evil <em>B-Bots</em>.</p>\n<p>As you can see it's only the level 1 for now and available for free. I worked on it alone with\u00a0the help of few Youtube videos and tutorials. The game was made using <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>.</p>\n<p>The sprites and the background music are private works. The sound effects were downloaded and\u00a0modified.</p>\n<p>The background music was made by an online friend of mine named \"Spectralist\"\u00a0<em>(thanks again ^^)</em></p>\n<p>If you enjoy the demo please consider supporting me by donating on <strong>my Ko-fi</strong>, I'm still working very hard\u00a0on my dream project. I hope this game will start everything for me.</p>\n<p>The full game will come up with 8 more levels :</p>\n<p>- level 1 (current) to level 7 = normal levels with new gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>- level 8 = Boss Battle.</p>\n<p>I'm open to advices and propositions.</p>\n<p><strong>My Email :</strong> mjlebib@gmail.com</p>\n<p><strong>My Discord :</strong> Sanlyn Jyn#5119</p>\n<p><strong>My Ko-Fi :</strong> https://ko-fi.com/sanlynjyn</p>\n<p>Have fun :D</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em>--Jamil Lebib || Sanlyn Jyn</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:52:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df2a20650ad590cef8d3bd1ae515e915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SanlynJyn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
