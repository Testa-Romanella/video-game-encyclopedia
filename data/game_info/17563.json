However, part of the rain was crystals, which became a source of valuable fuel. When the crystals were over, the Earthmen found a way to teleport to the planet from which these crystals flew to Earth. People moved to this planet in considerable numbers, managed to settle down there, but when they extracted crystals, they accidentally opened the portal to an unknown dimension. The portal became the door for the monsters that captured the planet. Only a small number of people remained. They want to survive. And they are trying to regain control of vital objects.<br />\nYou can play three characters. All of them have different abilities and weapons. Everyone has their own ways to fight for life and territory. A range of improvements allows you to acquire new weapons, sharpen the methods of violence and increase the stock of life. Ammunition causes more damage, resistance to poisons appears, there are clues about invisible monsters. Yes, it is useful for surviving earthlings - it&#39;s difficult to fight off monsters. Because they are everywhere and quite reasonable. This planet belongs to them already. Hundreds times increased insects and reptiloids, abundantly armed and perceiving people either as a forage, or as intruders. From mission to mission, heroes make their way through mountains of corpses, crowds of furious beasts and through territories that have become empty under the onslaught of aliens. And this constant tension is periodically replaced by exclamations of heroes: life is beautiful!</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2007-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-22T22:47:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/173/1735a8c1a2c3386d55e2c63d8b2406e3.jpg", "website": "http://www.shadowgroundssurvivor.com/", "rating": 2.68, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 88, "owned": 1693, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 22, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 74, "suggestions_count": 591, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 74, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Frozenbyte"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Frozenbyte"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
