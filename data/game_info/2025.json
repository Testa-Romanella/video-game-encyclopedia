While pressing down firmly, slowly tilt the top of the pencil - beyond a critical angle the tip will suddenly slip away leaving a line drawn on the paper. This line determines your move or shot on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Lead Wars simulates this mechanic using the touch-screen as if you're touching the top of a real pencil.
