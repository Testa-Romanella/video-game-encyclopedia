Play as Maryasha Karliner, a jaded button pusher at a bigwig tech company who decides to go for a countryside drive to get the edge off. What happens next can only be described as a sickly Victorian child's fever dream.<br/>This is my first attempt at making a twine, so please let me know things to improve for the future. I had a lot of fun making this, and I hope you will have as much fun playing it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T09:30:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faf/faf3ec666f23e64885947dc4943eda28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mave Goren"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
