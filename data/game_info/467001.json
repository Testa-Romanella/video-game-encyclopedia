The more objectives the SpyBall reaches, the more variables you can add. But be careful - once a variable has been added, it cannot be removed!</p>\n<p>Oh, did I forget to mention how the variables are controlled. During the design process, one of the interns had the bright idea of allocating all of the variables to be controlled by one single slider. Streamlining they called it! Unfortunately, this can lead to some difficult balancing when testing the ball and it can easily get out of hand. If you ever find it too much though, you can always reset the SpyBall to it's control state.\u00a0</p><p>You can play this game either in this web browser or as a download (Windows only).</p>\n<p>Designed and Developed by Andrew Searle for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 (Game made in 48 hours).</p>\n<p>Original Music by Andrew Searle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/4147c17dca9f9a7251cfbfb83966202e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["andrew7fls"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
