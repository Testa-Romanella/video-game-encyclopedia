We also liked the idea of doing a boat-based game set in an ocean with islands you can visit. Of course a game has to have a goal, so we thought perhaps bringing our cute animals to others to calm them would be the main goal.</p>\n<p>To play this game you can use a controller or keyboard/mouse. WASD/left stick to move, mouse/right stick for camera controls, and the aura pulse is activated by click/A button.</p><p>Follow the bird.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T04:04:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8e/f8eb09cfacae6e24dedc86ae98731c38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Splerp", "Jepp", "zoron19"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
