This GGJ 2012 arcade game was made for use with a \"DJ Hero\" turntable, but can also be played using the keyboard.</em></em></strong></p><p>Made for Global Game Jam 2012 at ISART (Paris) using Slick2D, a library built on top of LWJGL which is better known as \"the library that was used to make Minecraft\".</p><p><strong>Objective</strong><br/>The aim is to intercept the falling balls with the appropriate head: using the wrong head will stop the ball, but the snake in question will be stunned temporarily. In addition, the white balls heal the earth, so should not be intercepted at all. Survive as long as you can, try to beat my high-score (1590 so far).<br/></p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Programming</strong>: William Dyce, Emmanuel Corno</li><li><strong>Art</strong>: Loren Costet, Steve Ohl, Antoine Druaux</li><li><strong>Sound</strong>: Antoine Druaux</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e1/6e19ed9742c7c103b7a2ab8c0a9d2c75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["wilbefast"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
