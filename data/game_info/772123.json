This project was the project while I attended The Game Development &amp; Project Management Program at Sripatum University. Feel free to visit one of my teammate's pages at @chaleewt.itch.io</p>\n<p>In the game, the player takes on the role of a hero who comes to save the village in the valley from monsters. Manage your resources and build towers to defeat the incoming waves by killing all enemies before they can reach the village gate. Think of the strategy and face off against the merciless monsters.<br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/>The player will have limited resources in the beginning so be aware of that because you will not be able to\u00a0build a tower if you don't have enough required resources. While. you get additional resources each time you kill a monster. However, some resources are random to get, so come up with a good plan before you build a tower.<br/><br/>In addition, the player also has two magic skills that required no resources but still have quite a long cooldown time, so they should be used when necessary.<br/><br/><br/>\n<strong>MY TASKS</strong><br/>\r\n My tasks were mainly about Camera movement, Tower Building systems, and Level design.\r\n It was my first time, making a game with a team after learning Unity\u00a0for a while.\r\n I got a chance to\u00a0use class diagram UML\u00a0and version control (Bitbucket) for the first time as well. It is a precious game development experience for me :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T10:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32a/32abb948c235c4bfd92a5fc1c7993214.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["waranyas"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
