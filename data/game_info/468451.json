You've sneaked onboard one of the many (many) planes, but alas, you've forgotten all your tools except your endless supply of shor fused bombs, which you also accidentally lit on fire. How are you supposed to take down a seemingly infinite army of airplanes? Why by using the planes against themselves of course!<br/><br/>Hop onboard a plane and use your explosions to guide the crashing plane into each other, then fearlessly leap out of the wreckage to find new planes to infiltrate. Be careful though, the bombs are temperamental and prone to blowing up if you don't use them. Constantly.<br/><br/>Arrow Keys to move while falling, and to guide a plane while sabotaging.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T20:04:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4c/f4cdb90d00302da024b8c782cc282efc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quaade"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
