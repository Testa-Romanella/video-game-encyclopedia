Sorry If There Are Any Bugs... [Sorry, audio may not work during the game]\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>PLEASE READ</strong> - We are sorry if this game does not have a lot of interesting gameplay. Me And Ripnet are trying to make a story that spans across multiple games. We started off with Virus, and now we are making this. Do we know what the future holds for this story? Kinda, as i am making a continuation to virus. Please, if you don't like how there is little gameplay, vote it as you would. Just understand this.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T07:41:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e76/e76bd0b7fb3881c38bcf63b53ed34a92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ripnet", "DeeTDM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
