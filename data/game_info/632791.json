It might have been pink today, you may have missed it. So look up, look down, there is a meaning around.</p>\n<p>An open world metaphorical game inspired by the philosophies of Alan Watts. The game is based on the ideology that life is not a journey with an important meaning waiting at its end, but it is like a dance, the road itself is the meaningful experience.
