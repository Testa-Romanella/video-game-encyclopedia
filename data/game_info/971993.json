Evil Otto and his deadly robots are back in this reimagining of the 1980 arcade classic Berzerk. Berzerk: Recharged challenges you to fight your way through a deadly maze filled with waves of menacing, vocal robots. Deft twin-stick control and power-ups are the only way to survive, as you shoot your way through room after room in this never-ending dystopian maze. And don\u2019t forget, Evil Otto may have a smile on his face, but he is deadly and invincible. <br/><br/>As with all Recharged games, you can chase a high score in arcade mode, or take on one of the many hand-crafted challenges to test your shooting and dodging skills. If things get too hard, you can always grab a friend to double your firepower in local-co-op.<br/><br/>Megan McDuffee\u2019s original soundtrack of sci-fi synths captures the ambiance of a harrowing space station shootout \u2013 and a very cool 80s arcade.<h3>Key Features</h3><br/><ul><li>Arcade Mode: Survive an endless maze of random rooms that get progressively harder the further you get.
