Social distancing is in effect, and masks are required.<br/><br/><ul><li>3 trails to explore<br/></li><li>14 photo locations<br/></li><li>10 lost items<br/></li><li>11 hikers to befriend</li></ul><br/>You can be nice to strangers by being a good listener, or by returning their lost items. <br/>You can stay in touch with your best friend who can\u2019t come hiking with you anymore. <br/>You can\u2019t take anything away from anywhere (except for the litter on the ground). <br/><br/>It\u2019s short and replayable! It\u2019s about getting better acquainted with friendly strangers by seeing them repeatedly.<br/><br/>The environments are sourced from photographs and pieced together like a collage. The trails draw inspiration from hikes in the Northeastern US (specifically NJ, NY, CT, MA). We wanted the place to feel realistic, idyllic, and familiar like a nostalgic memory, all at the same time. <br/><br/>If you\u2019re looking for a short, relaxing, and cozy time, come visit our trails and be friends with our hikers!<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T22:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/305c235156cccaad380641fae77a6580.jpg", "website": "https://www.thesheepsmeow.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["The Sheep's Meow"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["The Sheep's Meow"], "esrb_rating": null}
