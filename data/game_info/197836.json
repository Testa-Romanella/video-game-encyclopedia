After the 3rd battle, you need to use (click) the top-right menu to use a skill on the crates to the south in order to progress; I didn't really think to add tutorial messages to explain this, so I ought to say that here.</p>\n<p>Also ignite doesn't cause burn, I ran out of time to add that feature, sadly.<br/></p>\n<p>The main font for dialogue and menu options is Hey Gorgeous, and can be found here:<br/></p>\n<p>http://www.kevinandamanda.com/fonts/freescrapbookfonts/hey-gorgeous/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/153/15314e33597abac38f757aab34fdd04f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rustfoot"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
