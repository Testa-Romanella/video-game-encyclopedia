As you eke out survival by scouring the wastelands for salvage in your Mechs you\u2019ll tackle the denizens of the wastes. These include bands of wastelander's, terrifying bio-mecha, alien constructs and the powerful Corpos who still own the vast majority of resources within the land.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Salvage Union uses a core d20 system with a variable range of resolution and eschews the likes of character stats for a series of powerful and evocative Mech and Pilot abilities. As befitting a Mech game there\u2019s a whole slew of customisation options to refit your Mech with salvage that you find in the wastelands.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The Quickstart PDF includes\r\n</p>\n<p>The core rules to play and run sessions of Salvage Union including the core mechanic, combat, heat and salvaging.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>6 Premade Mechs\u00a0\r\n</li><li>6 Premade Pilots\u00a0\r\n</li><li>A sample scenario \u2018The Downing of the Atychos\u2019\u00a0\r\n</li><li>A sample of the Downtime and Crafting System within Salvage Union to modify your premade mechs and build your own Mechs including lots of tables.\r\n</li><li>Additional Weapons, Systems and Modules for your Mechs.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Additional NPC mechs, pilot and creature profiles with some customisation options.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>A sample BIO-TITAN\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Guidance for The Mediator (GM) to create and run scenarios of their own.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T13:59:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac35424ad780aca415dc1003f78cb1bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leyline Press"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
