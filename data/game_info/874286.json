Composeman is a one-stage demo of a hypothetical video game inspired by classical music and the Mega Man series.</p>\n<p>Though framed and presented as a full game, this is a proof-of-concept that only contains one level: \"Bologne Man\", loosely based on the locations that Joseph Bologne lived in during his life.</p>\n<p>A full version is currently not planned - though I would like to hear if there's sufficient interest! Please consider donating or signing up on my Patreon to support future projects if it fancies you.</p>\n<p>The original \"Compose Man\" is a fan album by Chips 'N Cellos of an imaginary Mega Man fan game with classical composers as robot masters. This demo uses the soundtrack under a CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 licence and spins it into a standalone game.</p>\n<p>ChipsNCellos Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ChipsNCellos</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and have fun!</p>\n<p>~~~~</p>\n<p>My Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/EiriSanada <br/>My Patreon: https://patreon.com/eirifu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T13:32:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb7/bb70a71394411f5425f3a71b3b63ed3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eirifu"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
