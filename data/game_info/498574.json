{"id": 498574, "slug": "project-escape-prototype", "name": "Project: ESCAPE (Prototype)", "name_original": "Project: ESCAPE (Prototype)", "description": "<p><em>Project: ESCAPE (prototype name) is a puzzle/adventure game, blending together puzzle gameplay with a rich narrative via more typical visual novel elements in the vein of games such as 999 or Virtue's Last Reward.</em><em><br/>The prototype focuses on two colourful characters--Kevin and Alice, both of whom wake up with cloudy heads and a pair of handcuffs binding them together within a strange prison cell. Will they be able to solve the strange puzzles that lie in wait for them and escape this foreboding room? And just what awaits them on the other side of that metal door? Somehow...they have the feeling that their strange adventures have only just begun.</em><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Hi there! Thanks for checking this prototype out! This is a small puzzle game I've been working on slowly in my spare time over the last year for fun--and after a lot of setbacks, I'm finally ready to present it to the world!<br/><br/>I will preface this by saying that if you're coming to this project from previous games of mine, please be aware that there is <strong><em>no adult content</em></strong> within this game. It was created with the intention of being something a little more lighthearted and accessible. An experimental project, if you will! Please don't panic or despair though, because I still intend to work on, and make adult games. I just wanted a change of pace for this particular project, and don't want to feel I'm forever bound to only making adult stuff. <br/><br/>This largely serves as a way for me to broaden my skills with Ren'Py too as I attempt to script all manner of fancy systems!<br/><br/>So, with that out of the way--outside of the brief synopsis above, what does this contain? Well, allow me to break out my handy bullet points! Project: ESCAPE contains the following:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>A short romp through a puzzle filled cell that should last roughly 5 - 10 minutes, depending on how much you poke around for the bonus dialogue and how challenging the puzzles might prove to be for you.</li><li>Fully voiced dialogue for both Alice <strong><em>and</em></strong> Kevin (yes, the male main character is voiced this time around!) with roughly 300 lines of dialogue in-between the narration.</li><li>3 puzzles to be solved, with progressively more helpful hints from the characters if you need them.</li><li>A simple inventory system that will keep track of items you have (though for simplicity's sake they'll be used automatically at the right time)</li><li>Point-and-click style gameplay in-between the dialogue. Click to examine areas of interest, and view the cell from several key angles! We've come a long way from simple menu based navigation!</li></ul>\n<p>I understand this game won't be for everyone--but I certainly hope you give it a try if anything listed above piques your interest! Let me know what you think if you get the chance down the line. Either way, I'm incredibly proud of what\u00a0I've accomplished here, and am happy to finally present it to the world after a number of unfortunate setbacks in development.<br/><br/>And while I've tried to iron out every bug possible--this was a VERY complex thing to put together, with lots of moving parts. So if by chance something breaks, please let me know and I'll put out a new version as fast as I can while profusely apologising for the inconvenience.<br/><br/><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music - </strong>Audistory Music<br/><strong>3d Background Renders - </strong>GoyaMunoz<br/><strong>2d Sprites + CG Art -</strong> Lite<br/><strong>Item Icons -\u00a0</strong>KurosakiKeroro <br/><strong>Background Edits -</strong> Aimless Art<br/><strong>VA - </strong>Mimi Hung (Alice), Griffin Puatu (Kevin)<br/><strong>Writing, Scripting, Just Barely Functional Minigames -</strong> FrostWorks<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T04:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c51/c511729b5a88d4195142338c307d5dc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FrostWorks"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
