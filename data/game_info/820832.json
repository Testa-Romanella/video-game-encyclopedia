My name is Q Yoneda, a comic artist now trying to make video games.</p>\n\n<p>This is my submission for this year's GMTK Game Jam.</p>\n<p>My ultimate goal for every game jam I participate in is \"finish &amp; submit\" (no matter how unpolished the game\u00a0is at the deadline). So I had to cut back on many features I wanted to add.\u00a0Here are some features;</p>\n<ul><li>More proper SFX</li><li>More diversity in random event occurance</li><li>More levels aka more puzzle</li><li>Wildcard limitations</li></ul>\n<p>+ Bug fixes (e.i. I just realized that the WILDCARD button is pressable on the title/instruction/game clear screens).</p>\n<p>One \"roll of the dice\" circumstance for me was on Thursday, I decided to switch my engine to Godot from Unity. There are various reasons for that but basically, I needed to learn the basics of the engine within like... 12 hours? So there's that.</p>\n<p>All in all, I was able to manage to wrap it up and make it work as a cute mini-game\u00a0in time. I'm pretty proud of it.</p>\n<p>I'd be honoured and very grateful if you happened to stop\u00a0by this page and played this game. Thank you. Make sure to leave a comment and link to your game if you were a fellow participant! :D</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Q</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T04:02:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44e/44e522cd0fa6463d360520e52517fb63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Q Yoneda"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
