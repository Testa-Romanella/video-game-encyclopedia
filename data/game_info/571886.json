When Inspector Warren arrives at the Hastings' Baptist Mining Community, he\u00a0finds that all is not up to federal standards. When Warren refuses to take a cash bribe to give\u00a0the Mine a passing grade, the greedy Director Hastings triggers a cave-in during Warren's\u00a0investigation. A nearby miner calls out to Warren, telling him to delve deeper to reach the main\u00a0shaft elevator to secure his escape. The inspector is equipped for basic mine operations but not\u00a0for mine rescue, so they are on their own after the tunnel collapses. Along the way, Warren finds\u00a0tape recordings left by miners who secretly sent for his presence at the mine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Programming:\u00a0Bryan Ambriz,\u00a0Ryan Lamb</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0Calvin Tran,\u00a0Billy Deloe,\u00a0Nng Cindyana,\u00a0Jaye Kimzey</p>\n<p>Rigging:\u00a0Jaye Kimzey</p>\n<p>Level Design:\u00a0Boudicca Minchin</p>\n<p>Narrative:\u00a0Boudicca Minchin,\u00a0Jay Story</p>\n<p>Sound:\u00a0Kendrick Haskins (Music and SFX),\u00a0Boudicca Minchin (SFX),\u00a0Martha Diaz (guitar on credits track)</p>\n<p>Actors:\u00a0Inspector - Jay Story;\u00a0Director - Eric Brock;\u00a0Miners -\tBryan Ambriz,\u00a0Owen Austin Donoho,\u00a0Daniel Domingo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T03:50:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18e/18eb93dcb202f4fa82b3e69a87af2cf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["csufvgdc", "bravestcolour"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
