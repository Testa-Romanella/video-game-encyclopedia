I will fix it in a new version when the game jam will end. The main problems are :</p>\n<p>- Luck is not implemented yet (if you have luck, you will find more treasure)</p>\n<p>- Starting with an empty inventory is not very fun (I will add a \"pick item A or B\" phase before the dungeon so you can have 3 or 4 items)</p>\n<p>- If you reach agility 20, then you are invincible (send me a screenshot of your inventory on Twitter to show me it's possible !\u00a0@blogcreationjv )</p>\n<p>- Removing HP when removing an item that gives HP is a bad idea</p>\n<p>- A\u00a0bug in the inventory can help you get +999 in each characteristic (can you find it.. :p)</p>\n<p>__________________________________________________________<br/></p>\r\nFrench speaker\u00a0\r\n<p>Vous pouvez retrouver chaque jour un conseil sur le game dev sur mon compte Instagram https://instagram.com/creationdejeuxvideo</p>\n<p>Vous pouvez aussi me suivre sur Twitter :\u00a0https://twitter.com/blogcreationjv</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/448/448af37abeac3a7d0abe55ac2adb54cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Hiinds"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
