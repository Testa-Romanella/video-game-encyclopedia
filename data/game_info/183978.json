Comment your score below.</p><p>For people of my generation the ancestors to the flash drives and cds of today may seem like ancient technology. The VHS tape feels like an incredibly bulky way to store data.</p><p>In this game you can go back to the most tedious way to reset a medium: rewinding. A \"clip\" will be played (some humorous comments about vhs tapes) at the end (maximum 6 seconds) it will be rewinded at double the speed. Your goal is to pause by hitting [space] at the exact start of the video and not go too far into the title screen. After you get your rank hit any key to try again.</p><p>Comment your closest score below!</p><p>This game was made in 3 1/2 hours for ludum dare 36.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/344352c80569d32be858ade8686c4851.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SomethinBoutGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
