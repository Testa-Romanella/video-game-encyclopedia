As PFC John Falk, you have volunteered to stay back and buy time for your CO, Sgt Luther Hackney, to escape the onslaught of mutated creatures from the Deadlands and warn Marema of Garen\u2019s betrayal. Remember: Bravery is standing by your friends, even when you do not know the outcome. Courage is standing alone, when you know you have already lost. Hold off the enemy as long as you can, and become legend.  This is your LAST STAND.</em>\n</p>\n<p>When <em>Last Stand</em> takes place, it is ten months since the start of The Reclamation, and John's squad has just been betrayed by Marema\u2019s former allies, soldiers from the northern country of Garen. Beset on all sides by monsters and malfunctioning battle drones, PFC John Falk and Sgt. Luther Hackney are the last surviving members of Squad 4. With their vehicle disabled, John volunteers to stay behind so that Luther can (hopefully) make it back to the city of Coluna and report Garen's treachery. Will he make it? Or will John's sacrifice be for nothing? That remains to be seen...\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Last Stand</em> is a top-down, Action/Survival shooter in which the player must battle against endless waves of enemies in an effort to stay alive as long as possible. Players begin with only their trusty S9 Togusa between themselves and certain death, but <em>Last Stand</em> boasts a formidable array of weapons to choose from, each with its own rate of fire, damage potential, and reload time. John isn't completely alone in this battle, either. By racking up kills and completing waves, players can accrue currency known as Volts; spending these Volts will allow the player to spawn turrets and other useful gadgets to help John in his battle against the monstrous hordes of the Deadlands.\r\n</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY\r\n  </p>\n<p>-Left Thumbstick controls John\u2019s movement<br/>-Right Thumbstick controls the direction John fires<br/>-Thumbsticks will adjust their location based on player\u2019s finger placement</p>\n\n<p>VOLTS\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0-Volts (currency) are tracked in the upper-right corner of the screen, and can be used to purchase ammunition and to deploy turrets.
