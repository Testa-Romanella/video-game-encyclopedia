It was supposed to be a game, with goals (like following the crowd requirements and get a score from that) but I'm fine with the simulator-like result. If you missed the new year's firework, I hope you'll have fun building your own.</p><p>Sfx from freesounds.org<br/></p>\n<p>Happy New Year !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T06:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/22715bb987ace7dbf19e96abaade770d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["draelent"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
