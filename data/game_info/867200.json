The Devil cut you a deal though. If you can handle whose souls they can harvest, and whose are to go through, they'll let you go. But if you make just 3 mistakes, you'll stay there forever.</p>\n<p>To be allowed to harvest a soul, it must have committed at least 10 points worth of sins. You can check the life story the soul wants to tell you, and compare with the souls' true thoughts, to find any discrepancies, and see which sins it actually committed.<br/></p>\n<p>\u2500\u2500\u2500 NOTICE \u2500\u2500\u2500</p>\n<p>The game was made with the following controller in mind.
