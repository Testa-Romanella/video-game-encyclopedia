The player must use cards to represent different elements such as water, sunlight, worshipper, and magic to help the tree grow and survive against environmental threats such as corruption, tribal creatures, witchs, volcanoes and diseases.</p>\n<p>The game has been made with Unity Engine in\u00a02023 Global Game Jam, just in 48 hours. Since theme was about roots,\u00a0 We have\u00a0decided the genre as\u00a0\"isometric card-puzzle\"</p>\n<p>Due to limited time, some of the\u00a0mechanics are not implemented in the game yet. We hope to develop other features in game in a short time.</p>\n<p>If you like the game, we are waiting for your valuable feedbacks.</p>\n<p>Our team members:</p>\n<p><strong>G\u00f6kay Ak\u00e7ay</strong> /\u00a0Unity Developer</p>\n<p><strong>Batuhan Turan </strong>/ Unity Developer</p>\n<p><strong>G\u00f6kay Tacal</strong> / 2D-Pixel Artist</p>\n<p><strong>\u0130lhan Kara </strong>/ 2D-Pixel Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf K\u0131z\u0131lkaya</strong> / Sound Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T08:59:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97d/97d597d5c06521e1a5569cf16ac96e5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thorin1904"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
