{"id": 975738, "slug": "funny-football", "name": "Funny Football", "name_original": "Funny Football", "description": "This is a casual football game. You can control the movement of two football players by your two hands respectively at the same time. It is definitely a challenge to do so, and you sometimes may try to use the keys of football player #1 to control player #2 since those two players will continuously switch position. However, this is the fun part of this game, especially when you play the local PVP mode. The person who makes less mistakes and catches more opportunities will get the final victory. Besides this, this game also provides some other modes like 1v1, 2v2 with AI team member for people who do not enjoy multi task.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is currently still on test stage, and we will add more features and game modes into it in the future. It is also possible to make an online PVP mode and create a rank system for it if we get enough support. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease be free to leave any comments and feedbacks, and they are important for us to keep improving this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T09:08:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45b557f156d0c3aebe8060559b0cb1cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meilong"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Meilong"], "esrb_rating": null}
