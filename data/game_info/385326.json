Dementophobia, and the prologue, is the first game made by Jonathan Fournier. I'm a solo developer 3 months in developing games.\u00a0 Dementophobia: Prologue took me 3 months to develop the game from conception, learning Unity and Blender,\u00a0 coding, 3D modeling, level design and so on. Dementophobia: Prologue takes place before the full game Dementophobia which is in development, and will take the concept of the prologue and expand on it.\u00a0 Thank you for your support and if you'd like to help development, check out the social media links and ways to donate.</p>\n\n\n<br/><br/><br/>* MAC version of Dementophobia: Prologue is untested since I don't have a MAC.<br/><br/>\n<p>Ver. 1.0.0: Initial Release. </p>\n<p>Ver. 1.0.1: Minor Script Adjustment (One of the puzzles had a bypass) </p>\n<p>Ver 1.0.2: UI Adjustments (Battery UI was messed up for some)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T06:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1e/c1e553670c92199d1ee30608ce6cb824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["A French-Canadian Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
