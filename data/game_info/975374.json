{"id": 975374, "slug": "creature-summon-showdown-moment", "name": "Creature Summon: Showdown Moment", "name_original": "Creature Summon: Showdown Moment", "description": "A creative first-person card game that mimics VR perspective and operation. Combining science fiction and magic, it features a non-traditional card game mode and a 3D spatial UI. Players can throw cards to any position (with physics system) by using the mouse quickly.<h3>Features:</h3>\u00b7 Unique gameplay mechanism: The game mimics the way VR throws objects. In this game, players can drag and throw cards with the mouse. Cards use physical systems, and where they are thrown depends entirely on player operations. The game also comes with 10 dance actions, and players can dance and throw cards for high immersion.<br/><br/>\u00b7 Gameplay: You can only summon up to 5 creatures on the field at the same time. Once your creatures reach 5, throwing cards again will not summon more creatures. You need to wait for the number of monsters to drop below 5 before picking up cards and throwing them again. After the creature is summoned, it will prioritize attacking or occupying flags against the creatures it restrains. (Ranged creatures will not actively occupy flags, only melee creatures will occupy flags).<br/><br/>\u00b7 Creature factions: There are currently 5 factions, which will increase to 9 in the future. Each faction has more than 10 creatures, and the total number of creatures will exceed 100.<br/><br/>\u00b7 Realistic models: Further enhance immersion.<h3>Multiplayer Online</h3>Play with friends in the Steam lobby and enjoy multiplayer mode, it's even more fun and free!<br/><br/>\u00b7 PS:<br/>The gameplay of this game may be unique. Players who play for the first time should take a look at the text description in \"Tutorial\" to understand the game rules and mechanism before playing. Due to budget issues, no professional translation experts were hired. Except for Chinese, all localized languages of this game are translated by translation software. If there are any translations that are difficult to understand, please send me an email for correction.<br/>For more fun, please experience it in the game personally. Many fun cannot be expressed in words. :P<h3>Thanks</h3>I hope everyone likes the creative gameplay of this game.<h3>Finally, please forgive me</h3>This game is developed by only one person, all the assets are purchased from the store, and the style is not consistent. If you have any gameplay suggestions, please email me. I might not be able to handle the art aspects, as I have no knowledge in that area.
