Explore Baldi's schoolhouse and try to find all 7 notebooks, but don't get caught by Baldi! He wants to play hide-and-seek, but something... Isn't right. Luckily you have a slew of items you can find and use to your advantage, but Baldi also has friends who can cause problems for you if you're not careful. And remember, Baldi hears almost every noise you make, so do what you can to stay quiet!<h3>This is the ultimate version of Baldi's Basics Classic!</h3>Baldi\u2019s Basics Classic Remastered is the ultimate version of the original Baldi\u2019s Basics! It\u2019s a recreation of the original game made in the Baldi\u2019s Basics Plus framework, so it features many of the improvements found in that game, such as more polish, a more authentic art style, directional subtitles, improved NPC AI, and more!<h3>Play in 3 different styles!</h3>You can experience the original game by playing in Classic Style, or Birthday Bash, which wraps all the items up and shuffles them around, by playing in Party Style. Anyone who hasn\u2019t played Baldi\u2019s Basics Plus yet can get a taste of some of that game\u2019s features with the new Demo Style, which mixes many of the new elements found in Baldi\u2019s Basics Plus into the classic map! All three styles can also be played in endless mode, where you can try to collect as many notebooks as possible before getting caught by Baldi!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T04:57:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90d/90db8a41c62f78a7d88801e779a0d57e.jpg", "website": "https://www.basicallygames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Basically Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Basically Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
