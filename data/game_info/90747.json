You will have to manage your new life during the day by choosing between actions to heal yourself, keep your stress low and your morale high.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the night comes you will have to explore the dreamlike world of your unconscious and fight your fears or the consequences of your choices. But you will also have to run from the disease and look for a way out to find hope and peace.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDay and night are connected and everything you do will have an impact on the story.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>The life of someone fighting cancer is not really easy. You must endure other people's stares and since your treatment weakens you a lot, you have to manage your time and accept the fact that there are things you can't do anymore.\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt is also the moment to face the life you have been living. Was I really happy? Did I waste my time? What is the difference between my life and someone else's?\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tInstead of watching someone else fight, \r\n\tWe All End Up Alone invites you to live the experience and fight the disease yourself.\r\n\t\n</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Features :</strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A philosophical journey</strong> through a battle without weapons.</li>\n<li>Originals graphics inspired by <strong>Franco-Belgian comics.</strong></li>\n<li>Daytime part with everyday life management.</li>\n<li>Immersive dialog system with rich background characters.</li>\n<li>Night time part set in a dreamlike world with exploration gameplay.</li>\n<li>Multiple and various dreams to explore.</li>\n<li><strong>Connected parts</strong> (Day &amp; Night), which influence each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<br/></strong></p>\r\nPresskit : http://weallendupalone.com/presskit/sheet.php?p=we_all_end_up_alone<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tGame Website : http://weallendupalone.com/<br/>\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tThe game is \r\n\tstill in development, please follow us for more infos :\n\r\nOur Website : \r\n\thttp://nicepenguins.fr/\r\nTwitter : \r\n\thttps://twitter.com/Nice_Penguins_\r\nFacebook : \r\n\thttps://www.facebook.com/NicePenguins/\r\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/812/8121953c15f595f261f628f13531d4f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nice Penguins"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
