{"id": 670948, "slug": "twin-peaks-meanwhile", "name": "Twin Peaks: Meanwhile", "name_original": "Twin Peaks: Meanwhile", "description": "<p><strong>Twin Peaks: Meanwhile </strong>is a short re imagining of the classic 90s show as if it was made into a Game Boy game. The game is completely centered around Cooper's adventure into the black lodge. There is multiple endings and a host of spirits to interact with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>!!!MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!!!!!</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is made for fans of the show. You might want to avoid playing if you haven't seen all of Twin Peaks and don't want it spoilt for you. Plus it wouldn't make a heap of sense.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Game Boy</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong>MoveD-PadArrow KeysInteractAZBackBXMenuStartEnterInventorySelectShift\r\n\n<p>The game was made in\u00a0<strong>GB Studio</strong>, an amazing piece of software by Chris Maltby. You can really download the ROM and run it on a real Game Boy, (I've tested it). TPM was all made for\u00a0love of Twin Peaks but mostly as a way to learn game dev. This is my first atcual game as well as my first submission to any sort of game jam.\u00a0 As noted in the game, I have more content mapped out but this a short version to submit to the 2021 Game Boy Comp. <br/></p>\n<p>Big shout out to<strong> Robert Doman </strong>and<strong> Goodnight Girl</strong>. Their tutorials helped me immensely through this whole process. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T03:22:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54a/54a3b561e44db102f3b05b5406c920ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tory Sciaccca"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
