The government has decided to take control of over 99% of all resources and raw materials so no one can mine for ore or even recycle without the government\u2019s approval.<br/><br/>The world needs help and only one organisation is committed to saving the world, an organisation who has chosen you to play a key role to change the world for the better.<br/><br/>As a new applicant to the \u2018Save The World\u2019 Project, you are tasked to start your own business to supply the community across the country with natural resources and recycled materials. There are incomplete regeneration projects that need funding and communities that need your help. When your shop is open during the day serve the customers what they want, during the night go to sleep and wake up to a new day with new challenges and random events, no one day is the same.<br/><br/>Recycle everything you find, mine ores wherever you find them and pay the taxes IF YOU MUST!!!
