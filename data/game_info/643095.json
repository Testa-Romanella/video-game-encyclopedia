The premise of the game is simple... don't get hit by the falling anvils. Being a programmer by trade, I\u00a0sought to expand my horizons through game dev and thus I\u00a0joined this game jam! Though I am kind of disappointed with how the game turned out, I\u00a0am excited that I\u00a0have entered a new world of programming and hope to continue to learn about game dev in the future.</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>\n<p>Game was made with C# using MonoGame framework</p><p><strong>How to Install:</strong></p>\n<p>To play the game install the zip file and open the GoldenRa.exe :)</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Move the player with A and D</p>\n<p>After the game ends, press R to go back to the main menu</p><p>Dodge the anvils, you win when the timer hits 0</p>\n<p>Don't forget to have fun ;) .. also don't get hit lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T10:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ffdd353887b7817685bfb03ba9d4bbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mjmakesgames03"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
