The game is still at\u00a0 it's early development stage. The version that you will be downloading is the first playable version of the game consisting of 3 levels; a tutorial, a jump puzzle challenge and finally a boss level. The story aspect of the game is not available yet. I have uploaded this version of the game to get feedback on core gameplay elements, enjoyability, difficulty, and bug reports.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Menu Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys Up and Down</p>\n<p>Enter</p>\n<p><strong>In Game Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>W - Jump\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Left Click - Quick Attack</p>\n<p>D - Move Right\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Right Click - Heavy Attack</p>\n<p>A - Move Left\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Space - Slide\u00a0</p>\n<p>G - Throw Knife\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0E - Interact/ Talk to</p>\n<p>Esc - Pause</p>\n<p><strong>Donations:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is absolutely free to play and the newer versions that will be added later will also be free. I have not decided on whether the final product will be free or for a small sum (min 1$, max 5$). In under no circumstances are you forced to pay for the versions leading up to the final product nor will you have to donate in order to play them. If you would like to donate and support this product, I thank you in advance. The money from the donations will ONLY BE USED TO IMPROVE THE GAME and nothing else. Depending on the amount of donations, I will invest in better artwork, cinematics and etc. All to make the game more enjoyable to the player.</p>\n<p><strong>A Small Favor:</strong></p>\n<p>If you will be downloading the game, I would absolutely LOVE your feedback. Whether it is positive or negative please do not hesitate to leave a comment or thread. You may also email me at DeveloperJhin@gmail.com for any inquiries or if you would like to send me your feedback there. I accept feedback from everyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would absolutely love it as well if you could send videos of yourselves playing the game. I would love to see your genuine reactions while playing it. ESPECIALLY your frustration... and trust me you will get frustrated playing this game. It is not easy by any means.</p>\n<p><strong>Competition:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I believe this game is extremely tough, so I will be leaving a\u00a0competitive section\u00a0in which players can\u00a0 partake in. The first person to beat this version (Remember it is only 3 Levels) will be able to choose one option from a list of rewards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These rewards consist of:</p>\n<p>1) Voice Acting a character in the game.</p>\n<p>2) Having an Easter Egg dedicated to the winner (Can be whatever they want as long as it is not offensive to anyone or inappropriate).</p>\n<p>3) Have a character based on them. (Their physical description made into a 2D character).</p>\n<p>For the first 10 to beat the game they will receive a free copy of the game when the game is fully released (If this game ends up being a paid game) and will also have a section in the credits thanking them for their participation and as well congratulating them.</p>\n<p>In order to prove that you have completed the game I ask for a screenshot of the last mysterious figure (You will know when).
