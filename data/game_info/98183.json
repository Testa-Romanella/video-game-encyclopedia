You play as\u00a0a\u00a0detective who must find a stolen prototype of the first quantum locomotive. The set is\u00a0an abandoned station taken over by squats</strong></p>\n<p>The game works right in your browser, and saves progress automatically so that you don't have to start from scratch. You will be asked to play in fullscreen. It's your choice, but the experience is much better in fullscreen (and landscape, if you play from mobile). You can change your mind anytime during gameplay, since there will be a button to switch fullscreen mode in the top-right corner.</p>\n<p><strong>Game mechanics</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Play by using the mouse or a touch screen.</li><li>Make your avatar (Justin) walk by clicking on empty space (where there are no interactive objects).\u00a0</li><li>You interact with objects and people by clicking on them.\u00a0</li><li>The bar at the bottom of the screen is the inventory, that is the list of objects you have collected so far. You can use them or give them to people by dragging them and dropping on the target.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Specs</strong></p>\n<p>The game should run fine in any modern hardware and browser. It has been tested with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, although I added some workarounds for IE11 too.</p>\n<p>The game might need around 512MB of RAM for all the graphics in some scenes, so if you are running on a mobile device, you are better off with a minimum of 1GB of RAM on it, since there are other things competing with that RAM, like the OS.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical details</strong></p>\n<p>The game has been written in Typescript, without using any pre-existing gaming library. An in-depth article can be found here.</p>\n<p>All graphics have been created with blender, in 3D, and pre-rendered as 2D images. More details in this article.</p>\n<p>Sprites are packed in sprite sheets, and converted to indexed PNGs, which loses some quality but saves a lot of bandwidth.</p>\n<p><strong>Press</strong></p>\n<p>Here is a press kit.</p>\n<p><strong>Extended Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>My name is Ruben Lopez, you can find me on twitter, and I authored most of the game.</li><li>Jorge Fuentes authored some of the graphics, the logo, polished most scenes, and provided UX, visual design and video editing consulting. I wish I had the time to include all his recommendations!</li><li>I found all the audio in freesound.org, and edited most samples to tweak them a bit. The majority of the samples are CC0, a couple are CC-BY and are explicitly listed in the credits section within the game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Thanks</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Silvia Izquierdo for her infinite patience and support during the last 10 months of extra work after my main job.</li><li>Fran Krause,\u00a0Dariush Derakhshani and\u00a0Th\u00e9otime Vaillant for their awesome coursera specialization on game design. It was the spark I needed to start creating this game.</li><li>All the Alpha and Beta testers who provided super useful feedback. The list is too long to include it here, but I remember each one of you and tried my best to act on your feedback.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fe/6fe9ba3eb50ba91b0329653cc666004b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rub\u00e9n L\u00f3pez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
