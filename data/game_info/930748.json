Time stays paused while you aren't moving, acting, or passing time on purpose. The world is a single endless map, with more powerful enemies and items as you travel further from where you started. Instead of tiles, you are allowed 360 degrees of movement for any distance you want.</p>\n<p>Think of this as a top-down \"Superhot Survivors\" with weapons that can upgrade over the course of the run.<br/><br/>Try to win at the highest challenge level you can, and let me know your thoughts in the comments.
