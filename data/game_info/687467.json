{"id": 687467, "slug": "rocko-raids-the-necromancers-castle", "name": "Rocko Raids the Necromancer's Castle", "name_original": "Rocko Raids the Necromancer's Castle", "description": "<p><em>A short but challenging bullet hell where you must sacrifice power-ups for health<br/></em></p>\n<p>This game was made for the 2021 Spooktober Jam for the theme \"sacrifice\". It was done over 7 days by a solo developer (hi, my name's Josh) with the exception of the large drawings of rocko, which were drawn by my friend Alex (thanks for the help Alex, nice work). This is the first whole game i've ever made, and i am exceptionally unexceptional when it comes to artwork, so you'll have to forgive the look (and complete lack of audio, sorry). I've also had to\u00a0slash and burn\u00a0eye-wateringly large amounts trim parts of the game for the sake of time, so the game is really just one boss fight instead of a sequence of levels. I also only have 7 rune stone types; ideally i would have had many compex runes that interact with different game mechanics instead of just changing stats (like comparing the Rune of Greed to the Rune of Power). I had to cut interesting runes like the Rune of Blood, which would have created an explosion when sacrificed but cost energy instead of giving it. Maybe one day i'll incorporate the system into another game (or finish this one) so let me know of any ideas or critiques.</p>\n<p>The game is centered around collecting rune stones to gain powers and defeat the evil necromancer and his hordes of undead. The only problem is that Rocko needs to eat rocks or he'll fall asleep, so you need to\u00a0<strong>sacrifice</strong> your runestones to keep playing. the controls are simple,\u00a0<strong>wasd to move</strong> and\u00a0<strong>arrow keys to aim and fire</strong>. The complexity comes from the different runestones, it's important to know which ones to keep and which ones to sacrifice. You also have to make the decision quick because every second you delay is second closer to Rocko falling asleep\u00a0(and losing).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Runes</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Patience runes slow down your shots but add a ricochet to your shot</li><li>Power runes double your damage in exchange for slowing down your shots</li><li>Precision runes double your shot speed, give them a trail, and increase your fire rate slightly</li><li>Haste runes increase your speed but decrease your damage</li><li>Fear runes allow you to fire 2 additional scatter shots at the cost of halving your fire rate</li><li>Greed runes fire one gold shot for each rune you equipped beforehand (to the left) so equip these last\u00a0</li><li>Abundance runes double the scatter shots and gold shots you fire, but are useless if you dont have any</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Some advice</strong><br/>The necromancer will become more and more dangerous as you damage him, so set yourself up a bit killing zombies and skeletons for runes before you lay into him too hard.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>References<br/></strong>Most assets i made myself, but these i used for free (except for the coffee i owe\u00a0Alex).
