{"id": 614699, "slug": "ants-itch-sidneys1", "name": "Ants (itch) (Sidneys1)", "name_original": "Ants (itch) (Sidneys1)", "description": "<p>Today, you make the decisions!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Each level contains a randomly generated playing field, goal and, potentially, adversaries, and is generally more difficult than the last.</p>\n<p>You as the player coordinate Ant\u2019s queue of Jobs. Each Job has a priority (e.g., \u201cx2\u201d) and idling Ants will randomly select a Job from the list. Higher priority Jobs have a higher chance of being selected. To create Jobs, see the Controls section below.</p>\n<p>Anthills can be given tasks such as creating more Ants, or stockpiling Food. To change an Anthill\u2019s task, select it and see the (C)reate and (S)tockpile controls below. Creating more Ants consumes 20 food every 3 seconds as long as the Anthill has at least 25 Food stored.</p>\r\nSandbox Mode\r\n<p>Unfortunately I was unable to finish this game fully in time. Notable planned features that didn\u2019t make it are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More game goals than just \u201cnumber of ants\u201d and \u201cstockpile of food\u201d.</li>\n<li>Enemy Ant colonies with complex AI.</li>\n<li>The ability to build new Anthills and other structures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For now I\u2019ve worked this around into more of a \u201csandbox\u201d that you can enable with F5. Sandbox disables the Win/Lose conditions and allows you to freely place certain objects, as well as spawn in more Ants. You can spawn Fire Ants (enemies), however they won\u2019t do anything besides attack your anthills.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESC\r\nExit the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter\r\nSkip cutscenes.\r\n\r\n\r\nF1\r\nEnable debug overlay.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia-Previous/F2\r\nPrevious music track.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia-Next/F3\r\nNext music track.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia-PlayPause/F4\r\nPlay/Pause music track.\r\n\r\n\r\nF11\r\nToggle fullscreen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTab\r\nSelect next Anthill or Ant.\r\n\r\n\r\nH\r\nSelect next Ant(h)ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\nSelect next (A)nt.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nSelect next (i)dle Ant.\r\n\r\n\r\nF\r\nSelect next (F)ood item.\r\n\r\n\r\nG\r\nCreate Job to (G)ather Food.
