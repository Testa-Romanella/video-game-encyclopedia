After a long battle with the ZeR0 forces, he managed to escape, but his ship was destroyed. After drifting through space for a few days, he has crash-landed on a small nearby planet. The ship is totally wrecked. Dante needs tools to fix the ship and escape from this planet. But not all is bad news, in the area where it has crashed there is a hangar where you could find what you need and a strange vehicle at the door that may help you in your search.</p>\n\n<p>VoxelTower 2020.
