Failing to fall on the proper side or falling out will result in you being returned to the last place you were.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for exactly three hours for TriJam 18.</p><p>You can pass the whole game, but there is no finish screen -- the last level repeats forever. Keep in mind that you might need a fair amount of luck before the physics engine lets you pass -- took me around 20 minutes to pass all the levels.<br/><br/>Warning: there are a few places where you can get stuck without being able to jump. There is no way to get out of them without restarting the whole game.
