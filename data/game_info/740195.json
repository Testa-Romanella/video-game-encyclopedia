The doorway leading to SCP-087 is constructed of reinforced steel with an electro-release lock mechanism. It has been disguised to resemble a janitorial closet consistent with the design of the building. The lock mechanism on the doorknob will not release unless [REDACTED] volts are applied in conjunction with counter-clockwise rotation of the key. The inside of the door is lined with 6 centimeters of industrial foam padding.</p>\n<p>Descend places you in the shoes of a D-Class personnel exploring SCP-087. You will descend the stairs in an unsettling atmosphere until you find more information about the SCP...if you find any. You will explore, look, listen, and walk for as long as you can walk. </p>\n<p>This game is still early in development and we are planning on adding more mechanics such as stamina and hunger and the need to replenish those things.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad799f715021421ad531ffd775a9ace0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["UnexampledSalt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
