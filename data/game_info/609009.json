The design, programming and production of the game was also a mostly solo endeavour.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T06:06:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50d/50dbe838aede9cd930442478a89c7034.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Joe George"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
