Koodos to anyone who makes an A.I. that can play either of them or both! The Intro platformer is just something I did to say hi as this is a new field of genre for me to be making but anywho enough talking your head off enjoy the game/challenges!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T06:50:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfa91c39a3b44589f3996795c576a976.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarainia"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
