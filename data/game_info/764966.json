Use your Alchemical Powers to survive being roasted by every evil diety you can think of! By mastering the elements and their combinations you'll be able to roast, freeze, shock, or just outright obliterate all your enemies! That is, assuming they don't kill you first. Throughout the game, the player will be prompted to fight the undead, pirates, ghosts, mummies, and so much more! Once you gain enough XP, you can make your individual elements stronger using the skill points you acquire, and then combine those elements to create even stronger combinations. All eight worlds are procedurally generated, allowing for endless unique worlds and boss dimensions for the player to enjoy! Be careful though, if your character dies it's permanent! For the best odds of defeating the forces of evil, team up with your friends and raid the boss dimensions together! Make sure you and your team stay on their toes though, Deities each have their own special attacks that could affect the player in a variety of ways...<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>     PermaDeath<br/>Play carefully!
