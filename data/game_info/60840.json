We've taken topographic data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Laser Altimeter (LOLA) which is mounted on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) to create this 3d map for you to explore. <br/><br/>You and your character can view in first-person or third-person perspective as you explore:<br/><ul><li>Begin at the the Starter Arena, along the southern rim of Moltke AC Crater as you learn the fundamentals of Jet-Packing in the Moon's low gravity environment.<br/></li><li>Explore Hypatia Rille and visit nearby Moltke A Crater and the highlands south of the Sea of Tranquility.<br/></li><li>Walk or Jet-pack down into the enormous Moltke Crater which is about 6 kilometers across.<br/></li><li>Head north to visit the Tranquility Base Lunar Reserve Visitor Center, gateway to the Apollo 11 landing site. Head further north to Collins Crater, or the east to see Armstrong Crater or to the far west to visit Aldrin Crater, all named after the Apollo 11 astronauts.</li></ul><br/>There is so much more to see and explore. You'll see just how beautiful the Moon actually is up close and personal, from the vast Sea of Tranquility to the highlands and mountains in the south.<br/><br/>View an in-game picture map of the game area:<br/>https://partner.steamgames.com/gfxproxy/gfx/apps/873740/extras/Map2.png?t=1532636576<br/><br/><strong>Welcome to Tranquility Base Mining Colony: The Moon - Explorer Version.
