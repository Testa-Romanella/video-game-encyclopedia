In the (dis)comfort of your very own angry head.</em></p>\n\n<p>Expiate\u00a0follows the dreams of Corbin,\u00a0who accesses his subconscious by dozing off to the static sound and visuals of his television screen. It gets predictably surreal from there. You can choose to lead him to the darkest pits of his mind... or just break a bunch of stuff with a metal baseball bat. Either way, something or someone's gonna get beaten up.</p>\n<p>Expiate is a mostly traditional Yume Nikki fangame,\u00a0with some slight alterations to the formula. Effects are a part of the game, but collecting them is not your main focus. Instead, use effects and explore to look for strange objects located around the dreamworld.\u00a0Gather these items in order to progress.</p>\n<p>=====<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features - v.0.1</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Four ??? objects to collect.</li><li>Six fully implemented effects, all of which have a different purpose. (Around ten in total are planned for the game.)</li><li>Four events to trigger.</li><li>Dreamworld that alters to varying degrees\u00a0as you progress. (This will be more prominent in future versions of the game.)</li><li>Eight nexus worlds, plus an additional eight main deeper locations. (Not all nexus worlds currently lead to other worlds.)</li><li>Beat stuff up. Kick people around. It's a fun time... for Corbin, anyway.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9dc357234438a27c8bcdd097e8b419e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["P0lter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
