That makes the project by far my most popular. Thank you so much for the support. So as promised... Bloons Tower Defense 2 is here! Now with 3 new maps - easy, medium and hard, 1 new tower type, some new upgrades, and brand new on track placeable items, monkey glue, and road spikes. To challenge you there are 2 new bloon types. Have fun passing all 50 levels! Version History: Version 3.1 (final update) Version 3.1 - White bloon pathing on Medium Track fixed. (11/1/23) Version 3.0 - Boomerang has been quite buffed since it's my favourite tower and I want everyone else to love it too. Boomerang projectile size increased by 5%. Base pierce increased from 3 to 4. (11/12/22) Version 2.9 - A cheat button to unlock all medals instantly? (26/11/22) Version 2.8 - Removed pierce cap for supermonkey. (19/11/22) Version 2.7 - Addition of the music button with the beats from my BTD 1 game (overall louder now). Bombs size capping is now less drastic. (12/11/22) Version 2.6 - Round button glitch fixed. (11/11/22) Version 2.5 - Boomerang accuracy greatly increased. Credits to @MISTERMASTER77 for this. (3/11/22) Version 2.4 - The supermonkey now shoots must faster from every 0.05 seconds to 0.03! Pierce capping late game has gone up significantly too making late game harder. Finally fixed visual bug where long range spikey balls appear affordable even when you don't have enough money to purchase it. (29/10/22) Version 2.3 - Save button now shows the correct save code without semi-colon and equal sign. Medals now no longer show when you restart and play another game. (25/10/22) Version 2.2 - Spikey Ball Tower and heavy duty spikey balls' pierce has decreased by 1. Shoots every 1.4 seconds instead of every second making it a medium speed shooting tower (previously fast). (21/10/22) Version 2.1 - Simplified saving system to not include the save code + ;=. Now the saving system responds more quickly and is overall more reliable. (21/10/22) Version 2.0 - Addition of the spikey ball shooter. The tower is expensive but powerful lategame. With two upgrades, heavy duty makes the projectiles larger and more pierce. Long range gives the tower more range. Many bug fixes also included because adding a new tower creates many annoying bugs. XD (17/10/22) Version 1.9 - Monkey Glue can now glue an extra bloon. (17/10/22) Version 1.8 - Fixed some glitches with the Dart Monkey upgrading system and sell button will not appear if you deselect a tower. (17/10/22) Version 1.7 - Fixed bug where the sell button would appear if user places down road items. (17/10/22) Version 1.6 - Boomerang projectile has greatly increased from size from 85% - 100%. (12/10/22) Version 1.5 - This update sees increases in attack speed to multiple towers: 1. Boomerang attacks every second instead of every 1.2 seconds. 2. Tack shooter now shoots every 1.5 seconds instead of 2 seconds. Faster shooting now 1.25 seconds instead of 1.75 seconds. 3. Supermonkey now attacks every 0.03 seconds instead of every 0.05 seconds. 4. Dart monkeys now shoot every 0.4 seconds instead of every 0.5 seconds. I'm hoping for this to make hard less impossible but it still is insanely difficult so if you do attempt it, then good luck! :D (9/10/22) Version 1.4 - Changed original Bloons Tower Defense 2 thumbnail to current. This matches the style of my first BTD thumbnail and I hope it works in helping get views successfully as my first one. (8/10/22) Version 1.3 - This update is big including multiple bug fixes (still bugs present, sadly...) and a brand new feature added to the game! :) 1. The selling button has been introduced. Now you have the ability to sell any tower placed down! However, you don't get 100% sell value so sell wisely! 2. When you press the green flag when bloons are spawning. The projects restarts as normal but frequent timed popping sounds can be heard. This is now removed (sound bug). 3. Cannon attack speed increased from shooting once a second to every 0.65 seconds making it more strong. 4. Bomb size decreased from 35% - 30% Bigger bomb size decreased from 50% - 40% 5. White bloon speed has decreased from 4 to 3.8. 6. This has led to very slight tweaks to the pathway that bloons follow. 7. Changed boomerang monkey's design slightly. This update took some time but I am happy because it is a weight now off my shoulders. (8/10/22) Version 1.2 - Created Saving System to save medal progress, make sure you save your code somewhere so you do not lose your medal progress. Previous system was cloud based and simply did not work. (2/10/22) Version 1.1 - Decreased Code Bug where spawned bloons fly across the map, chances have now significantly decreased for all maps. (2/10/22) Version 1 - Game released. (2/10/22)</p>\r\nNotes and Credits\r\n<p>Thank you so much for making this game #1 trending tower defense game!!! :D This game is made by ninjakiwi. I simply made this game on scratch. As this project is new, there will probably be bugs that need fixing. Any bugs present, let me know in the comments so I can fix them ASAP thanks!!! :D Credits: I would like to thank Warframe and Shiftclicklearn for their helpful tower defense videos. They helped me create the wave spawn system, tower aiming, money/live system and even placing the towers. Invaluable information! Super Tower Defence Alpha v0.8 by AdamatheKing played a huge role. That let me create actual projectiles rather than using costumes from the towers. Code org producer for creating the code that allows me to make black, white bloons to spawn yellows, Leads to spawn blacks and rainbows to spawn blacks and whites! It's not perfect though hence bloons can fly across the screen. Sometimes fly to the back of the map! Be careful! Thanks to shiftclicklearn in creating the upgrading system. My one is heavily based on his. I would like to give all of these coders a big shout out as they really did make this project possible, I am no real coder just so you know just like the great majority of scratchers. I just work hard and never give up!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T10:04:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00e33cf1008a0b7fa1dfc2f6aaaf2025.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SamadiBeligaswatte1"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
