In that way, you will get that laser line to eventually hit its goal and you pass that level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFEATURES<br/>\r\nYou are in control of deciding where the reflection cubes will be placed. But there are some special cubes as well - like the ones that don't reflect at all or the ones that can not be moved around but are fixed in your polygon.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, activate your thinking, bring up some knowledge from your physics class and the laser party can begin.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ea/6eac7f1b70ea1d429ba8a2df94202e7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Airony"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
