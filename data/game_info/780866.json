For me, it meant that going out on simple errands suddenly felt much more significant, like I was making a journey across an alien planet, cut off from interacting with my fellow astronauts. In addition to this isolation, suddenly switching to having to wear a mask whenever I was outside the house would make me claustrophobic. This game intends to try and communicate these feelings of isolation, alienness, and claustrophobia to the player. \r\n</p>\n\n<p>Initially conceived as the prototype \"An Alien World\", I built upon the elements of isolation that I had first addressed and expanded it out to the full game \"New Normal\".</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>WSAD to move</strong></li><li><strong>E to interact</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Headphones recommended.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Assets Used:</p>\n<ul><li>Snaps Prototype - School : Unity Technologies\r\n</li><li>Simple Cars Pack : MyxerMan\r\n</li><li>QA Books : QAtmo\r\n</li><li>Horror Elements : Anthon\r\n</li><li>Horror Ambience : N91music\r\n</li><li>Ukulele : Bensound\r\n</li><li>Footsteps Essentials : Nox_Sound\r\n</li><li>Voices Essentials : Nox_Sound</li><li>Space Polygons - Lander Pack : PULSAR BYTES\r\n</li><li>Stylized Astronaut : PULSAR BYTES\r\n</li><li>SUPER Character Controller : Aedan Graves\r\n</li><li>The First Person : Breog\u00e1n Hackett\r\n</li><li>TV Set : Dmitriy Dryzhak\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T14:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/197/197084481e58c52174e445b81f9ced28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mttjns"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
