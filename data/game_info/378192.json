Much care has gone into the storytelling and also into the combat and the hand-crafted boss battles with the aim of providing the player with an all-around engaging experience. The story of Project Compass will gradually unfold as the player progresses through the game.</p>\n<p>The demo will take you through one chapter of Project Compass, and the main scenario will take a couple of hours to complete.\u00a0 There's also a healthy amount of additional content in the demo including a few secrets and optional, challenging boss fights for those who want to invest more time in the demo.</p>\n<p>Enjoy, and do give feedback if you feel like it! ;)<br/></p>\n<p>- Caerule<br/><br/>Additional info:<br/>- The game runs on Windows computers.<br/>- Parts of the  game contain references to and  depict the use of alcohol, and therefore the game may not be suitable for young children.
