It was created by a bunch of novice yet passionate UAS students with a grand vision which prevailed through both external and internal conflicts on its year-and-a-half development period. Institutional pressure forced the team\u00a0to deliver a complete commercial product for student-led publisher company which sadly led to compromises in its depth of content and level of polish. It was both a traumatic and extremely stressful experience for everyone involved while still serving as invaluable experience.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game's publishing and intellectual rights have been lost through acts\u00a0of incompetence and misunderstandings on behalf of both development team and the publisher, and as such\u00a0the\u00a0 dev team won't get a cent out of present and future Steam sales. This platform was re-opened in a good faith\u00a0only to preserve the legacy of a project that consumed blood, sweat and tears - in memory of good times together, working on a game that we were all proud of.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>//<em>Also, since the game hasn't\u00a0ever included any DRM, there have been circulating cracked and shady copies of the game on the web ever since it was originally released. Hopefully this will save anyone of the trouble of having their computer in danger.</em></p>\n<p>Official product pages can still be found at following sites:</p>\n<ul><li>Greenlight</li><li>Steam Store</li><li>Bandcamp</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f13/f137b3f9eafa332a87d5311cfd56107f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaaos"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
