It contains a variety of levels which give the gamer a different experience of driving. Each level is unique in its own ways. For example, on one level they may be long straights and you will be driving very fast and rapid in contrast to normal driving. On the other hand, on some levels you will experience sharp turns where you will need to decrease your speed to optimal levels. There will be a subtle amount of, Off road experience which will be revealed throughout the game.\u00a0<br/>There are five distinct cars included in this game. Each car has its own speed limits and different levels of enjoyment to the gamer. The speed from fast to slow varies on the different levels, depending on the surface the car is driving on. Moreover, the environment of each level is specific in its own way. On the dirt levels there\u2019s more traction on the ground in comparison to the desert levels which have less grip due to sand on the ground. the levels contain different trees and vegetation in the background which brings realism to the game.<br/>FEATURES:<br/>\u2022\tThere\u2019s five different cars<br/>\u2022\tThis game contains 10 useable levels<br/>\u2022\tThis game also uses wind physics<br/><br/>This is our first official public game on the play store and itch.io, so any constructive criticism will be appreciated, you can send it to wreckitgamessupp@gmail.com.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Made By:<br/>Hamzah<br/>Awais<br/>Shomail<br/><br/>SPECIAL THANKS TO:<br/>Unity3D<br/>Microsoft Visual Studio\u00a0<br/><br/>Thanks for downloading<br/>TRACKLAND<br/>Have a NICE TIME PLAYING ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/379/3798261e761fc4eae95f354d655f62fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wreck-It Games"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
