Watch them from a bird\u2019s eye view as they roll and fall, bouncing around <strong>gorgeous landscapes recorded in 4K resolution by award-winning filmmaker Olli Huttunen, </strong>with no loading times between screens.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your idea will get stuck every now and then \u2013 houses, guardrails, or even trees can become a barrier. But twice per screen, <strong>you can help it out and clear its way,</strong> so it can keep advancing. Who knows where your idea may arrive\u2026?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sometimes, your idea will end its journey without reaching its destination \u2013 but it can help other people\u2019s ideas in the future, or even yourself. <strong>Write a thought, a piece of a song, a verse</strong> -- and <strong>share it. </strong>Now is out there, forever, for all the world to see. <br/><br/><br/><br/>And when you begin a new journey, you\u2019ll see <strong>other people\u2019s ideas. Save your favorite ones, </strong>and see how many people have saved yours. Enjoy this journey accompanied by a charming, soothing original soundtrack, in this game inspired by the award-winning short film IDEA, by Olli Huttunen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Explore gorgeous landscapes in 4K, captured with a drone by an award-winning filmmaker, with no loading times between screens<br/></li><li>Spark an idea, represented by a white lightbulb, that will begin bouncing down the hard edges of every screen until it gets stuck <br/></li><li>Twice per screen, when your lightbulb is stuck you can push it away from an obstacle, so it can continue its journey <br/></li><li>Share your ideas: if your lightbulb doesn't reach the end of the screen, you'll be able to leave a message that other players will see when they pass near the that spot<br/></li><li>Save your favorite ideas, and see how many people have saved yours<br/></li><li>Getting Steam achievements will unlock new icons for you to use in your messages <br/></li><li>If your lightbulb is still moving when the music ends, it reaches its destination, unlocking pieces of visual arts for your gallery</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T07:56:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1eefa9465bf16200deed56282131e583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 556, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TLR Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["IndieArk", "Shinyuden", "TLR Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
