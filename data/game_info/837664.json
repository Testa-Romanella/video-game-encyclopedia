I wanna make a game that people would play so I made a proto, please comment here what you like or dislike about the game cuz I wanna know if investing time into this is worth it. note that the game is only a short prototype and it has the bare minimum things in it but in a way that its playable. if people will like it ill finish and polish\u00a0it.</p><p>Your objective is simply to find the escape before its too late, while there is no timer your flashlight will eventually run out, you can turn it on/off with right mouse button to save power. You can look down to use your map,\u00a0shift to run and to exit the help window drag your cursor to the edge of your screen.</p><p>Also this was part of testing but press space if you wanna glitch the game for fun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T16:29:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/469/469f9966bbafc1a7a29a686e65bb5459.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kriss46"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
