It will always be completely free, with no ads, no cash shop, and no invasion of your privacy. After losing access to the source code, I've decided to release the price restriction for the premium version. No more themes will be developed, but you can now access all of them for free if you choose. You can think of SCOOP as Donation-ware. You can pay what you want to help a struggling developer, but you will always be able to play the entire game for free.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGameplay footage provided by \r\n\tPvMPAndang<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<br/>\n<strong>What's New in SCOOP 0.1.4.0?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved graphics pipeline for better performance.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\n<li>Dual analog controls on a gamepad.
