Molding machines\u00a0must be equipped with a certain mold platen (each platen outputs a certain shape). Different parts (or bricks) then have to be gathered and placed\u00a0into cardboard boxes to be sold.</p>\n<p>Regarding mechanics, you do not control the employees directly. You\u2019d just set the layout and watch them work. My main inspirations would be:</p>\n<ul><li>Oxygen Not Included</li><li>Theme Hospital</li><li>Satisfactory</li><li>Hydroneer</li></ul>\r\nStatus\r\n<p>The game is\u00a0<strong><em>still </em></strong><em><strong>very much in a prototyping phase</strong></em> and there is currently very little do to, but I'm actively working on it (although not full time, I\u00a0also have a job) and will update new versions on regular basis.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0understand it might still\u00a0look a bit confusing and sometimes over-complicated. The plan right now is to add all features I have in mind\u00a0and focus primarily\u00a0on some kind of sandbox mode, with all the features and units unlocked.\u00a0Later I'm planning to\u00a0add some kind of scenario or progression, a tech tree,\u00a0as well as different difficulty/complexity levels;\u00a0that hopefully will make it more accessible.</p>\n<p>I'm documenting my progress on YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGXcftbJDa8&amp;list=PLyjeXbaiPfA2uuJAjYTWjDRWQjBxkW-cA</p>\n\n<p>It should be possible to run the Linux version on Mac too, but I haven't tested myself.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:29:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed8511bcaf0ed150ab4a0221dd4351c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["benckx"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
