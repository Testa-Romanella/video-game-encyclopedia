{"id": 900936, "slug": "infinity-tower", "name": "Infinity Tower", "name_original": "Infinity Tower", "description": "<p>Welcome to the prologue of our\u00a0newest action RPG game, currently in early alpha development. In the prologue section of the\u00a0game, you'll take on the role of a yet-to-be, powerful fire knight, tasked with defeating hordes of enemies on the Island of Trials. Armed with your trusty weapons and powerful magic, you'll need to use all of your skills and cunning to survive in this dangerous world.</p>\n\n<p>During combat, you'll have the opportunity to collect magic relics that will help boost your character's abilities and make you even more powerful. With each victory, you'll become stronger and more skilled, slowly becoming a true force to be reckoned with.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a single-player adventure, where you are the hero of your own story. With intense battles and the ability to collect powerful relics, this game offers a unique and exciting experience: powerful relics are also given to the monsters,\u00a0not only the hero!\u00a0<br/></p>\n\r\nWhy prologue?\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>We aim to build a prologue to our game first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This will allow us to\u00a0iterate faster and get insights from our player base about the game early on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently, the game features our latest implementation of a combat and relics system - pillars that we also plan to use in the final game.</p>\n<p>Currently, game builds do not contain a lot of content, but we plan to add it, to build up the prologue until it will become a fully-fledged representation of what we have in mind for the full game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By joining\u00a0the alpha, you can help shape the game's development and make your voice heard. We really look forward to your feedback!</p>\n<p>Stay tuned and look for updates either on itch.io our devlog or other social media.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>gbrosgames.com\u00a0|\u00a0twitter\u00a0| instagram</strong></p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>fast-paced action combat</li><li>level up your hero to gain powerful relics</li><li>magic relics can influence character statistics, grant new or enhance existing skills</li><li>mouse and keyboard or pad\u00a0support</li></ul>\n\r\nMinimum recommended specs\r\n<ul><li>OS:\u00a0Windows 10<br/>\n</li><li>Processor:\u00a02.5Ghz or better<br/>\n</li><li>Memory:\u00a04 GB RAM<br/>\n</li><li>Storage: at least 1 GB of available space\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T10:16:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8e/e8e806ee807060c8b9638415f2b4719a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GbrosGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
