You\u2019ll lose yourself in settings inspired by the works of poets Keats, Byron, and Shelley, and use the game's system of writing prompts to help create your own masterpieces.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore 27 different writing challenges, through which you create narratives about the worlds you visit, from multiple perspectives. In one challenge, you play an archaeologist, uncovering clues and writing about a city's final days; in another, you're a thief, composing a song about searching the wreckage for valuables; and in another, you're a bard penning a lament in rhyming couplets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The developers created Elegy to share the joy of creative expression -- ideally, they want to give non-writers an environment in which they can tell stories. With visuals inspired by Romantic painter J. M. W. Turner, the game provides a playground for individual imagination, and a community where everyone is an artist. Elegy's developers, Dejobaan Games and Popcannibal, are leaving the discussion of what art or a game is to critics, and merely asking gamers, \"What will you write?\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>When you've finished writing a story, share it with other players via Steam Workshop; then read others' works, and commend your favorites.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T06:31:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/8011db10fbb1491829fc0c2b91d966c6.jpg", "website": "http://elegyforadeadworld.com", "rating": 2.47, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 21, "owned": 403, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dejobaan Games", "Popcannibal"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dejobaan Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
