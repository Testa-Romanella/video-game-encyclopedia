If you want to wishlist the game please make sure to do so here:https://store.steampowered.com/app/1125710/<br/><br/>Gatewalkers is a cooperative survival game with action RPG elements, where players travel across different worlds in order to save their own. Explore procedurally generated worlds, face hostile inhabitants, face challenges like extreme weather conditions, toxic atmosphere, lack of water and more.<h3>Key features:</h3><h3>TEAM CO-OP</h3><br/>As a Gatewalker, one of the chosen few, you can go through the Gate and explore the worlds that lay on the other side. Team up with up to 3 other players in this team-based survival. Fight terrifying monsters, survive extreme weather conditions, follow the orders given by the Guild, and most importantly, stay alive!<br/><h3>WORLD EXPLORATION</h3> <br/>Explore the procedurally generated worlds with unique terrain features, plants, and creatures. Discover new resources and crafting materials. Face various environmental hazards: toxic or unbreathable atmosphere, terrifying darkness, penetrating cold, and much more. Each world type introduces a unique survival mechanic that forces you to adapt. Finding food, water or wood to start a fire may be impossible. Consider carefully what to bring with you on the expedition, as no one really knows what  awaits on the other side of the Gate.<h3>TEAM SURVIVAL</h3><br/>Surviving alone in an unknown world is really hard. But with teammates at your side, you at least stand a chance. Share the responsibilities: start a fire to let others warm up, build a tent to let your mates rest, warn them about the dangers lurking in the night. The key to surviving is cooperation between you and your team.<h3>SKILL BASED COMBAT</h3><br/>Isometric skill-based combat without auto targeting. Your skills may miss, and you can dodge enemy attacks! Good positioning during combat, balanced use of skills, proper timing and team synergy are all crucial to victory.<h3>CRAFTING</h3><br/>Choose an item to craft. Discover the appropriate recipe. Raid different worlds to gather required resources. Find or create a crafting station. Finally, build the item and use it!<h3>YOU ARE WHAT YOU WEAR</h3><br/>There are no predefined character classes. Each item gives you a unique set of skills, so try tinkering with different builds. Take heavy armor and a healing staff to support your mates in the front line by tanking and restoring health. Remember, you are, what you wear!<h3>PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLDS</h3><br/>Each time you pass the Gate you will land in a different, procedurally generated world. This gives you countless opportunities, offers constant challenges, and forces you to adapt in order to win in changing conditions! Always stay cautious, modify your strategy, make fast decisions and face their consequences, because you never know what waits around the corner.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T19:35:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d2/9d2b7e5d595ed50247e03077bfff0a26.jpg", "website": "https://gatewalkers.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 584, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A2 Softworks"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["A2 Softworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
