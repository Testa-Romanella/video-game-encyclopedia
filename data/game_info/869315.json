The core gameplay mechanic is for the player to push the dart up in order to hit one of the targets once the player loses control to gravity. Everytime a target is hit the targets move to a random spot on the screen. The player can control the dart up until it touches the white line. The game is over when the player misses with their dart. A yellow target is 10 points, red is 5 points, and blue is 1 point. The white line disappears once the player gets past a minute of playtime.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T14:26:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a17abbf2ca9e08bb9a2bca80f538626a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Evan Lew"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
