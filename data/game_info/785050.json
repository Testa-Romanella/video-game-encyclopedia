Especially in this day when there are many ways to use time. We don't really have a good relationship with our media consumption. For example, before going to bed, we use many devices with blue light, which is bad for our sleep hygiene.\r\n</p>\n<p>Also, in this game, Princess Insomania can't fall asleep because of her cell phone. It keeps her awake. She sees the new song on her homescreen and then automatically goes to social media. As she scrolls through the page, an error pops up. She needs to turn off her device. But it's not as quick and easy as she thought.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T15:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/789/789ec87f9042629991d2726430c0f174.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["noaseh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
