Now with years of experience under her belt, she is an expert in all things food industry and has the confidence and leadership skills to boot.</p>\n<p>Although friendly, she tends to hold everyone to a high standard. She sometimes comes into conflict with those who disagree with her, but she always forgives and moves on.</p>\n\n<p>Lily only started working at the bistro a few months ago. She joined at a weird time, when the management and work conditions were beginning to reach an all-time low.
