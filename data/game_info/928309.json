It's an endless space shooter, and although it's missing a bunch of key features (score, levels, etc.), it was a great learning experience and still kind of fun to play for a couple minutes!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Space to shoot</li><li>E to switch weapon type</li><li>Q to use super laser</li><li>Escape to quit the game because I was too lazy to add in a pause screen haha</li></ul>\n<p>You'll notice the exe is called Interstellar Pizza, which is funny because the game has absolutely nothing to do with pizza. At the time, I was a gig driver for a food delivery app, and I was planning on creating a full game with a story about how the gig economy sucks. The main character was going to be a pizza delivery boy in the future with each level being a different delivery.\u00a0Ultimately, I decided the idea wasn't fun enough to make a whole game for (and that I also was too inexperienced), but I'm glad I still have the prototype!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T21:53:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dda/dda55a45a4ba4f6ac9cf35c9101a1f42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Nolatron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
