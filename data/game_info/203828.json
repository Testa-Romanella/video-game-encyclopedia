Destroy as many blocks as you can, you only have so many tries. We might even give you an extra go if you can clear a stage.<br/>Also, the AI that tracks your progress has been heard to disrupt the training course of those who don't fare so well..

Until then, just do what you can.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c970c28a817e5dbe997b662aecbb94f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MistRiven719"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
