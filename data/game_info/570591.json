With novel analytical insights on the system-part relationship of a maze, we design a Moving Maze that moves its parts methodically in response to the player\u2019s movement. A misorienting system composed of repetitive parts, the Moving Maze is deconstructed into the non-subdivisible unit, which can propagate into a field through replication and orthogonal rotation. The digital game generates unpredictable and interactive outcomes with fragmental movement using gamer-relational rules, in which the gamer achieves the joy of navigating through the intellectual discovery of the system\u2019s moving rules and smart rerouting. An art synthesizing procedural computation with gaming architecture, the Moving Maze pushes the imaginative boundary of what a maze can be and embodies the philosophy that systemic complexities arise from the simplest and most elementary things.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T06:02:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9e/b9ea4648865e4ae87d1b8d18db2354c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["y_w"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
