ASK YOUR FRIENDS TO WAR WITH YOU OR AGAINST YOU! <br/></p>\n<p>Rude Bear Raid is the 9th game in the Rude Bear megaseries (and the 8th one in Ludum Dare). <br/></p>\n<p>This game is an online multiplayer asynchronous war game between Bears and Boars. <br/>There are six classes to play as. <br/></p>\n<p>Your aim is to storm the enemy base and clamber into the core to get one of their precious points. <br/></p>\n<p>You'll have to face the Guardians of your online opponents though. Press x at any time to deploy a Guardian, and with it leave a hilarious message about how your team is vastly superior to your opponents. <br/></p>\n<p>To get through the base you have to capture rooms, by placing Guardians in them. <br/></p>\n<p>Then, you must battle your opponent's Guardians together to win. There are 6 types, 1 for each class. <br/></p>\n<p>You are the weapon. (And also you have some pretty gross weapons like faeces. And bacon). <br/></p>\n<p>Classes (which take this form): <br/></p>\n<p>NAME <br/>Mobility: How fast you move <br/>Primary weapon: What its effect is <br/>Guardian: What stuff is <br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------ <br/></p>\n<p>TEAM UNLIMITED RUDENESS (Rude Bear and Co): <br/></p>\n<p>BACONSTORM <br/>- Standard mobility. <br/>- Trigonometric bacon rifle: Assault rifle fires in waves and bounces. <br/>- Baconbot: A hunter that seeks boars. Follows them round and fires bacon at them. <br/></p>\n<p>GOURMET CHEF: <br/>- Limited Mobility, slower and less jumping. <br/>- Supercharging Hamspoker: A death laser. Hold down click for long enough and you can fry up some boars. <br/>- Pork Roaster: A spitroast of death lasers. A spinning death laser. <br/></p>\n<p>MENTAL RELAPSE: <br/>- Swift Hunter Reflexes, faster moving, you can launch yourself in the air by shooting down just after you jump too. <br/>- Psychic Truthballs: No one can avoid the truth. These explode into even more truth. <br/>- Glorious Protector: A golden statue of Rude Bear which sends out glorious protection balls which protect other units (and can make waterfalls of death). <br/></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------- <br/>INFINITE RADNESS SQUAD (Rad Boar and Co.): <br/></p>\n<p>LUDDITE: <br/>- Swinelike Mobility. You run like a pig. <br/>- Machine Maiming Magnum. This giant bullet from your trusty revolver will go right through any other bullets and do large damage. <br/>- Anti-Bacon Beacon. For anyone with the audacity to use bacon, this floating turret throws up food remains. <br/></p>\n<p>TABLE MANNERS: <br/>- Limited Mobility. You're holding a big gun. <br/>- Leftover Scattergun. This gun fires rotten food morsels. <br/>- Morsel Missile Launcher. This Bear-Seeking Missile Launcher will home in on Rude Bear with biological warfare and fire off old food. <br/></p>\n<p>HAMDEMIC: <br/>- Bubonic Hovering. This unit can run and fire at the floor to hover around. <br/>- Swine Flu \"Vaccinator\". Swine Flu follows you round and can be used as a shield, you can fly around with it, and you can edge around and take out units. <br/>- Well Hidden Trap. This machine fires faeces missiles at anyone who happens to come too close to it. Extremely dangerous. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls: <br/>WASD (and DVORAK/AZERTY equivalents): Walk. <br/>Space: Jump, and you can walljump up walls. <br/>X: Deploy a Guardian. <br/>Left click: Fire. <br/>Mouse: Aim and pan the camera. <br/>Typing: Leave hilarious messages for your opponents. <br/>----------- <br/>Code/Design: Alex Rose <br/>Graphics: Kitt Diamond (Bears/Backgrounds) and Simon Wong (Boars/Foregrounds) <br/>Music/SFX: Atmospherium</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T09:47:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec2/ec267c22fcdbf4acec1843f34763eeb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Rose"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
