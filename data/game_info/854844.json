It used to require a password, but I've since made the game open for all.\u00a0</p><p>The instructions should pop up when you load in, but in general, use your mouse to click the menus, Enter to move through conversations,\u00a0arrow keys to move when necessary, and space to start levels. Make sure to hit the blue Fullscreen button to render it properly!</p>\n<p>There are several levels that you can access.\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>Start Menu</li><li>Level Select/World Map</li><li>Levels 1-0 and 1-1 to the North (History)</li><li>Level 2-0 to the East (Design)</li></ol>\n<p>These playable levels are representative of proof of concept level designs for a longer project.\u00a0Currently, the game demo is designed for play with a mouse/keyboard in web browsers. Thanks in advance for your patience with any bugs or design issues, as this was created by a solo, first-time developer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please check out the full dissertation (click here) for a complete accounting of the project's aims, scopes, methodologies, and game design report.
