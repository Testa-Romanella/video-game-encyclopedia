The only sustainable source of grease in the known universe. Your task is simple. Get in. Get grease. Get out. You'll be against the clock, so don't get sluggish. But don't worry, you'll be going in armed with the very latest in grease aquisition hardware;</p>\n<p>First of all, the trusty Stun Orb [Designation \"Greaseball\"]. Aim well and connect with a little green foe to briefly stun them, leaving them wide open for 'harvesting' with use of your next tool...</p>\n<p>A goblin's grease may be extracted through a number of methods. The eggheads downstairs have recently been experimenting with a mix of hypnotherapy and blue laxative. But, while we wait for the goblin union to agree to a deal that is beneficial to both parties, we will have to stick to the old fashioned way. Grease is stored both in the intestines and pores of a goblin's skin. Great force applied straight down onto their heads acts as a simple and effective juicing technique. Use the Mallet [Designation \"No Deal\"] to get the job done.</p>\n<p>Finally, we've provided you with a tool to accumulate the crude grease and transport it safely to storage. It's a modified vacuum cleaner [Designation \"Grease Monkey\"], capable of chugging an unholy amount of grease without quibble. Its primary fire mode will suck up grease, while the alternate fire will spit it back out, preferably into the Barreloons we'll have on standby around the hot zone.</p>\n<p>Are we clear?</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move with 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D'</p>\n<p>Turn/Aim with Mouse</p>\n<p>Switch Tools with 'Q' and 'E'</p>\n<p>Hurl Stun Orb\u00a0 (L-Click)</p>\n<p>Whack with Mallet (Hold L-Click)</p>\n<p>Vacuum Up Grease (Hold L-Click)</p>\n<p>Eject Grease into Barreloons (Hold R-Click)</p>\n\n<p>Good luck, make our client proud.</p>\n<p>Grease Baron</p>\n<p>x</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Ed Hicks: Developer, Goblin Artist</p>\n<p>Joe McPhee: Designer, 3D Artist</p>\n<p>With help from;</p>\n<p>Turlough McHugh: Original Sound Track</p>\n<p>Links;</p>\n<p>Ed Hicks Itch.io;\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://matsuringo.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Joe McPhee Itch.io;</p>\n<p>https://noaveragej0e.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Turlough McHugh on Spotify;</p>\n<p>https://open.spotify.com/artist/1OHVBahhT5t5yuSEaX1arf<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:53:50", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NoAverageJ0E", "matsuringo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
