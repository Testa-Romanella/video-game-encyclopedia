{"id": 493258, "slug": "the-king-in-yellow-borders", "name": "The King in Yellow Borders", "name_original": "The King in Yellow Borders", "description": "<p>\"The King in Yellow\" is a collection of short stories by Robert Chambers, published in 1895.\u00a0\u00a0Many of the names, scenes, and themes in this game\u00a0are drawn from the first story, \"The Repairer of Reputations\",\u00a0as well as characters and events from throughout the collection.\u00a0 The unreliability of the narrator, especially as his side of the story cracks and slips further from 'reality', plays a central role, and I wanted the same to be true here. Gutenberg link to the original work is in the credits below.\u00a0 Thank you for playing.
