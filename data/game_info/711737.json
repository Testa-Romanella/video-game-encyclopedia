When you'd get a game over, the game freezes and goes into rewind mode. Use the left and right arrows to choose the moment to resume from, then press C to re-enter the game.</p>\n<p>You can adjust the game speed and rewind limit in the pause menu (Escape). If you happen to make a big mistake that isn't a game over, you can force a rewind from the pause menu too.<br/></p>\n<p>Individual game controls are displayed at the bottom of the frame. In some games, pressing and holding a key is different from tapping it quickly.</p>\n<p>We'll be adding more games, so check back later!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T06:37:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c7/8c7aaa1e612126f30114351d7b223545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["goodbunnystudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
