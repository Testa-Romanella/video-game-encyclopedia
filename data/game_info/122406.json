Try and figure out what's going on.</strong></p>\n<p>Hello! This is a game I made for the QRM jam / Queerly Represent Me's jam / \"Queerly Representing the Underrepresented\" (which seems to be the actual jam's name. It is based on dialogue I've had with friends since a short while.\u00a0It's been less than a month ago that this stuff really started for me, and it's rather personal. I don't really know if I should refer to the player character as \"you\" or \"me\" as a result.</p>\n<p>Walk around the cave and talk to the people there. Maybe they can help {you? me?} figure out what is going on.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Since I've not figured all this stuff out yet I have no idea what this (and I) exactly falls under. <strong>There's intimate/lewd-ish stuff in this. I hope you don't mind.\u00a0</strong>As is usual with jams this is unfinished, and also doesn't have as much *stuff* as I'd have liked. I did miss out on 2 of the jam's days. There's not much in the way of placeholders until you get to the post-convo options. Otherwise it's quite obvious the cave doesn't look much like a cave so far.</p>\n<p>The controls are explained in-game (and if you have trouble reading that text, the rest of the game is probably not going to fare well either) but regardless here they are again:</p>\n<p>WASD/ZQSD - move</p>\n<p>F - talk to NPCs</p>\n<p>G - end conversation</p>\n<p>Space - switch sex</p>\n<p>M - mute what little sound is there</p>\n<p>N - switch between QWERTY and AZERTY keyboard modes (game starts in WASD)</p>\n<p>R - reset game</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to GMS2's way of doing distribution (need a machine running the target OS for Linux or Mac. HTML5 export is prohibitively expensive for me) I can only offer a Windows build, but I also have uploaded the entire project source.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy this, in whatever way you do. Also let me know if you have any opinions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cd15b627b19c6d7f2daadd333bece12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BatElite"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
