If I'm able to finish developing this game, I will take a format name on it.</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Players have much moving speed and a little high flexibility.

Hitherto entire developing group is only myself.\r\n</p>\n<p>I design, I program, I draw, I model, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. When I got tired again, creativity follows and comes.\r\n</p>\n<p>Spirit can not be transfer to substance and fact directly, I'm facing concrete problems.\r\n</p>\n<p>I  didn't study art systematically. As you see, I designed 11 initial  weapons, while their models are all drafts now. No detail at all. I'm  using character models from Unreal Starter Projects and animation assets  from somewhere, which is mainly Mixamo. But only these assets can't support even quarter the system.\r\n</p>\n<p>If  nobody joins me, maybe I will turn to make character like Steve from  MC. I don't know whether you'll like it. Maybe yes, right?\r\n</p>\n<p>This is one of the major contradictions, I'm an undergraduate student, also facing some survival pressure from real world. <strong>BUT I will try my best to overcome all difficulties, until acquire success.\r\n<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>If you like this game too, let's wait it release.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T08:32:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98cfc4dfef318613e2338e882e8f0fd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BaituLime"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
