You explore the dungeon in classic roguelike fashion, with turn-based movement and lots of dice-rolling.</p>\n<p>This game was created for the 7DRL Challenge between March 6 and March 12, 2021. It demonstrates the combination of two genres into one game, but the scope is limited. Additional features such as new cards, ranged weapons, and better monster AI could be added in future work.</p>\n<p><em>Build and\u00a0Delve</em> is free software.
