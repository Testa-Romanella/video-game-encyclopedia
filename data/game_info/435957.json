To win a level, you have to advance forward and destroy the huge cowona, which creates lots of smaller cowonas. The lazor kills everything in line of sight, and you also don't have health and can't die. You have to destroy the cowonas ahead before they get behind you where they're harder to hit, and damage the truck.</p>\n<p>Tips:<br/></p><ul><li>The lazor is more accurate when you stand still</li><li>Walking down hills can be a bit difficult, walk in a zig-zag pattern</li><li>You can teleport back to the truck at any time, but you'll lose your defensive position</li></ul>\n<p>The hilly and bouldery terrain is a battlefield where many areas can't be hit by your laser. Move forward to the next defensive point when enough cowonas are destroyed in front, so that you wouldn't be overwhelmed shooting back at the few that managed to sneak past.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T15:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ea/6eafa9f14a53e8bcbe20ad81b5c88014.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Capital Asterisk"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
