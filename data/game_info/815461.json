To beat the levels you'll have to strategically die in certain places to create statues that will be necessary to beat the level. You'll have to be fast because the statues will decompose at a certain time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme and limitation:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In this case failure is inevitable because you are required to die to beat the game. You also have to\u00a0<strong>sacrifice\u00a0</strong>your life multiple times to end the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programming: Ojornag</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0o_lobster</p>\n<p>Music: HarumachiMusic</p>\n<p>Sfx: Mixkit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T06:16:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf9/bf9685d4952181cf953d30a53a52bec9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ojornag"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
