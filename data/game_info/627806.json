Talk\u00a0about old friends, regrets, being left behind, and the\u00a0long road ahead. There's a way out, if you want it.</p>\n<p>This is a a fan-game\u00a0made to explore the liminal place where the world of \"Kentucky Route Zero\" meets \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\" Although canon knowledge is encouraged,\u00a0it is entirely possible to play without knowledge of either media. You get the meaning you bring to it.</p>\n<p>The story, characters, and world of Kentucky Route Zero and Twin Peaks belong to their respective creators. I'd never used Unity before making this game, so any errors/bugs are here to stay. It's been a steep learning curve!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Estimated 10 min runtime.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CW:</strong>\u00a0Instance of slowly pulsing/strobing light.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>A+D KEYS to move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CLICK to interact.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MADE FOR:</strong> laughingpineapple, babe_without_the_arms.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/dekker462/sounds/436510/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/sounds/503615/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Samulis/sounds/197781/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Samulis/sounds/197780/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Samulis/sounds/197779/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Samulis/sounds/197778/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/groovyrandomness/sounds/171257/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/thegoose09/sounds/125392/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/kwahmah_02/sounds/255773/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/nnus/sounds/126513/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/kwahmah_02/sounds/253042/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Blu_150058/sounds/326205/</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>https://archive.org/details/78_mexicali-rose_gene-autry-stone-tenney_gbia0196370a/_78_mexicali-rose_gene-autry-stone-tenney_gbia0196370a_01_3.5_ET_EQ.flac</p>\n<p>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Daniel_Birch/indigo/daniel-birch-indigo-girl</p>\n<p>https://archive.org/details/78_if-wed-ever-meet-again_charlie-monroe-and-his-ken...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Dialogue System:</strong></p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/dialogue-system-for-unity-11672\u00a0(fantastic dev support)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T05:10:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cb/8cb81891a176ad2ed907d1a92af1b7b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["kaetts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
