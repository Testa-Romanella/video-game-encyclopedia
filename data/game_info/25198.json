The Galactic Federation&#39;s network computer,<br />\nAurora Unit, is suddenly and completely corrupted with something like a<br />\nvirus. The Federation believes Space Pirates may be behind the problem<br />\nand are soon attacked. Samus and other hunters leap to their defense<br />\nonly to find that the enemy they face is Dark Samus, armed with immense<br />\npower that no one can withstand.</p>\n<p>First-Person Perfect: Players control Samus by moving with the<br />\nNunchuk and aiming with the Wii Remote controller, allowing for a<br />\nlevel of immersion unlike anything they have ever experienced. It&#39;s a<br />\nquantum leap in first-person control.</p>\n<p>Wonderful Weapons: Samus employs well-known power-ups like the<br />\nGrapple Beam and Morph Ball, as well as new surprises, to help her<br />\nsurvive. Using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers, players will be<br />\nable to grasp and pull things by using actual arm movements, as well<br />\nas execute amazing feats like aiming and blasting in midair or at a<br />\nfull run.</p>\n<p>Phazon&#39;s Powers: The game also incorporates a new system<br />\ninvolving Phazon. If you fill Samus&#39; Phazon supply to a certain level,<br />\nSamus will temporarily go into hyper mode, a state in which she can<br />\npull off incredible feats. On the flip side, if she exceeds the<br />\nmaximum Phazon level, she&#39;ll perish. Also, for the first time in the<br />\nMetroid series, Samus&#39; ship will be used in active game play.</p>", "metacritic": 90, "released": "2007-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-13T08:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1ed/1eded24fa739e8edfbae7a0ec931e8f7.jpg", "website": "http://www.metroid.com", "rating": 4.39, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 45, "beaten": 60, "toplay": 49, "dropped": 18, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 54, "suggestions_count": 335, "game_series_count": 13, "reviews_count": 56, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
