There are 16 peculiar specimens to study as you provide for their needs, survive the four seasons and weather conditions, as well as the birds, frogs, hornets, and wolves that will be attacking you mercilessly (they all hunt plants, right?). I'd suggest the Normal Garden first, but if you don't like the idea of swatting away hordes of malicious wildlife, then choose Zen Garden. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b6/5b65325e9c42e8b820fbb8af84ac8cfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["abk7997"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
