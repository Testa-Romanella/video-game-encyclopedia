You must complete all challenges set by your captors. The challenges include complete puzzles by swapping them to create a path between them. This game includes the levels needed to escape the cage as well as a level generator to creating your own levels. You can customise the colour of the three parts of the tiles: connector, center and the back. If you have any feedback, please email me so i can try to change the game to make it better. A demo is available on the game website.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c52/c524ca60bd81e07512b9eab109d83a1e.jpg", "website": "http://www.ryndergames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rynder Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rynder Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
