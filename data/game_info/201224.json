Your rucksack will help!</p>\n<p>For best results try to learn the controls as they're told to you in game. However, if you're stuck and/or think you've missed one of the on-screen instructions, here they are:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Left Ctrl to open rucksack/pick up/drop items</li><li>(Use the mouse to move items around on the inventory screen)</li><li>Left Shift to attack if you have a weapon equipped</li></ul>\n<p>If one of the gates appears to be open but you can't walk through it, sorry, that's a bug. Keep trying for a few seconds and they generally open properly :/</p>\n<p>Pretty map tiles by Buch at OpenGameArt.org,\u00a0http://blog-buch.rhcloud.com\u00a0and Jeffrey Kern (committer and creative consultant).
