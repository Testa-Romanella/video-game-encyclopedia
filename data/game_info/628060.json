The agency you pledge your allegiance to has tasked you with three missions. First, you must capture the corporation\u2019s top-secret intelligence. The intelligence will give you the information on where the agency\u2019s scientist is being held captive, your second mission. Lastly, you must take down the evil corporation once and for all by planting a bomb in their base. How you carry out these missions is up to you. Either complete them stealthily, or use your gun to defeat waves of enemies. Just be prepared to face the consequences of your actions.</p>\n<p>This game was inspired by games such as Hotline Miami and Metal Gear Solid.

I am in my first year of my Bachelor of Creative Technologies at Media Design School. I have enjoyed playing video games since I was a young kid.\u00a0 To be able to work on games is a dream <em>almost\u00a0</em>come true. This game was one of my assignments, and one of the first and most polished games I've made so far. I still have a bit to learn throughout the years. Anyway, please enjoy my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:19:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12f/12fc4cb98c9cee99c307fb751d3742d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["freemanReloaded05"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
