Your task is to find the 5 pieces that need to be placed on the board, and find the 5 scraps of knowledge to help guide you on where to place them. Deduction and exploration are important parts of the game, so be sure to think carefully about all that the ticket master has to say to you, and keep a careful eye out for anything that might be of importance.</p>\r\nKnown bugs.\r\n<p>A Jam game wouldn't be complete without a variety of bugs popping up post-publication. Here are some of ours!</p>\n<ul><li>DO NOT CLICK THE STACK OF CARDS TWICE BEFORE DOING THE PUZZLE.\u00a0<em>Doing so will lock the puzzle and make it impossible to complete the game! (sorry)</em></li><li>Cursor is sometimes stuck in the eye position. Can be fixed by walking up to a wall and back or by looking at the ground. (Raycasting problem)\u00a0</li><li>Multiple playthroughs result in the clock audio doing funky things (But honestly if you're playing the game multiple times I'm flattered.)</li></ul>\r\nThe architects of the station.\r\n<p><em><strong>Station is a game made by Ethan Kessler.</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Landscape art by InnerWindowStudios</em></p>\n<p><em>2D Sprites by Shotgunsexual</em></p>\n<p><em>Sound design and music by Jhaych</em></p>\n<p><strong>Attributions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Assorted environment props: Anaroeto</li><li>Station clock: Anna Vidal</li><li>Base Shader &amp; Style Inspiration: Chrisloop</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:56:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/766/76643b22facf1deadaf448257997b930.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ethan Kessler"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
