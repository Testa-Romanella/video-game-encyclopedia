{"id": 3304, "slug": "skulls-of-the-shogun", "name": "Skulls of the Shogun", "name_original": "Skulls of the Shogun", "description": "<p>Skulls of the Shogun is a turn-based tactical strategy game, set in the fantasy of late medieval Japan. The story of the game focuses on the tale of a dead general, once destined to become the new Shogun but viciously interrupted by a stealthy foe. As he meets his demise, man learns that while not exactly he is capable of returning to life, but instead, he can set out on the way to becoming the new Shogun of the Dead.<br />\nThe game features a set of missions, where the player has to control a small army and defeat their enemy, sometimes far outnumbering. Various tactics can be employed to achieve victory, and the clever use of each unit and their abilities often leads to a swift and fruitful conquest. Each map can be replayed, as different outcomes under different circumstances give new bonuses for the further playthrough.<br />\nThe graphics of the game are hand-drawn, styled like a comic book, where every character looks formidable, but at the same time, hilarious. The strange humor of the game includes several gags about the Japanese culture, history, and mythology, and the dialogues between the characters do not leave any player dissatisfied.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2013-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-28T01:19:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a06ad4fb44d5031dcfa262ffc1759b47.jpg", "website": "http://www.skullsoftheshogun.com", "rating": 2.84, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 70, "owned": 1559, "beaten": 27, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 66, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 127, "ratings_count": 140, "suggestions_count": 666, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 140, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox 360", "Android", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["17-BIT"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "17-BIT"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
