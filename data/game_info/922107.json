{"id": 922107, "slug": "lisa-the-late-night-special", "name": "LISA: The Late Night Special", "name_original": "LISA: The Late Night Special", "description": "<p>A combat mod based on a viral video from years back, LISA: The Late Night Special includes one new fight containing several unique mechanics. Playing with a party of characters from the original LISA: the Painful RPG, you'll fend off some of the most unsavory thrust-humping tactics imaginable.<br/><br/>Created by Auster and MooGoblin, with most of the art assets by Auster and most of the coding done by MooGoblin (although they both dipped into both pools at one point or another).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Additional note - although the party members you're given to play with are mostly untouched, a choice few balance changes/bugfixes have been made for smoother play. These include:</p>\n<ul><li>Brad's Tackle, Head Slide, Homerun Head Slide and both of his Headbutts have been adjusted so while they're still useful as stunning moves, they cannot be as easily spammed.</li><li>Garth can no longer miss allies with his buffs and works as it should.</li><li>Mad Dog's Taunt no longer applies to the enemies and works as it should.</li></ul>\n<p>FINAL NOTE - this is not a playable copy of LISA: the Painful RPG. Save for what was necessary for the mod, it has been gutted of vital internal logic and sounds as to avoid piracy.
