Now stuck in the bunker, you must keep the generators running long enough to get rescued.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t keep them all in working order, things will go wrong. Explore the bunker and learn it's layout for maximum efficiency.</p>\n<p>In the bunker with you resides Miss Eyesore, who will hunt you down if you get to close or venture into the darkness. Keep all doors to dark rooms locked, or else\u2026 she will find you.</p>\n<p>As you play and sectors get locked to keep the monster at bay, your area gets ever smaller and your power meter lower. Good luck!</p>\r\nWARNING: This game contains flashing lights, loud sounds and jumpscares.
