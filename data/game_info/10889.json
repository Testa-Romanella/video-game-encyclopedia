Among a glut of mass privatization, corporations begin contracting private military security firms to protect their assets. Setting a controversial precedent, defense contractor Grand Robotics Inc. deploys a private security firm to be their \"Mergers &amp; Acquisitions\" arm.<br/><br/>After a failed attempt to buy out competing Bartleby Automation, Grand Robotics turns to their security firm to execute a \"hostile takeover\" of their competitor. The firm storms into Bartleby's corporate HQ and locks the building down.<br/><br/>In Turnover you play Clea Holden, a Bartleby worker who becomes caught in the middle of the crisis. Coming to the conclusion that the situation is too volatile, Clea hatches a desperate plan to escape. She must find freedom, armed with only her determination to survive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ff/6ff91035016460c2e7bd11fbe1a5558f.jpg", "website": "http://www.longdivisiondev.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Long Division"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Long Division"], "esrb_rating": null}
