With no immediate means of escape, perhaps all that's left is to attempt to feel some connection with the world at the end of it all.<br/><br/>Far from Noise is a single-player narrative told through dialogue choices. As day fades to night, experience quiet moments of interaction with a variety of creatures and witness the transformative forces of nature as they happen around you.
