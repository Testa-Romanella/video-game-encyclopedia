In this little tale, a girl named Alice has been sucked into the Book of Horrors, and must find a way to escape. As the player, your goal is to guide Alice through this cursed book by taking control of a curious little bat. However, the journey will not be easy, for there are horrid creatures which seek to make Alice a part of the book, forever. Each chapter of the book provides different challenges, and you (the bat) must use your wit to help Alice go home, through any means necessary.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Jason S. \u2013 Project Lead / Creative Director, Character Modeler, 3D Character\u00a0Animator, Game Scripter<br/>Everett B. \u2013 Art Director, UI Designer, Game Artist, VFX Artist, 2D Animator<br/>Branden L. \u2013 Programming Lead, Light Designer, Game Scripter<br/>Jonathan S. - Programmer, Level Designer, 3D Modeler <br/>Nate D. \u2013 Environment Modeler / Texturer, Concept Artist,\u00a02D Animator<br/> Marissa M. \u2013 Structure Artist, Game Art, Game Scripter <br/>Val P. \u2013 Game Artist,\u00a0 2D\u00a0Animator <br/>\u00a0Steven V. \u2013 Level Designer, World Builder <br/>Omar M.- Game Scripter <br/>Jacob W.- Level Designer Game Art <br/>Tom S.- Animator</p>\n\n<p>(This is a Student Project for the Art Institute)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T08:54:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b6ee929e8750a23eb3f58386ce505a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Not Suitable For Humans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
