Managing weapon use is key to getting a high score! Health is represented by the green bar. Weapon damage and percentage is represented by the blue bars. Score is based on how long you survive and the enemies you defeat.</p>\n<strong>A Top-Down Arcade Space Shooter Where You Have to Use Both Weapons!</strong>\n<p>Make use of a long-ranged Laser attack and a short-ranged Pulse attack. Each attack does better in different situations. Each weapon has little use by itself, but when\u00a0<em>joined together</em>, they become a powerful force! Using a weapon will decrease its damage, but will also increase the damage of the other weapon. This means you'll have to constantly switch weapons to hurt enemies and aim for the highest score possible!</p>\n<p>A few new types of enemies will appear as the game progresses. The spawn rate of these enemies will also slowly increase over time.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you leave a comment on the game, feel free to post your highest score.
