They all have their own silly tangents and Easter eggs to explore. You can spend hours getting lost.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExplore haunted desktops and abandoned spaces as you delve deeper into a pixelated fever dream. On your journey you will encounter silly characters and other oddities while you brave what feels like someone\u2019s long forgotten games folder on a computer found during a garage sale.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTetrageddon is a satire about our digital culture in the form of a strange collection of mini games. If you like random humor, warioware, miss the days of Flash game portals and the weird trappings of 90's nostalgia... then Tetrageddon is for you!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are a total of ten mini-games that you can uncover. These range from Anatomically Incorrect Dinosaurs, a dinosaur assembly simulator... to Froggy (It's Hungry!), a post-apocalyptic game about a frog surviving on an international mega-highway at the end of the world.<br/>\r\nTetrageddon is the type of game that's hard to describe and best experienced for yourself.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T04:49:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/212ff47079eda1f452ad0b49695fc7c4.jpg", "website": "http://tetrageddon.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alienmelon"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["alienmelon"], "esrb_rating": null}
