{"id": 502748, "slug": "terminaldungeon", "name": "TerminalDungeon", "name_original": "TerminalDungeon", "description": "<p> <strong>Terminal Dungeon</strong></p>\n<p>TerminalDungeon is a fantasy, turn based, action rpg game, with card game elements. The same game design is going to be applied to open source game with text-based graphic (ASCII) that will work in terminal emulators ie. on Ubuntu server without any GUI. If that projects succeeds (game works and makes any sense), I will develop graphic version using Godot game engine.\r\n</p>\n<p>Characters</p>\n<p>Game will feature a character creator for the player's character, At the moment in basic design all other characters are enemy mobs and bosses for the player to defeat. Those are monsters and undead that dwell in caves.\r\n</p>\n<p>Story</p>\n<p>\r\nPlayer\u2019s Character is recruited by townspeople to investigate castle ruins nearby. Something dwells deep under the castle's dungeons and disturbs the peaceful village of [village name]. Upon arrival the player's character discovers a whole array of creatures that he needs to defeat.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nGameplay\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nGameplay is based around navigating a meta map, with top down perspective. Player can have skills or tools that may help him in avoiding too powerful enemies. However in case of direct contact with the enemy pawn, combat screen will appear.\r\n</p>\n<p>    Combat screen is place where our turn based combat will take place. Player have stats that inform him about his strengths, skills and health. For the cost of action points player can take actions of attacking, defending or using special skills in form of cards he collected earlier in his deck.\r\n</p>\n<p>    After combat is finished and the player survives, the combat window will disappear and the player will be back in the meta map.\r\n</p>\n<p>    Player goal is to reach the end of the level in the form of a staircase leading to the lower level.\r\n</p>\n<p>    Each combat will add experience points that can be spent on upgrading players stats.    </p>\n<p>    Player loses in case his character\u2019s health equals or is less than 0. Player can load the game on the last level he was still alive. Later we can think about permadeath and a more rogue-like approach.\r\n</p>\n<p>    Art Style\r\n</p>\n<p>    This is a 2d top down game. In it\u2019s basic form the whole graphics is going to be just ASCII letters. The graphical version made with Godot Engine is also going to be 2d top down, with nicely illustrated cards for the combat screen. \r\n</p>\n<p>    Music and Sounds\r\n</p>\n<p>    Music should have a fantasy feel, with acoustic background but also synth retro twist. Sound effects are going to be somewhat realistic.     </p>\n<p>\r\nThe Music and Sound section only applies to the graphical Godot version. The ASCII terminal version is going to be silent.\r\n</p>\n<p>    Technical Description\r\n</p>\n<p>    Initially the game will target Linux terminals, as well as windows CMD. X64 and ARM alike.\r\n</p>\n<p>    The Graphic version is going to be focused on PC - Linux, Windows and maybe MacOS. (We will support only platforms that are supported by Godot). Linux ARM platforms like RaspberryPI is \u201cNice to have\u201d.\r\n</p>\n<p>    Marketing and funding\r\n</p>\n<p>    There is none. We are purely bound to organic traffic and anyone willing to help with the project in her/his free time.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:11:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd2/fd29bcc055705688e40d11f8f5b029cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["pawlack"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
