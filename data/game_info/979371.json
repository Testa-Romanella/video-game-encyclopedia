He came from a lowly background, but with his incredible luck, he rose to the top. And even at the peak of his life, he chose to retire and live a peaceful life with his seven wives.\" - This was the response from the little D, who claimed to be sick during college military training and spent the time reading all of Jin Yong's novels.<br/>Years later, the old D finally realized that ordinary people don't have any \"cheats\" in life. His interactions with characters from novels were limited to their backgrounds. The girl he had a crush on in high school ended up with a bad boy. The campus beauty queen in college chose his muscular athlete roommate. His colleague invited him over for dinner at the house of the girl he had a secret crush on. On Christmas, he confessed his feelings to a gorgeous girl only to find out she was his friend's ex-wife. When a lovely designer from Taiwan had to go back to her hometown, all he could afford was to take her to McDonald's (but it was the best McDonald's ever).<br/>If he could turn back time, he would love to tell his younger self that we only live once.<br/>Since there is no time machine in reality, can we build one, the kind that allows us to cheat?<br/><br/>The old D shared this idea with his greasy friends B and G from the film and television industry over a few shots of strong liquor. With tears in his eyes, they all agreed to make it happen. B bluntly stated that after all these years, they should do something serious.<br/><br/>We dug into our own pockets to make this dream a reality and rallied our friends to help. What if we don't have the funds to hire big name celebrities? Well, we turned to our dreams. With our dreams, we were able to secure the friendly appearance of a popular young actress from Taiwan. With our dreams, we were able to convince a team of male producers who were tired of making period dramas to join our project. And with our dreams, we brought on a well-known Chinese music label, Seed Music(Zhongzi Music), to handle all the music production.<br/><br/>Our only goal in doing all of this is to recapture the hormone-fueled excitement of youth - to capture the perfect shots of romantic pursuits, to make the process of falling in love sweet and fulfilling, and to give everyone hope in the beauty of love.<br/><br/>Games can be restarted, but we only live once. Past regrets can be redeemed here, but what truly belongs to you is only the present. Be brave and love, Xiao Bao.<h3>Highlights</h3>Last year, the main creator of an annual drama has always been calm, but on the set, he was full of excitement and high energy.
