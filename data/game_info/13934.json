E River Cabin Journal, Write Your story.....<br/> NB: e-River Cabin Journal is designed to be played a little each day, taking place over REAL hours, days, months and seasons. We have however now added a NEW 'Fast Forward' option for players wanting more flexibility over how they play and incorporate into their spare time. This feature allows players to instantly complete up to 12 tasks each day.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Simulating Homesteading and Survival in your own log cabin deep in the Alaskan wilderness. You choose a location in the Alaskan wilderness to build your cabin... The cabin is built and kitted out with much of the equipment you need to survive The trick is to create a sustainable routine to keep yourself alive from thereon. You choose tasks to undertake, from Gold panning, Fishing and Hunting to tree felling, cooking and foraging. Each task takes a 'real' (and realistic) amount of time to complete, On completion the outcome is relayed in a narrative style in your Cabin 'task journal',Each new day a 'diary journal' is created that describes additional events that may have befallen you since the previous day.<br/><br/>The drawing of 'Fate Cards' in order to achieve set objectives risks further positive or negative incidents to push players beyond pure survival and out of their comfort zone as they become more adept within the game...<br/><br/>The game is as much thinking about, and discussing with others, what you 'plan' to do as it is about the actual 'doing'. It's true strategy and the game unfolds over a full years experience as opposed to a few hours of 'gaming'. You need to blend the game into your real life, because tasks take real periods of time to complete, then it's about patience and planning,reading about what happened after the event, reflecting on that and making your next decision.
