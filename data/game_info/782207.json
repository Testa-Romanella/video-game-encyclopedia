You are an amphibian named Mr. Frogge on a swamp tile grid (from a top-down perspective), and you are trying to avoid the moving obstacles passing through the grid. Since you are a Mister Frogge, you want to collect coins to buy newer and increasingly expensive shoes (\"Jeezys\") to wear. Thus, while hopping around the grid, you are trying to collect as many coins as you can as well as eat some flies to maintain energy.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to last as long as possible and to collect as many coins as you can. There are three levels, and the player levels up after collecting a certain amount of coins. Once the threshold for the number of coins needed to level up is reached, Mr. Frogge gains a new pair of shoes to wear and the size of the grid increases. After collecting enough coins to obtain the third pair of shoes upon completion of level 3, the game still continues and the player\u2019s goal is to obtain a high score. The player\u2019s score is the amount of coins collected.\r\n</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<ul><li>Use WASD or arrow keys to move.</li><li>Mr. Frogge starts with 3 movement charges, and every time he moves one tile, he consumes one charge. In order to regain charges, the player can either stay still for a brief amount of time or eat flies.</li><li>Use the mouse and left click to aim at and eat flies.</li><li>Level upgrades automatically restore charge count.</li><li>At the beginning of a new level, instructions about your new powerup are provided.</li><li>Use ESC or click the top right button to pause the game at any time.</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Artwork made using PiskelApp.com<ul><li>Mr. Frogge sprites and animations by Levent Batakci</li></ul><ul><li>Background, tiles, flies, logs, alligators, and hearts by Sarah Yurick</li></ul></li><li>Music from FesliyanStudios.com<ul><li>\"Like a Boss\" by David Renda: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/download/like-a-boss/317</li><li>\"Training\" by David Renda: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/download/training/344</li><li>\"Slavic Lo-Fi\" by Steve Oxen: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/download/slavic-lo-fi/2035</li><li>\"Chill Gaming\" by David Fesliyan: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/download/chill-gaming/350</li></ul></li><li>Sound effects by Cameron Byrne</li><li>Menus by Raunak Bhimsaria</li><li>Start menu image: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Frog_dressed_as_gentleman_with_flowers,_top_hat_and_umbrella_Wellcome_V0050703.jpg</li><li>Warning exclamation points:\u00a0https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/double-exclamation-mark_203c-fe0f.png</li><li>Pause menu image:\u00a0https://fs.noorgram.ir/pic/2020/34/%D8%B9%DA%A9%D8%B3%20%D9%BE%D8%B3%20%D8%B2%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%86%D9%87%20%DA%86%D9%88%D8%A8%DB%8C.jpg</li><li>End menu image:\u00a0https://preview.redd.it/iuaxttitgbg71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6c54f6e272a5f0d4761e9482b1acf2ee02f191a</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T23:54:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14f/14fb9792e8787f195e4b3468c14fdbdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Case Western Reserve Univ.
