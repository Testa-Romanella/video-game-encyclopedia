Talking to the same character twice may yield different greetings!<br/><br/>There is no ending as of yet but talking to the final character might prove challenging! I also plan to make it playable in the browser.<br/><br/>If you'd like to report any bugs or want to request features or for your OC to be in the game please join my Discord server: discord.gg/E8s3T33wj3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T05:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54b/54b7f4d2d31a44328ec72eb19dea2941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProvidedDuck"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
