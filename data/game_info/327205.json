With Unexplored we experimented with new ways of generating procedural dungeons. We wanted levels to feel as though they were designed by hand, rather than by an algorithm.</p>\n<p>The experiment succeeded beyond our expectations and we\u2019re extremely proud that our humble indie game has received widespread recognition from critics. Most notably, PC Gamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, and Vice Waypoint all featured Unexplored as part of their respective Game of the Year articles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-09T17:38:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a06f44dcd4b563bedda040c17dc1a65c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.17, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 112, "toplay": 23, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 510, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Ludomotion"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Sugar"], "esrb_rating": null}
