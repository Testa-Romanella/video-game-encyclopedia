I intend to create a dark and immersive story with characters you feel genuine connections with. There will be harsh choices and brutal and agonizing moments. Please leave any advice or criticism all will be appreciated. I also wish to make the combat manic and hopefully a lot more interactive so any suggested plug ins would be digital gold for me. Thank you so very much for taking the time.</p>\n<p>- The Smirking Kaggs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T03:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a41/a41a947d37ec69ea732e9759bcfcf51d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Smirking Kaggs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
