{"id": 944691, "slug": "die-versus-die", "name": "DIE versus DIE", "name_original": "DIE versus DIE", "description": "<p><em>DIE versus DIE</em> is a new tabletop RPG from Meldar16. Best   suited for fantasy settings, it includes mechanics on how to resolve   challenges by muscle, brains, or magick. While you can play with the   standard 7 piece ttrpg dice set, it's preferable that you little dice   goblins get a whole stinkin' lot of dice.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Like many other TTRPGs, players will use their dice and rules to   collectively tell a story with a game master running the show. <em>DIE     versus DIE</em> will always use dice rolls to resolve challenges and   conflicts. The game master sets a difficulty to overcome an obstacle,   and the player will succeed or fail based on a die roll corresponding   with the player characters' stats and skills. Your standard dice set   (the usual d20, d12, d10, d8, d6 &amp; d4) also acts as a meter for   the current potency of those same attributes.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T12:25:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbd/dbd4a04998f818b9e8df618377ad728b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["meldar16"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
