Work needs to be done to expand her options of food, drink, and play. Her voice also needs some more work.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>To play:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Click her to have her speak. Click the car going by to scare her. When she gets too hungry, bored, or thirsty, she will let you know. Just click the corresponding option to help her solve her issue.\u00a0<br/><br/>I am not sure when or if I will expand on this. I may just do a complete overhaul with new art. This will be after July 2022 at the earliest.\u00a0<br/><br/>In the meantime, feel free to leave feedback and suggestions. I'll certainly keep them in mind when deciding to go forward.\u00a0<br/><br/><em>As of now, raccoon, food, teapot, and papers were made by Rayane Felix (Tiny tales)<br/>Music is In the Zone by\u00a0</em><em>https://failpositive.bandcamp.com/</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T12:58:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a98/a985edca75cbbfbf37a5e7e004f5a5b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tsukichild"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
