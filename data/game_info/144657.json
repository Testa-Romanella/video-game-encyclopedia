This game has the player being or taking control of a nearly invincible being who can create, destroy or merely observe the universe or world or even time itself. I wanted the player to feel a sense of what a person, not omniscient or perfect, but just a being with near unlimited power would do. This includes what would probably realistically happen but still, with branching options. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SoulMura"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
