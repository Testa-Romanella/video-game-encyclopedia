Type in the numbers above zombies' heads to kill them, but only the odd-numbered ones! Be nice to the even-numbered zombies, they're your friends and won't hurt you!<br/></p>\n<p>The game endlessly gets harder, as more and more zombies spawn at once, and the numbers they have above their heads will get longer and longer as well. Thought typing out \"twentyfive\" was hard? Just wait until you need to type out \"hundredfortynine\" before you get your face eaten!</p>\n<p>Anyway, it's just a tiny jam game made in a few hours, so don't expect massive quality or depth to it. But if you want a little arcade game to kill a few minutes, it exists. Woo!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75dfbf12b8123753bcb9ce93c40d2887.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
