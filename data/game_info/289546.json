That there were not enough pieces? Or that you should be rewarded for stacking cleanly even if you don't make full lines? Try out Spyro Oshisaure's Puzzle Juggle Trouble then!<br/><br/>In this game, just like in regular Tetris, pieces fall from the sky. Unlike regular Tetris however, you are given two pieces at once, and you can swap between controlling one or the other at any given time. You clear blocks by either making solid lines, or by filling square regions of at least 5 blocks by 5 blocks. The former increases the speed of the blocks' fall, the latter makes you move on to more and more complex pieces. Clear as many squares and lines as possible to make your score as high as you can!<br/></p>\n<p>This game is most likely going to get updated in the future to add a few more things, like a puzzle mode, a coop mode,  or a sandbox mode.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T04:35:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a1446063a3926ccab086b93537b9c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Oshisaure"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
