The graphics are simple and limited to match the style of the LCD displays. Character movement is limited to fixed positions in the play-field and the frame-rate feels a little slow and unnatural to match the same game-feel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26c678ed42c007169341f854a4e55528.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aseaboyer"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
