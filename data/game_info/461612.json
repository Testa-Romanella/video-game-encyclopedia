{"id": 461612, "slug": "sleepy-stone", "name": "Sleepy Stone", "name_original": "Sleepy Stone", "description": "<p>- This game requires a controller to play and was made with an xbox controller but a dual shock should work as well. -</p>\n<p>Originally the plan was to make a 3d platformer that removed a lot of the movement control player\u2019s expect from the genre. Taking a heavy character like a stone and giving it movement in it\u2019s dream. On a whim I added the mechanics of rolling and using momentum to spring the character forward or up with great force and found it to be a lot of fun. This ended up changing all my plans for the original 3 - 4 levels and switching to developing levels on the fly.</p>\n<p>Although buggy I think this was a successful attempt to create something a little different from the traditional 3d platformer and it shows some promise. It does need a lot of refinement though and I would like to see a better return to my first intent of using the project to practice with visual storytelling.</p>\n<p>I need to add in some features like better tutorializing, keyboard and mouse control, and a tighter gameplay but I expect that I will return to this project sooner rather than later.</p><p>- freesound.org attribution list -</p><p>Rockfall in mine.wav - Benboncan</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Benboncan/sounds/60085/</p>\n<p>Party noise maker _ soundstack.wav new yeears eve, party, horn, party favor - Soundstack</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/soundstack/sounds/203246/</p>\n<p>3 Men Cheering - jbeetle</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/jbeetle/sounds/274510/</p>\n<p>8-Bit Jump - evan.schad</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/evan.schad/sounds/518126/</p>\n<p>Pop 3 - greenvwbeetle</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/greenvwbeetle/sounds/244653/</p>\n<p>Bounce - josepharaoh99</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/383240/</p><p>Thank you so much to everyone on this list for providing assets to creators like myself!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T06:03:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fdf4a83af5dfcacf02da381beaa7272.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron_C"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
