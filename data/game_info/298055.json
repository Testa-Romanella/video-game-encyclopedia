Created for the\u00a0<strong>Blackthornprod GAME JAM #2.\u00a0</strong>I made 100% of the assets in this time (the models, the music, the particles and VFX systems, the sounds, and of course the coding - though, I did have to look up code and equations for some of the mathematics and calculations) :)</p>\n<ul><li>You use the mouse to play the game, left clicking the creatures on the green planet to eat them (which will satisfy your hunger, but cause you to grow segments which makes your hunger go down faster).</li><li>Left click twice on another planet to move to it</li><li>Right click and drag to look around the planet or worm to find other planets</li></ul>\n<p>Fire planets will harm you, but take off segments which slows your hunger growth rate.</p>\n<p>Water planets will stop you burning, so are best visited after fire planets.</p>\n<p>Any planet your worm is in will slowly shrink, and when it has reached it's minimum size,\u00a0 your hunger will grow even faster! So don't stay on one planet too long!</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy! See how long you can survive!\u00a0And stay away from the black hole!</p>\n<p>#BTPGameJam<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:24:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1db18d924100773ab29c1e45da10e9a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
