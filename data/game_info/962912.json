A group that was formed during the early days of the virus, a group that fought against the governments military when they were eliminating everyone who showed possible signs of being sick, even without proof. 50 years later, they have formed on an island 100 miles away from inland. Now you are stuck surviving and helping the Activist hold steady with their colony. It's up to you, on what you decide to do on the island.  Whether you create your own colony, or join forces with other survivors. The island is full of infected and dangerous weather conditions, so be careful with the path you choose, as it might be the last decision you ever make.<h3>Intense Survival</h3>Your survival is based on what you choose to do while on the island, work alongside fellow survivors or follow the lonely path and remain silent in the world. The infected have taken control of the island, and their mutation abilities range from mild to insane! Always be prepared for the unexpected.<h3>Build your colony and craft your tools</h3>You have the freedom to establish an entire colony, that welcomes all, or perhaps a threatening colony with evil intent. There are many items and options when it comes to building, giving you creative freedom to make it feel like \"home\". Crafting is crucial to your survival, from weapons to useful tools, the list goes on and on.<h3>Harsh Weather Conditions</h3>Not only will you have to worry about the groups of infected, but you will also be facing harsh weather that could end your life just as quick as a bite to the face. Dress accordingly or you'll end up part of the environment with your rotting corpse.<h3>Exploration can unlock many secrets</h3>The island is full of hidden secrets and untapped history. Whether you travel on foot or find a vehicle, the mountains spread a massive 64km giving you a lot of freedom to explore and discover.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T05:00:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/152/15270a8276a971a294051adc152bbc41.jpg", "website": "https://playshattered.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 460, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moonman Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Moonman Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
