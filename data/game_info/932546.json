Many of the beings in this dark place try to keep him there.</p>\n<p>The player has the\u00a0option to decide how he wants to spend the limited time he has for each level. He can trade time for speed, dashes and other abilities.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Move: WASD</p>\n<p>Jump: Space</p>\n<p>Attack: Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Dash: Shift</p>\n\n<p>There are still a lot of things we wanted to include in this project, so we will add extra content in the future! A little trick for the speedrunner: you can jumpcancel with the attack if done correctly, to get another jump (or even two with the double jump ability!)</p>\n\n<p>This project was created in three days by:</p>\n<p>Jan Berke:<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/jackfoxer<br/></p>\n<p>Simon Waldsch\u00fctz:</p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/simon_waldschuetz<br/></p>\n<p>Alexandros Papatrechas:</p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/alexandros_pt<br/></p>\n<p>Florian Diehl:</p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/floriandiehl<br/></p>\n<p>Noah Gutschmidt:</p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/noah_gutschmidt<br/></p>\n\n<p>Music by https:(//www.youtube.com/@Pixverses) and (https://twitter.com/pixverses)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T18:09:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/747/74743bc0dbcfcc4902d2bde9d78a5d30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Gnomes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
