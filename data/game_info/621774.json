Even with many tests on the rocket, there was an unforeseen fatal error that occurred in the rocket\u2019s processing during its flight to mars. Fortunately, the AIA was able to take control of the rocket and bring it back to earth\u2019s atmosphere safely, but it can not land! Your job is to go into the rocket with a drone, assess the damage, and fix it so the rocket ship can be sent on its return to Mars!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T00:09:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60e/60e18486c2e3604e988e33aa01a7233c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["WolfieC09"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
