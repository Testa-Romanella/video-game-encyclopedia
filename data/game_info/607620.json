Try to colonize as many planets as you can along the way before you reach the worm hole at the end or crash your ship. Your people are depending on you to find more planets to colonize. When you colonize a planet they will change color and your species will prosper within those lands. Get out there and colonize as many planets in the galaxy as you can with your rocket. Your people need you!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>[A &amp; D] / [Left Arrow &amp; Right Arrow] - Move Rocket</p>\r\nJudging\r\n<p>Submission for:\u00a0LM0B Beginners Game Jam #28<br/>\r\nTheme: Arcade<br/>Time Frame: 5 Days</p>\n<ol><li>Fun - Is the game fun?\r\n<br/>\r\nYes the game is pretty fun/addicting.\r\n</li><li>Free Bugs - Were there a lot of bugs/ glitches .
