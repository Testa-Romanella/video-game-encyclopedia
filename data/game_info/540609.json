The protagonist has to move around all while avoiding or killing the enemies. This game focuses on using local real world effects such as the sound effect of the real MRT and the flooring in the MRT so as to make the player feel as if they are in the real MRT. The music also tries to be scary enough to increase immersion in the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move the character</li><li>Left click to attack</li><li>Your anxiety level will increase, eat pills by destroying MRT chairs</li></ul>\n\n<p>\\/ Download \\/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T05:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/654/654b863ba12cb3397bbff39cb43b72f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amran"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
