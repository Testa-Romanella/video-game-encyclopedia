You are some sort of sapient species, recently evacuated to an asteroid base where rebels aligned with the mysterious Good Dalek plot to overthrow the might of the evil Dalek Empire. Your aim is to strike back against the Daleks using whatever skills, spaceships, and sandwiches life puts at your disposal!<br/></p>\n<p>On your way, you'll be able to explore an open-world, lovingly crafted setting with multiple planets to visit, asteroids to dodge, card games to play, robots to pilot, mazes to explore, a snarky text parser, and everything else you'd expect from an adventure game. You'll meet a range of DW aliens as well - draconians, sontarans, foamasi, adipose, silurians, even these weird ape-descendants called \"humans\" got in there somehow...<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy the game!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Whilst I'll try and look at the comments on itch.io occasionally, it's not a reliable way to reach me.\u00a0Please instead\u00a0submit bug reports and feature requests on the game's Exilian forum, here:<br/>https://exilian.co.uk/forum/index.php?board=240.0<br/><br/>(Usual disclaimer: Doctor Who and all related concepts are owned by the BBC.
