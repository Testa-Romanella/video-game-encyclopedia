You surely don't want an ocean of vegetables to invade your house !</p>\n<p>Try to hold on as long as you can, and don't go bankrupt\u00a0!</p>\n<p><strong>This game is meant to be played with a mouse</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Xeo an Qualia here</strong> ! We hope that you'll enjoy this little project. It was our second gamejam together, and we had a really great time\u00a0! Making a game as modest as it is in such a limited time fuels inspiration and motivation, hopefully this game\u00a0conveys these latter !
