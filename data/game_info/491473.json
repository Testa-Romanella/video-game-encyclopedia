You only have a rifle, ammunition, and a small camp. In this seemingly uninhabited place, there are many empty and creepy houses. Every night you can hear the howl of a werewolf, the opportunity to meet him appears only at night. Be careful, if you succeed, you fall into an illusion.<br/><br/>In this dream, you will visit different places and points of the world. For example: an Arctic island, a vast desert, the streets of a beautiful and interesting city on the coast of the sea and stay above the abyss of the ocean.<br/><br/><br/>The battle with your opponent will not be so easy, because you will not see him. Here you will need to listen to every step and roar, but you will also help your rifle, which reacts to the enemy in different colors. The yellow light indicates that he is somewhere nearby, and the red light indicates that you need to shoot immediately. But all this must be done quickly and clearly, otherwise you will not be well.<br/><br/><br/>Only you, The Last Saviour, can save this world, which is on the verge of destruction. So do it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T03:13:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44d/44d50a0bce83f2057f86ed712cb56520.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 477, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NGOG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NGOG"], "esrb_rating": null}
