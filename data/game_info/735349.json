Fights are all about optimizing your move usage to hit as many spawns as possible.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>A ton of playable characters and abilities!</strong> 20+ characters, each with their own set of abilities from a pool of 60+ unique moves of different types, elements, and usage. No two characters play the same!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Partake in intense 1-vs-1 and whole party\u00a0fights!\u00a0</strong>Each side can have up to 3 party members. Hectically switching between your party to burn through all cooldowns\u00a0is key!</p>\n\n<p><strong>(Almost) completely hand-drawn graphics!\u00a0</strong>Nearly every sprite and background\u00a0in this game were drawn on paper before being digitally covered, all done to make the art pop out.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Combine different attacks for devastating effects!</strong> Set embers ablaze to start a fire! Place down a lightning rod before using a shock attack to do massive damage! Plant seeds and attack your foes with wild vines!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Play through 20+ fun levels!</strong> Some levels have unique twists and conditions. Be ready!</p>\n\n<p>Want to add YOUR original character to the game?
