Where only two opposing forces: forward and goalkeeper (well, even between them there may be a wall). The objective of the forward to score a goal, the objective of the goalkeeper is not to pass the ball into his own goal. In this mini game you can choose on whose side to be. The control of the goalkeeper is made with the arrow keys, the control of the forward is even easier - with the mouse button to direct the ball and hold to set the impact force on the ball. On the screen there is a settings panel for selecting side, the presence of the wall, the difficulty of the goalkeeper or striker.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e04/e0478341f935c83c3ab735edd661e7c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 33}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 3346, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CASGames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["CASGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
