The team worked on building multiple mechanics on top of the FPS Unreal template with the idea that multiple\u00a0gun mod mechanics can be\u00a0used together on the same gun. The player can mix and match mods to create a weapon of their liking.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>The mods themselves are divides into 2 categories : physical and elemental. A gun is allowed to have as many physical mods as the player wants and a single elemental mod.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Tech doc</strong> :\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LweVNgQoGS7PEmxzGBiLOASDPnNR0YXn/edit?usp=sh...</p>\n<p><strong>Team Members :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Amos Dong, Hyrum Gunther,\u00a0KD Singh,\u00a0Shankar Siddharth Kanniappan Anbalagan,\u00a0Yexiang Zhou</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T07:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23a556659299f1f9d07eb8f2b5dda2a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["poopfireshots"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
