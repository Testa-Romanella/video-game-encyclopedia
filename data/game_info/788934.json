And it's completely free!</p>\n\n<p>Seriously though, this <em>apparently effortless</em> Jam encouraged me enough to make me work on a game project from start to finish, and publish it, and I'm really grateful for that! This project, even if super basic, proved to be such a good test for all the programming skills learned in the past months, but never really put into a real-world-like situation.</p>\n<p>So yeah, low effort, but still big effort! Make sure to let me know what you think of the game (lmao), but also stay tuned for (hopefully) better and bigger projects!
