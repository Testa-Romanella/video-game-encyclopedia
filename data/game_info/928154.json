I started a new project sort of challenge: one game a week.

You can shoot them with the paint gun or place a tower that will shoot aliens. Aliens can drop scrap or medkit. You can use scrap to build defense towers or fix the tower and shelter. And you can use a medkit to heal yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The code of the game is open source with an MIT license, feel free to drop a PR.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/mika314/KitchenSink<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T20:43:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/477/477e1eb13fdb5b16d189f96583450c28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Mika Pi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
