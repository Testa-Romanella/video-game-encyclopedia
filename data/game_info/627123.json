I attempted to make everyone but the player (the cat) a ghost, but it's not particularly apparent. I might add some abandoned back rooms to achieve the forgotten places theme.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As far as gameplay goes, you find all the things in the theater. (which is 3 things right now, not including the music you \"steal\" from the band) I'm hoping to expand this, with more rooms, and more places to explore.</p>\n\n<p>I forgot to add a control scheme in game so I'll add it here:\r\n</p>\n<p>WASD to move\r\n</p>\n<p>E to see your progress screen\r\n</p>\n<p>Escape to see the pause menu\r\n</p>\n<p>You use your mouse for the rest of the UI.\r\n</p>\n<p>Enjoy!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There are four different things you can go find in the level, which makes for a 2-5 minute playtime.\u00a0 (One of the things doesn't have an icon that shows you that you can click on it, you can.)</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy the whole 5 minutes of playtime!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/772/7723f223ed8a635145d71f605a700231.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hologram 0"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
