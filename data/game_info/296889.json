You start out in a creepy place where the floor is black and white and a few white walls. It is very difficult to win. Please keep in mind that the game is still in beta and certain walls may not be functioning. Also I have made types of monsters that get in the way and are quite hard to past and very scary too. Hope you enjoy my game.</p>\n<p>Please keep to note that this is a horror game and certain people may or will get scared which can lead into PTSD, Nightmares or other problems. Certain patterns or light can trigger people diagnosed to photo sensitive Epilepsy such as flashing lights or white\u00a0contrasting patterns, play this game at your own risk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beta 1.5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:47:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8ed8a16814198e7d79800da980395d5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PinataDog Entertainment"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
