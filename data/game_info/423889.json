It is meant to be educational, and there will be a Youtube Series explaining how to create this at\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQP4qSCj1eHMHisDDR4iPzw.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\nQuestion Blocks\r\n<p>To place a custom question block, go to the Prefabs tab and select a question block, then place it in the scene.</p>\n<p>Then to change what's inside it, click the question block located in the scene, and select the item from the popup menu.</p>\n<p>If you select a Mushroom item, Mario will get a mushroom if he is small, and a Flower if he is big, and a Coin if he is already Fire Mario.</p>\r\nPipes\r\n<p>To place connected pipes: Go to the prefabs section, and pick a pipe. Then place the pipe in the scene.</p>\n<p>Next, click the bottom left corner of the pipe that you just placed, select the exit pipe you would like. Next, click the bottom left corner of the exit pipe and position it where you would like.</p>\n<p>Red pipes indicate entrances.</p>\n<p>Orange pipes indicate Exits.</p>\r\nMario Player\r\n<p>To place a player into the scene, just click prefabs and place one Mario in the scene where you would like him to start. If you place more then one, the game will glitch :)</p>\r\nEnemies\r\n<p>Go to prefabs, and place enemies wherever you would like them to go.
