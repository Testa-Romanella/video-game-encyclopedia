You must use your skills of strategy and survival to live long enough to escape.<br/><br/>In this game there is not a set path for your story and you must explore and scavenge what you can without being torn apart. There are many rooms to explore in the building and not only do you have to find them but there are keys spread out across the levels for you to find and use. There are seven levels accessed by elevator each with new challenges and plenty of monsters to hunt you down. While running and hiding in the many halls and rooms of the compound you can also collect batteries to supply your flashlight needed for seeing in the dark maze in which you travel.<br/><br/>This is my first video game created and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T05:41:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbbceb66227787fc09f7e5db026ad3c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LXXII"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LXXII"], "esrb_rating": null}
