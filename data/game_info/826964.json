This game is inspired by the programming-puzzle games of Zachtronics, and was built to run inside of their latest game, \"Last Call BBS.\"</p>\n<p>Subleq stands for \"SUbtract and Branch if Less than or EQual to 0.\" This mouthful of a description doesn't tell you much, but this one operation combined in the right ways is Turing complete.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The logic behind how a set of subleq-powered operations is derived is surprisingly simple, and my goal with this game was to give you, as the player,\u00a0the opportunity to build up a set of subleq instructions for yourself. I hope you enjoy :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T07:30:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b0/3b0e071adaaa22f2f6794f340610d4fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["galactical"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
