Throughout your journey, train an evomon so that it can become an Evomon Champion.<br/><br/><h3>What is it like to care for a little Evomon?</h3><br/>Be a good trainer for your little Evomon, feed him various foods, clean his poop when necessary, spend your Evocoins buying new tools at the store and make sure he has everything he needs to continue his heavy and intense routine. Otherwise it may need to be frozen ahead of time.<h3>You don't want to just take care of a baby forever, do you?</h3><br/>Train your little Evomon like never before in intense minigames in the Training Grounds, earn XP to evolve it and find out what its older version will look like.<br/><br/><br/>Discover special Evomons in the Expedition Area, where you can play different expeditions and at the end of each one, earn an exclusive item that can be used in the Lab to combine a special Evomon.<br/><br/><br/>Are you out of money? No problem, go to the Fishing Area and fish for special and unique fishing items or assorted fish, which can be used as food for your evomon, or to sell and barter some good Evocoins.<h3>What would your dream bedroom look like?</h3><br/>Earn new furniture from the gacha machine and customize your room the way you want with lots of different furniture.<h3>Do you still have energy for a battle?</h3><br/>Take your strong and fearless adult Evomon into the Final Battles, where you will defeat Evomons from a variety of trainers. Even if you can't defeat them all at once, take all your knowledge gained in battle and combine a new Evomon in the Lab. Start a new adventure with your new Evomon, until you defeat all the monsters and become an Evomon Champion.<br/><br/><br/>Combine new Evomons in the Lab at the end of each Evocycle.
