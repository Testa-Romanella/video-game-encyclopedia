On the same morning as the attack on Pearl Harbor, forces of the Empire of Japan attacked the British Crown colony of Hong Kong, without declaring war against the British Empire. The Hong Kong garrison consisted of British, Indian and Canadian units, also the Auxiliary Defence Units and the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps (HKVDC).<br/><br/>Within a week the defenders abandoned the mainland and less than two weeks later, with their position on the island untenable, the colony surrendered.<br/><br/><br/>This game covers the rather unknown fight in the British colony of Hong Kong at the start of the Pacific War during World War Two, between the British and Commonwealth forces and their Japanese opponents. The outnumbered defenders managed to resist for 3 weeks, abandoned by all. They did it for the glory, and this fight is worth being recalled. <br/><br/>Can you do better than history and, as the British commander, resist past the 3 weeks, inflicting an intolerable loss of face to your opponent? Or, as the Imperial Japanese commander, can you win that battle quickly and dispatch your forces in significant numbers back to the other fronts of the war?<br/><br/>Glory Recalled lasts 18 turns, each representing 1 day of real time, between the 8th and the 26th December 1941. There is only one scenario, with some opening options to give a few variable starts or setups (such as more troops, more planes or different units start). <br/><br/>As a part of the SGS family, the gamplay is very similar to that of the other games, where you move air and land units, play cards to sustain your actions, and interact with the other player or AI in a turn-based game mode.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Japanese have strong troops, armor, artillery and a powerful air force, but they must seize the enemy holdings in a short time, and crossing the harbor to Victoria Island may be risky. <br/></li><li>The British are on a defensive stance in their colony, but their numbers and resources are scarce and they have almost no defense against Japanese air supremacy.</li></ul><br/>The game's event cards allow full replayability thanks to the numerous various situations that they create in the diplomatic, military, political or morale fields.<br/><br/><strong>Estimated Playtime</strong>: 4h00+.<br/><strong>Favored Side</strong>: none.<br/><strong>Hardest to Play</strong>: British.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T04:10:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/0127b79c8c8e4df2668765fe5ab329ec.jpg", "website": "https://strategygamestudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 361, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["The Strategy Game Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Avalon Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
