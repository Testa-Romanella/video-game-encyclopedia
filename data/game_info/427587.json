But then there was that horrible accident during the production of Cymbeline, and now you're sort of a ghost. Emphasis on sort of. Everyone still thinks that you're alive, to the point of <strong>maybe dating you</strong>, and you've even signed up for the latest play, King Lear, written by Girl Werewolf Hamlet.<br/><br/>Look, it's a whole thing, okay?<br/><br/>Haunted by your past, you must make this the best play ever! Influence the main faculty, make friends and defeat enemies, and just have the best summer theater experience that a ghost actor has ever had!<br/><br/>Each segment of the game feeds into the next: your schooling during the day will affect the play during the night. As an incorporeal (somewhat) being, you have the ability to change how the play goes, and therefore how it is received by the general public. Your friendships and rivalries will spill out on to the stage, you'll chart each actors progress and teach them new skills, and you might even alter King Lear forever! A drama might become a comedy, a comedy might become a drama!<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> Use your ghost powers to manipulate every aspect of the production of King Lear. </li></ul><ul><li> Interact with a host of students.</li></ul><ul><li> Date five people. Not all at once.</li></ul><ul><li> Solve the mystery of your own murder!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T06:21:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b3/8b3ae1cfa03df7ec1916a2bf9f938c4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Development"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
