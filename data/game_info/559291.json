The intentions of the project are to involve players to be entangled within this creeping world. Created in the form of a poetic narrative, this game is built into a fragmented, haunting narrative. With the usage of typical horror elements along with notions of agency-dictated personal aesthetics, The Haunted House is being created with the hope to be easily accessible to the average gaming consumer in the usage of elements of typical type and click-based interaction but also created in the jagged form of an unreliable narrative.\u00a0</strong></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/00270c81b8b19a3c0d1c144ef7931807.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jabderhalden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
