I really enjoy paddling along in an open boat through some trees on a sunny day so I wanted to recreate that little micro experience in a game while also adhering to the game jam brief of \"Home\"</p>\n<p>When playing, imagine your paddle in your hands.</p><p>\u00a0When you Lean (move the mouse left or right) you are picking how far out from the boat your paddle enters the water.</p><p>Just as in real life, if you put the paddle into the water (by clicking)\u00a0close to the boat, you go in a straight line. If you put the paddle in far away from the boat, you turn.\u00a0</p><p>The longer you hold the mouse button for, the longer your stroke is and the bigger impact on your speed and heading it has.</p><p>While your paddle is in the water (while you hold the mouse button), you can still\u00a0Lean (move the mouse) to change the position of your paddle and\u00a0control the direction the boat travels in.</p><p>Try making long strokes, starting close to the canoe and only leaning towards the end of the stroke to change direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Code by me, Thomas Phillips\r\n</p>\n<p>Skybox from:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-s...\r\n</p>\n<p>Equipment in the bottom of the canoe from:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/tools/bush-craft-extensio...\r\n</p>\n<p>Canoe and water plane from:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/sea/indian-kanoe-malec...\r\n</p>\n<p>Scene and almost all of it's contents from:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/rocky-h...\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional ground textures from:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/adam-...\r\n</p>\n<p>Music from:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqOifyDOI1E\r\n</p>\n<p>Birdsong from:\u00a0https://www.british-birdsongs.uk/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:01:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c0c3e6a33adfbd75785ce6ae36acfe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["igd"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
