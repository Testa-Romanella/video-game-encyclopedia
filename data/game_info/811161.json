I had a lot of fun making it and I will be posting more games in the future. I made the art fairly quickly as to focus on the programming, but I think it turned out well enough. The goal of the game is to lose as much weight as possible by\u00a0collect healthy food and avoiding unhealthy food while running on a treadmill. You lose weight over time, but the healthy food helps you do that quicker. You start with five lives and lose one each time you eat an unhealthy food. Once you lose, you will be forced to watch as your character regains all the weight you worked so hard to lose while the treadmill burns in the background. So don't lose :)</p>\n<p>\u00a0I hope you enjoy the game!</p>\n<p>Game Font:\u00a0A Absolute Empire Font | wepfont | FontSpace</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:31:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/899/8999e28b28fcf4c260fe9dd67af4edb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LegacyLightningGames"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
