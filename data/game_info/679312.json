Since that game didn't exist, I decided to make it.</p>\n<p>In this game you choose from three locations:</p>\n<p>1. A small planet with dragon hunter ships surrounded by hundreds of giant mountains.</p>\n<p>2. An enormous cave filled with giant crystals and cave monsters.</p>\n<p>3. A cave race track to truly test your flying skills.</p>\n<p>Your goal in the cave and around the planet is to earn as many points as possible before time runs out by destroying enemies and hitting bonus targets. You also earn points by flying close to the ground and objects. Earn even more points by flying faster and spinning!</p>\n<p>Your highscore is saved to a central server where you can see the top scores of the community. See how many points you can earn!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T07:09:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab38928d8a58949fa8a83c7c5ebe8dca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BenderiteGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
