The remake aims to update the game for a new audience with features not possible on original hardware, such as color, no screen crunch, and a higher resolution. In addition, extra additions such as new levels, characters, and a level maker are also planned.\u00a0What you see here is an early test map of the game's physics, which will be updated frequently as more features and refinements are added, and will eventually be replaced with a demo of the first level, then we'll go from there. A tutorial screen will be added soon, but until then the controls are as follows:<br/></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD, Analog Stick, or DPAD</p>\n<p>Jump: P, A on Controller</p>\n<p>Run: O, X on Controller</p>\n<p>Restart Demo: R</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T05:15:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/8612b991ccbafa77d85f3e765d545734.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperCitrus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
