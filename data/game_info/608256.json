You play as the shopkeeper outside of a local dungeon. Equip heroes efficiently so they can make it out of the dungeon with more loot (for you to buy), or swindle your way to riches by taking advantage of your customer's interests! A good business-person employs a good mix of both.</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to open the Shop Menu<br/></p>\r\n\u00a0= Attack/Damage:\u00a0 \u00a0Base damage dealt\r\n\u00a0= Defense:\u00a0 \u00a0Reduces damage received\r\n<p> = Dexterity:\u00a0 \u00a0Scales Hero damage by (Hero Dex / Room Dex)</p>\n<p>Heroes can only equip 5 items at a time, any extras will not add to their stats.</p>\n<p>Equipped items are highlighted in green in the hero's inventory.</p>\n<p>The progress bar at the top represents the dungeon. When you're done with a customer press \"End Transaction\", and the Hero will go into the dungeon.\u00a0 If a Hero is already in the dungeon, new ones will queue up and wait for the first one to be done.\u00a0When a Hero dies in the dungeon, they will respawn back in line. When all the rooms in the dungeon have been defeated, the day will roll over with a new\u00a0(harder) dungeon.</p>\n<p>Hover over the icons in the dungeon to compare stats between the dungeon room and the hero that is in that room (if there is one).</p>\n<p>Each hero only has three lives. When they run out, they die, losing all of the items they had on them. But don't worry, there are new customers abound where there's adventure to be found!<br/></p>\n<p>The other half of the dev team - https://84d93r.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T07:47:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/402/40230eac4aaabb0edb51018deeae162a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WardensDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
