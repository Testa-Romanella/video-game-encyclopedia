There's no mechanic to obtain extra lives, but it is possible to catch the ball when it drops to add some color.</p><p>If playing on mobile, make sure to be in landscape mode before running it. The game only functions in landscape and I haven't worked out automatically changing to it yet. If on an iPhone, I'd recommend trying this in Chrome rather than Safari.</p><p>(I'm aware this is all a little clunky, but will be addressing that as I am able.)<br/></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:41:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfb/dfb7997d0d2759292aa6aa733fd64aff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mordacius"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
