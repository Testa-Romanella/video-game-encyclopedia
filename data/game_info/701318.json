However,\u00a0Marisa will miss no opportunity to gather as many valuable treasures as she can carry on the way.</p>\n<p>Collect all 3 items before the music ends (about 4 min.) and bring them to the cauldron next to Marisa's house. Collect additional items for more points. Only up to 7 items can be held, so drop the ones you don't need anymore. Mushrooms in your inventory affect your shot strength and type. The game is slightly randomized each time, so it will take multiple playthroughs to see everything.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>- Arrow keys: move<br/>- v: shoot<br/>- c: drop item<br/>- x: select next item</p>\n<p>The game <em>should</em> be playable with a USB controller using the D-Pad and right-hand buttons.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>notes:</strong><br/>This game is a fan work based on Touhou project.
