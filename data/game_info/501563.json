I even wonder if it's not directly a clone of something else, simple as it is).</p>\n<p>It's just an arcade game where you try to have the highest score by going out of infinites hoops that are coming at ya faster and faster.</p>\n<p>Hope you'll enjoy it. It was really hard to concentrate with my neighbor having a big party over my head, my roof menacing to fall and kill me every time a new song started. That's also the reason I am not taking this project beyond what it is.
