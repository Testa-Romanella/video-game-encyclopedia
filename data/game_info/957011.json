I first started posting about it to my server in 2021 though the project predates that. In fact, my first notes on this project date back to 2010.\u00a0 A single document named \"blackhole_story\".</p>\n<p>This Amare Festival version of the game is a snapshot only meant to show the artwork and concept. Most of the game features (such as the flowcharts, glossary, and affinity trackers) are not functional in this version.<br/></p>\n<p>However, this will become my full time project after Gilded Shadows is complete. There will not be any more updates for a while but I will post about the release schedule when GS is done.</p>\n<p>This is currently a sort of <strong>prototype </strong>to show some of the features and characters.</p>\n\n<strong>Summary</strong><br/>\n<p>In When Stars Collide, the player joins the crew of <em>The Ophelia</em>, a deep space exploration vessel as they uncover a trove of technology from a nearly forgotten species. Unaware that, among the items they unearth is an inhabited stasis pod, the crew recovers the found items but inadvertently awakens the occupant of the pod in the process.</p>\n<p>Upon awaking, Wil Nymera, a young interstellar wanderer, discovers they've been asleep for nearly 500 years. With nowhere else to go, Wil temporarily joins the crew after revealing they are Veleian, an ancient species known for their telepathy, incredible technology, and tendency to either guide younger races toward betterment - or else obliterate them.</p>\n<p>Wil quickly becomes the target of people seeking the near mythical home world of their father. The crew of The Ophelia find themselves caught in a struggle between ancient powers and newer factions eager to get their hands on Veleia's tech.<br/></p>\r\nPlanned Features (in final project)\r\n<ul><li><p>5 love interests with overlapping/concurrent routes</p></li><li><p>Flowcharts</p></li><li><p>Glossary</p></li><li><p>Around 450,000 words <br/></p></li><li><p>WSC comes with a small character creator allowing you to pick some of your MC's physical characteristics including hair colour and style, skin colour and pronouns.</p></li></ul>\r\nContent Advisory\r\n<p>(For the snapshot only)</p>\n<ul><li>Strong Language</li><li>References to interstellar colonisation</li></ul>\n<p>For a much more detailed view of all potentially sensitive content, please click here:</p>\n<p>Content Advisory Spreadsheet<br/></p>\r\nLove Interests\r\n\n\n<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T17:49:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a64/a640858218887df96bd1ed516a2cccbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Steamberry Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
