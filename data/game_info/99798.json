Navigate as fast as you can through the level to reach the beacons or risk facing squads of enemies already waiting for you; then use your weapons and evasive maneuvers to take them down in bright colorful explosions.</p><p>An electric neon, colorful yet sparse look is the inspiration for all the elements in the game; the setting, the player ships, enemies, visual effects and music take notes from simple vector art and electronic music.<br/></p><p>Voxel Blast was created as a love letter to 3D dogfighting games and also space shooters, in an attempt to find a common ground between those two kinds of games. In Voxel Blast you can choose one of three ships with different weapons, yet all of them very focused in providing a satisfying dog-fighting and movement experience.</p><p><strong>Minimum installation requirements:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>1GB Free Hard Drive Space</li><li>2GB RAM</li><li>1GB Dedicaded Video Card (NVidia GeForce GTX 560 or equivalent)</li></ul><p><strong>Tested operative systems:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Windows 7 x64</li><li>Windows 8.1 x64</li><li>Fedora 20 &amp; 22</li><li>Mac OS X Yosemite</li></ul><p><strong>Follow us:</strong></p><p>Facebook: /ceibasoft</p><p>Twitter: @CeibaGames </p><p>Youtube: Ceiba Software &amp; Arts Channel</p>Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/395300<p>http://www.ceibasoft.net<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c85/c85c703449b281c3b7f6a46d038915d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ceiba Software & Arts"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
