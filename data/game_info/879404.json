The brief for a course called Design for Interactive Media at University of Edinburgh prompted me to think about patina, remediation, and aura. Consequently, I applied 3D modelling techniques to imagine objects from the past, as well as\u00a0new ways in which they may be displayed in a future gallery. Highly creative brief and wonderful experience working with models form colleagues! I kept the submission report in the attached project files, for a glance into my process, and more importantly,\u00a0since the final gallery outcome contains some work from classmates with credits to each.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T15:02:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88f/88f395bef7c24cf830e0baee281ea278.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["river_tam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
