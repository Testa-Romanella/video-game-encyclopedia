It's about a little frog on a simple quest for their grandpa, collecting fishes and helping friends along the way.</p>\r\nHOW DOES IT PLAY?\r\n<p>You can use a keyboard or a controller to play our demo. You can walk, run and jump to move around, you can use your rod to fish or to solve some puzzles and you can talk with several quirky characters you find along the way.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nWHY DID\u00a0WE MAKE IT?\r\n<p>First things first, Ranita literally means \"little frog\" in spanish and that's the name we gave our main character and also the game, why? because Ranita Fishing is just a little demo that we put together for fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While making it, we discovered that we really liked collaborating and the idea could be a full game, but sadly, we lack the resources, so if you are a publisher and are interested in investing, get in contact with us, we really wanna make the whole game!<br/></p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>We are a group of friends from M\u00e9xico \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd\u00a0that decided to work together on a little game for fun. This was made in 5 months in our free time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>F\u00e1yer- Director &amp; Producer<br/>Hugo Guti\u00e9rrez - Programmer &amp; Technical Artist<br/>Kyutahub - Character Designer &amp; 3D Artist<br/>Joven Paul - 3D &amp; Concept Artist<br/>Daniel Arturo (Vala) - 3D &amp; Concept Artist<br/>Majo F\u00e9lix - Music &amp; Implementation<br/>Ricardo Cervantes - Sound Design &amp; Implementation</p>\r\n\r\nTHANKS FOR PLAYING!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T07:40:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8d/f8d91a9b876da3b80a2fa3967c7c2c24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["F\u00e1yer\ud83d\udd25"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
