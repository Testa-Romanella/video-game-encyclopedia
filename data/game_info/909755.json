The objective of the mission is to survive and kill as many enemies as possible until you die. I changed this up a little bit and made it so that you have 3 lives and once you lose all 3 lives the game will pop up with game over and you can play again. You collect Data Pyramids to gain more ammo and collect Data Cubes to gain more health.\r\n<br/><br/></p>\r\nGame and Engine Development\r\nIntroduction\r\n<p>The development log bellow highlights the key features in my development of HALO 64.

I   highlighted anything with the letter \u201cv\u201d in the .csv document to make it   easier to spawn enemies and decide where rot spawn them.\r\n      </p> <p>N/A\r\n      </p> <p>Screenshots of the .csv document are   in Appendix A.\r\n     </p> <p>The code responsible for spawning   enemies and collectibles are working as they should.\r\n      </p> <p>I used assistance from the work on the   worksheets for this.\r\n      </p> <p>The code worked as expected with help   from the .csv document to know where to spawn each object on the map.\r\n   </p><p>The code and the .csv work together to   build the map.\r\n      </p> <p>N/A\r\n      </p> <p>Screenshots of the code and .csv   document are in Appendix A.\r\n     </p> <p>I added collision into the game\r\n      </p> <p>Used assistance from the worksheets to   get this to work.\r\n      </p> <p>It worked how I intended but there are   the odd areas of the game where the collision is a bit glitchy.\r\n      </p> <p>Sometimes when you jump on the left   side of a block you can jump up the walls that I tried to make solid.\r\n      </p> <p>Screenshots of the game in Appendix A.\r\n     </p> <p>I created some custom sprites.\r\n      </p> <p>I made some custom sprites to fit the   theme of the game. These sprites are of the theme of the halo series. I used   inspiration from the internet to help me make these sprites.\r\n      </p> <p>The sprites work and load perfectly.   Some of the sprites to do with the player are a bit jittery such as when   jumping there is a bit of a jagged effect.\r\n      </p> <p>It\u2019s a bit jittery when the player   jumps.\r\n      </p> <p>A screen shot of the game running with   sprites are in Appendix A.\r\n     </p> <p>I added a custom background that   matches the platforms and walls of the game.\r\n      </p> <p>I found a background online that   matched the theme of the game.\r\n      </p> <p>I decided to go with a nice background   of the halo ring since that is a vital part of the game.\r\n      </p> <p>I didn\u2019t end up sticking with the   pixelated theme of the game with the background since I liked the way this   background looked.\r\n      </p> <p>A screenshot of the background   implemented into working game is in Appendix A.\r\n     </p> <p>I created custom platform sprites.\r\n      </p> <p>I created some platforms in the 32-bit   style of the rest of the game which fits with the rest of the game.\r\n      </p> <p>With the platforms I created 2. The   first platform is a simple grass terrain which is a one-way platform (you can   only jump up) and an alien style of hovering platform which is 2 way so you   can jump up and down the platform.\r\n      </p> <p>To jump up the platform press \u201cW\u201d\r\n   </p><p>\u00a0\r\n   </p><p>To go down the platform press \u201cS\u201d and the   \u201cup arrow key\u201d.\r\n      </p> <p>A screenshot of the platforms in the   working game are located in Appendix A.\r\n     </p>\n<p> <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\r\nTest Logs\r\n        <p>Element / test\r\n      </p> <p>Expected outcome\r\n      </p> <p>Actual outcome\r\n      </p> <p>Evidence / Fixes\r\n     </p> <p>Game run\r\n      </p> <p>when you launch the game the game runs as it was designed to.\r\n      </p> <p>Yes, the game runs as it was expected.\r\n      </p> <p>When I was building the game, I had some issues getting the background   song to play in the main game.\r\n     </p> <p>Menu page display\r\n      </p> <p>When you load the game up it will display the menu screen as   intended.\r\n      </p> <p>Yes, the menu page displayed and worked as it was expected.\r\n      </p> <p>I changed the music in the background of the menu to fit the game   better.\r\n     </p> <p>Does the player character move\r\n      </p> <p>When WASD is used the player character will move in game.\r\n      </p> <p>This worked as it was intended.\r\n      </p> <p>N/A\r\n     </p> <p>Does the character look the correct way?\r\n      </p> <p>When the player presses \u201cA\u201d or \u201cD\u201d the players character will turn to   look \u201cLeft\u201d or \u201cRight\u201d.\r\n      </p> <p>Yes, the players character faced the correct direction as intended.\r\n      </p> <p>N/A\r\n     </p> <p>Do enemies move\r\n      </p> <p>When you spawn in the game the enemies will move.\r\n      </p> <p>This worked as it was intended.\r\n      </p> <p>N/A\r\n     </p> <p>Can player shoot\r\n      </p> <p>when the \u201cSpace bar\u201d is pressed the player will shoot.\r\n      </p> <p>Yes, this is working as it was intended.\r\n      </p> <p>One fix I couldn\u2019t manage to do was line the bullets up with the   players gun, so they are a bit off.\r\n     </p> <p>Can enemies shoot\r\n      </p> <p>when the player is near the enemies, they will shoot at him. (the   bullet curves up and down towards the player)\r\n      </p> <p>This worked as it was intended.\r\n      </p> <p>This feature didn\u2019t require any fixing since the bullets aligned up   perfectly first try.\r\n     </p> <p>Players weapon fires\r\n      </p> <p>When \u201cspace bar\u201d is pressed bullets will appear.\r\n      </p> <p>This worked as intended.\r\n      </p> <p>A fix I couldn\u2019t make work is that the bullets appear too high rather   than in line with the player\u2019s gun.\r\n     </p> <p>Players take damage\r\n      </p> <p>When the player is hit by one of the enemy\u2019s laser bullets, they will   take 5 damage.\r\n      </p> <p>Yes, the player takes damage when hit by an enemy bullet.\r\n      </p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if 5 damage is enough so I might change it at a later   date but for now it is enough for me to test the game.\r\n     </p> <p>Enemies take damage\r\n      </p> <p>When the player presses \u201cSpace bar\u201d it will shoot bullets, which will   damage the enemy.\r\n      </p> <p>The enemies take damage but I\u2019m not sure it is enough damage.\r\n      </p> <p>I increased the damage the player deals to a point where I believe it   is enough to balance the game.\r\n     </p> <p>Players pick up collectables\r\n      </p> <p>The collectables consist of Data Pyramids which add more ammo, and data   Cubes which give more health.\r\n      </p> <p>The collectables work how they are supposed to.\r\n      </p> <p>I may need to change how much ammo the pyramids give you but for now   it is enough.\r\n     </p> <p>Player regenerate ammo\r\n      </p> <p>When the player goes over the Data Pyramid, they will receive more   ammo.\r\n      </p> <p>The Data Pyramids work as they are supposed to.\r\n      </p> <p>N/A\r\n     </p> <p>Player regenerates health\r\n      </p> <p>When the player goes over the Data Cube, they will receive more ammo.\r\n      </p> <p>The Data Cubes work how they are supposed to.\r\n      </p> <p>N/A\r\n     </p> <p>Does the audio play (menu screen)\r\n      </p> <p>When the player starts the game the menu screen works and the audio   plays in the background.\r\n      </p> <p>The music works as intended and there were no problems.\r\n      </p> <p>N/A\r\n     </p> <p>Does the audio play (Main Game)\r\n      </p> <p>After the menu screen the menu screen music stops and the main game   music starts to play in the background of the game as the player plays the   game.\r\n      </p> <p>The music works as intended however I had a few problems when trying   to get it to work.\r\n      </p> <p>When the game started to play it didn\u2019t want to play the music and   would just stop the menu music however, I managed to figure out what the   issue was. Evidence for this is in Appendix A.\r\n     </p> <p>Do the textures load\r\n      </p> <p>When the game is launched all the textures load as intended.\r\n      </p> <p>Yes, when the game is launched all the textures load as intended.\r\n      </p> <p>N/A\r\n     </p>\n<p> <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T20:41:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abe/abedcd42753f810ef45772b44330d59c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard Ferguson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
