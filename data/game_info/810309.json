In the same fashion, you partake in the story of Numina as a character in the form of a bodiless voice that only Shawn can hear - a guardian spirit. You can interact with Shawn and influence his decisions through dialogue choices in the game.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Branching Decisions</strong><br/>The decisions you make influences the relationship Shawn has with the other characters you'll meet in the game. Having good relationships with your party members unlocks powerful combo-attacks in battle and may open up the opportunity to take your relationship to the next level \u2665 Your decisions also influence the overall course of the story to conclude into one of the four possible endings.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Battle with the Elements</strong><br/>Engage in a round-based combat system with action inputs for some attacks that require you to make timed inputs for maximum damage! Each character also has unique elemental abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses. Incorporate this into your strategy to quickly win battles.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Explore the World of Alterna</strong><br/>Most side quests in NUMINA allow you to dive deeper into the backstory and lore of the world. But you can also explore the beautiful scenery with your grappling hook to reach higher places and find new gear, spell scrolls or rare items.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T14:51:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b5504df796269d210c1410ddc136b80d.jpg", "website": "https://numinarpg.carrd.co/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 619, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["starlit", "starlit studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["starlit studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
