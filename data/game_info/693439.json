{"id": 693439, "slug": "ratocracy", "name": "Ratocracy", "name_original": "Ratocracy", "description": "<p>In the world of rodents there exists a cruel hierarchy, much like those we humans create for ourselves. In this world rats and mice often cross paths, but mice are decidedly on the bottom\u2026 Destitute and desperate. The protagonist of the game is a small mouse, whose family and friends have been left starving in the sewers by this dystopian rodent society. The goal of the game will seemingly be to collect cheese as food for the starving lower class\u2026.BUT\u2026 As you move up in the world the mouse will forget about their roots and the focus will become about seeking power and luxury for themself alone. Each level the mouse climbs will represent a class elevation as he climbs the \u2018social ladder\u2019 (The mouse's character design will grow more and more bougie as the levels progress). When you reach the final level\u00a0 and the \u2018win state\u2019 mouse will resemble the horrid bigatous rats that they so loathed at the beginning of the game and you will have become the enemy who once oppressed you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T08:15:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee0/ee0dde99cad6a471bc84fb1fae426293.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["myleshouse", "chooseimage"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
