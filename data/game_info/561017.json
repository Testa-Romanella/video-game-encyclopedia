I understand there's a high likelihood you're not even reading this sentence right now, but like that's just the one thing I recommend. Ok now go be a gamer, my child.<strong><br/><br/>Summary -</strong><br/>Oh <strong>GOD</strong> what is\u00a0<em>HAPPENING?!?!?!?</em></p>\n<p>You, a member of the alien race, <em>Aliennus</em>, have somehow managed to<strong> UPSET EVERY OTHER ALIEN ENOUGH FOR THEM TO ALL WANT TO SLAUGHTER YOU</strong>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, you were born with a birth defect, that both made your heart blue for some reason\u00a0<em>(idk man you're an alien)</em> and the ability to <strong>DO THAT EXTRA DAMAGE ON THE BEAT</strong>.</p>\n<p>But hey, did you know aliens have\u00a0<em>adrenaline</em> too? Killing your peers gives you that\u00a0<em><strong>SWEET, SWEET ADRENALINE RUSH</strong></em>. Who knows, maybe if you get\u00a0<strong>ENOUGH OF A RUSH</strong>, your <strong>ENEMIES </strong>will <strong>FREEZE</strong> in fear?!?<br/><br/><strong>Controls -</strong><br/>Movement - WASD // Arrow keys // D-PAD<br/>Attack - Left Mouse Button // Space // A/X/B (XBox, Dualshock, Nintendo(??))<br/>Adrenaline Rush (Must have full adrenaline) - R // L1/L // L2/L<br/>Pause/Unpause - Esc // Start/Options/+ (XBox, Dualshock, Nintendon't)<br/><br/><strong>How to play -<br/></strong><em>Progression:</em><br/>Kill enemies to progress through waves. Your current wave kills and quota can be seen in the top-right.<br/><br/><em>Adrenaline:</em><br/>Killing enemies builds adrenaline. When your adrenaline is full, activate to freeze all enemies, increase BPM, and move <em>fast</em>. Adrenaline can be seen as the progress bar at the bottom of the screen.<br/><br/><em>Crits Part 1:</em><br/>Hit on beat to deal extra damage. If your attack appears yellow, this is likely because you hit on beat. You must also wait for weapon cooldown to finish.<br/><br/><em>Crits Part 2:</em><br/>Each weapon has an individual cooldown time, which restarts when you hit an enemy. You must wait for this cooldown time to finish before being able to crit again. Yellow sparks go off when the cooldown is over.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T04:21:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/68186f72a07163f06eebf8ab56826bd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Isaac", "Blue Attire"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
