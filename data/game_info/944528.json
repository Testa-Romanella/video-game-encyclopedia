Maybe it will fit you better. Hellscape follows the (so far) very beginings to a story of an angel who has fallen into hell in a... stupor. A very influential figure seems to have an interest in you, and won't let your adventure end too fast... Run around in hopes of finding an escape route, find pretty things in dangerous areas, and prepare for a beatdown! the game is both a demo and wip, but it SHOULD be stable.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Features:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>1 very annoying CEO of hell\u00a0</p>\n<p>1 FULLY SOBER main character</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A/D - Move right/left</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Shift - Dash</p>\n<p>E - Interact with object/Close checkpoint menu</p>\n<p>I - Collectibles Menu</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause Menu</p>\n<p><strong>External Assets:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music used from https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/</p>\n<p>Sound effects from\u00a0https://pixabay.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T11:06:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ce/9ce226b7c898bd466401aba59a83a636.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Somnys", "kj_stingray", "xxXwormXxx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
