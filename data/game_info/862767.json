But on the arena there may be one or more <strong>Conditions</strong> (<strong>\u201cConds\u201d</strong> for short) which, <strong>every 10 seconds</strong>, affect the game in some way (either good, like giving you a sword, or bad, like freezing you in an ice block). <strong>At least one Cond is always present</strong>: the <strong>Conditioner</strong>, which spawns other Conds every 10 seconds. Part of the fun is trying to find out what each Cond do :-)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>You can disable a Cond temporarily by interacting with it</strong> (you\u2019re probably playing on the web emulator, so it should be <strong>the F key on the keyboard</strong>). Bear in mind that Conds go away after a few activations, and by disabling them they will stay there longer.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you want to submit your <strong>high score</strong>, you can share it in the comments - just comment with the <strong>\u201cScorecode\u201d</strong> displayed on the Game Over screen (it encodes both the Score, the RNG Seed used and some checksum anticheat thingy)\r\n</p>\n<p>(PS: yes this is a legit NES ROM - the web build is just the em-FCEUX emulator running it)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T16:32:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b869253addda666a268980411b418e4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wendel Scardua"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
