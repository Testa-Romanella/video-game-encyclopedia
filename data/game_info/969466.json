You play as Lance, a novice hacker in 2033.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Starting new in the business, take easy jobs and finish them to get better paid yet more challenging contracts. Spend the money to upgrade your cyberdecks software, or save it <br/>on a protected offshore bank account.<h3>HACK ICE</h3><br/>In Cybermere, you'll have access to over a dozen different upgradeable software tools to help you hack the ICE structure. Each tool has its own unique abilities, allowing you to approach challenges in different ways and come up with creative solutions. For example, you can use the viruses to manipulate the structure of the ICE, creating openings and weakening or destroying obstacles. Or you can deploy the ICE Blaster.exe to blast through nodes and clear a path to your objective. If you prefer a more subtle approach, the ICE Probe allows you to gather information, or weaken security measures from a distance using the Hammer tool. And for close-quarters combat, the Melee.exe is a powerful weapon that can take out enemy drone or a node in a few seconds or less depending on the version. You can experiment with different combinations of tools to find the perfect strategy for success. With so many tools at your disposal, you'll have endless possibilities for scanning the ICE network and reaching the Root node.<h3>REAL TIME</h3><br/>The game is set in real time, meaning that time progresses at the same rate as it does in the real world. This adds a unique element of strategy to the game, as you'll need to plan your actions and manage your resources carefully in order to succeed. For example, you'll need to sleep in order to advance time and regain your energy, but this also means that you'll have less time to accomplish your goals. You'll need to balance your need for rest with your desire to make progress in the game, and plan your actions accordingly. Additionally, you'll need to manage your finances and resources wisely. You'll have access to various software tools and equipment, but they come at a cost. You'll need to decide how to allocate your resources in order to maximize your chances of success, and be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances as you progress through the game. Overall, the real-time element of Cybermere adds an exciting level of depth and challenge to the game, making it a must-play for fans of hacking action with a bit of strategy.<h3>DIFFERENT ENDINGS</h3><br/>In Cybermere, your choices and actions will determine the outcome of the game.
