You operate an asteroid smasher, the only ship standing between earth and an alien armada in the wake of the destruction of earth's navy. As an asteroid smasher, you have a unique ability to re-energize your ship's engines by hitting other metallic objects. Smash into two or more enemy ships in order to gain an extra turn. If you can't, use your turn to do as much damage as you can while positioning yourself outside the range of enemies.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:44:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9ab7bbe7f01e4ce09407fed29f90fd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tygamesdev"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
