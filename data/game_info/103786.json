Here the players must each spam their jump/punch keys until one of the players has no hearts left.</p><p>The game was the result of a 2 night game jam held by Kajak Games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4a5b0c9a13f22dc7c519b3c281921e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kuvis"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
