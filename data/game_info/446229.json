These paranormal objects just might help you escape this creepy facility!</p>\n\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Mouse to look<br/>E to interact</p>\n<p>While watching Markiplier play the old school SCP containment breach game, we got inspired to create our own SCP style game. We quickly developed a couple of SCP style documents. After that, we decided to create the containment rooms for those objects. The idea is that IF we could pull off making a couple of containment rooms then theoretically it shouldn't be too hard to keep going, containment room by containment room, and then build a random level generator to stitch all the rooms together. This quick game demo is our ability to conquer the first two rooms and see how a project like this would tend to flesh out for future development. <br/></p>\n<p>Let us know if you enjoyed the experience and atmosphere. If you feel like this is something you'd like to see more of in the future, go ahead and support us by purchasing the downloadable version. Also let us know of any bugs, issues, or opinions in the comments! <br/></p>\n<p>Go check out our other games too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T05:31:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c4b59e95fbd6aff973b25963fdc4f55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Invade Tech Software"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
