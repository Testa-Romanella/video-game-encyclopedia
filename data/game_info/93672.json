Joined at the waist, you and your partner share a long, wriggling body as you wrestle your opponents for control of the ball. Since you're sharing the same body, you'll need to carefully communicate (or just shout a lot). With every action affecting both you and your partner, PMPY combines the best parts of co-op multiplayer with the worst parts of your last breakup. </p><ul><li>Frantic local multiplayer gameplay in the vein of Sportsfriends or Towerfall.</li><li>Compete in multiple game types that will test your friendship in different ways, or play around in a sandbox area filled with toys and secrets.</li><li>Low on controllers? Share a controller with a friend or try controlling two heads simultaneously - a two-player game can be played with just one controller!</li><li>Accessible yet deep - play it as a noisy party game or hold a fiercely competitive grudge match.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d9f4ddc128d75cc9ed7419649a7fe80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["House House"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
