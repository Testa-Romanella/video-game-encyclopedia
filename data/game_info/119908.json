They had an Apple Macintosh computer, on which there was a game called \"Barrack\" by Ambrosia Software. I thought the game was one of the coolest things ever, and when I got home, I was unhappy that I could not play it, because I did not have a Mac, but a PC with DOS/Windows (3.1 I think it was at the time).</p>\n<p>I found some game called \"Jezzball\" on the internet, but even though it employed a very similar gameplay concept, that game lacked the variety of different ball types and I thus found it boring compared to Barrack.</p>\n<p>Having no other way to play the game, and being the avid QBASIC programmer I was at the time, the logical solution was to program my own version of the game.</p>\n<p>Since it is a DOS executable, you will need to use DOSBox to run this game (unless you still run DOS on your computer, in which case you are pretty badass).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/8894c885830fcd1b02be0078233857e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kittenm4ster"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
