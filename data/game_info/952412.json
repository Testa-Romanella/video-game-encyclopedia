The game can run on mobile, but unfortunately, it has a fixed resolution of 800x600 and it doesn't display well on most devices.</strong></p>\n<p>Bringing role-playing to philosophy and the issue of personal identity. Realms of PlayCraft is part of a bigger social study on digital personal identity formation and visualization.</p>\n<p>The aim of the project was to collect anonymous data and perform a series of data analyses on the subject of perceived digital identity. As a standalone prototype, no data is collected and the process of creating a character is purely for fun or role-play.</p>\n<p>Realms of PlayCraft presents an imaginative more nuanced and complex character creation, that would probably be too cumbersome for most commercial video games. On the other hand, experimental games and future MMOs would benefit from more choices in character creation. Of course, without a meaningful differentiation, it would all lead to nothing.</p>\n<p>So for now, just enjoy creating a new you in The Realms of PlayCraft.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T08:01:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/500/500647a68edbcc4998dfcc361d1348ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bogdaan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
