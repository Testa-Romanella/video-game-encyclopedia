It contains two modes (Defend and Attack) and five difficulties.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How\u00a0to\u00a0play - Defend</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is really simple. You're standing in one place and shooting enemies that are coming closer. Shoot with Space, Alt, E, Enter or left-click.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play - Attack</strong></p>\n<p>This is a bit more complicated. You're moving and the enemies are standing. You're shooting them and they're trying to shoot you. If your bullet and an enemy's bullet collide, both of them are destroyed. Move with AD or arrows, shoot with the same controls as in Defend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bfb0e181f2e1c86ae6a822ca7f70430.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["frankenstein7"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
