This experiment is meant only for college graduates who are going through some sort of emotional distress.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mitron, the guide sent by the CRR Corp. organization, compelled Ava to join the special secret experiment called CRR experiment which directly benefits the CRR Corp. research on Robotics who are yet to perfect humanoid robots in order to bring a huge revolution in the field. It happened just after he failed to confess his feelings to his crush, Yui, on the day of his college graduation ceremony. He regretted not telling her sooner and that he had lost the chance to take the first step because another guy from his class already asked her out.<br/><br/>Ava along with the various other unknown 'test subjects' had been chosen for the experiment in which they were teleported to a parallel world called 'messed up' world which was basically a post-apocalyptic world where they were allowed to explore, interact with the people and robots. Every robot and 'test subject' had unique roles to play in that world. However, Ava was given the role of an adventurer who had to kill the creatures to survive and to rescue Yui at any cost. According to Mitron, Ava's guide, the Robot girls were somehow related to the real world girls. He came across the various girls in the world but among them, Hana was the one to actually change the course of his journey. Ava, despite having social anxiety, became friends with her because of her warm personality. <br/><br/>Things took a darker turn when Hana got kidnapped by the giant Goat Bot and it gave Ava another reason to continue his journey while surviving at the same time.<br/><br/>You play as Ava, the adventurer of the Parallel world, and will you be able to rescue Yui and Hana and more importantly, complete your CRR experiment? <br/><br/><h3>Key Features:</h3><ul><li>15 levels with stunning visuals!</li></ul><ul><li>The various kinds of enemies having different weapons!</li></ul><ul><li>3 Boss battles along with a mini boss battle!</li></ul><ul><li>Lots of deadly traps and obstacles to overcome! </li></ul><ul><li>3 Firing Modes and the ability to double jump! </li></ul><ul><li>Collect items like health, ammo, money etc. </li></ul><ul><li>Story Driven.
