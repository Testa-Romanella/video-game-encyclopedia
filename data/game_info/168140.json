The prompt words were 'cascade', 'sundown', and 'split'. One of the other teams were brainstorming ideas and someone mentioned splitting a bullet in half with another bullet. This got me thinking about the thing you see (usually in cartoons) of a really good archer splitting another arrow, so I decided to make a game about that. Or, at least, a game in which you can do that.</p><p>In <em>Archery </em>you are an archer practicing your skills in a boat under a waterfall at sundown. There's no specific single goal. Rather, try doing what you want to do and check how well you went once the sun has set and the statistics appear. </p><p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p><p>Gamepad: left thumbstick to aim. Hold 'A' (Xbox) or 'X' (PS4) to charge a shot, then release to fire. Hopefully. I've only tested it with a Dualshock4 on OSX. </p><p>Keyboard: Left/right to rotate aiming reticule. Hold space to charge a shot, then release to fire. </p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Need to press 'k' to toggle keyboard controls on/off.<br/></p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #18 of 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49a/49aec0947ad2d431c838829bb45c3625.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
