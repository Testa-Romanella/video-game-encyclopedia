Its not going to be easy however... Between parts of the rover breaking down and the time delay between your inputs and the rover responding, things  are going to be messy. Oh and did I forget to mention, the battery is constantly draining. Make sure to find and collect green battery packs and blue repair kits to keep the little rover going strong!</p>\n<p>Each <strong>green</strong> battery pack restores 25% of the battery.<br/>Each <strong>blue</strong> repair kit restores one broken part.</p>\n\n\n<p>Breakable parts:<br/>Wheels: the wheels on either side can break, slowing that side down and causing the rover to constantly veer to the side.<br/>Solar Panels: When broken the battery charge drops faster.<br/>Communications dish: When broken it increases the delay between your actions and the rover's movement. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/380/380cc58e309d3d26e2b93fe702cfeb2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sisyphean Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
