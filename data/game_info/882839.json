Built entirely with synthesizers that react to the environment in real-time, it is\u00a0an exploration of ephemeral spaces and procedurally-generated ambient music systems.</p>\n<p>While these worlds are primarily explored with sound, each are paired with colorful and relaxing visualizations. From scenic desert vistas to psychedelic oceanic depths, they are a meditation on fresh audiovisual themes.</p>\n\r\nThe game\r\n\r\nExpand to read more about the gameplay.\r\n<p>Today you awoke from cryogenic sleep. The exosuit that protects you greets you: Welcome to Alpha Periphery. You were hired by the system's licensed corporation as a surveyor to assess its value. As you walk the shifting desert beneath you, it becomes clear there are more mysteries than rare metals to uncover. This is your strangest job yet.</p>\n<p>In Periphery Synthetic EP, surveyors pilot an upgradeable exosuit across otherworldly lands. Equipped with only a scanner and limited cargo space, they gather the materials to synthesize and upgrade suit components. In their mission to understand the Alpha Periphery system, they note scientific observations and significant planetary features in their codex, which they can revisit at any time.</p>\n<p>Each side introduces a new world to explore, containing new challenges to overcome and secrets to discover. These inspire surveyors to develop new movement abilities, which they can bring back to previous worlds for a fresh experience. By the end of their expedition, they might expect to drive, fly, swim, and even manipulate spacetime itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T20:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d7/0d780cec822627fa50dafb17693f5ae7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["shiftBacktick"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
