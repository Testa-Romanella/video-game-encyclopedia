In the meantime I'm interested in seeing users\r\nthoughts on the current state of the product. </p>\n<p><strong>General plot</strong>: Grogar has returned from the realm\r\nof darkness with Tambelon and is kidnapping ponies. Megan and Co use\r\nParadise Estate as a safe space from Grogar\u2019s forces. The player is\r\nattacked by Troggles and flees their glade to unite with Megan and\r\nhelp her put an end to Grogar\u2019s siege on Dream Valley.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Along the way you team up with Firefly, Applejack, and Sweet Stuff\r\nwho have various motivations for helping you.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Turn based RPG. There are some visual\r\nnovel elements in that there is a lot of multi choice questions and a\r\nromance factor to keep track of as well as a day counter but beyond\r\nthat there\u2019s nothing else and this is a Dragon Quest inspired game\r\nso there are random encounters and the game play does lean on being\r\nslightly harder than the average RPG maker game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you are an RPG maker fan this should be all right. You\u2019ll\r\nwant a more professional looking product I imagine but you might\r\nenjoy the fundamentals of what I was aiming for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you like MLP you should get a lot out of it as it\u2019s packed\r\nwith references to lore from G1 and G4 as well as characters from\r\nboth generations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Random encounters are filled bad guys and monsters inspired by or\r\ndirectly are bad guys from the franchise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you like Dragon Quest music this is your game. Most of the\r\nmusic in the game is from Dragon Quest and it\u2019s from various Dragon\r\nQuest games as well. A lot of it is from symphonic albums or\r\nre-releases of snes era games so the music is sometimes a little too\r\nemotional for the visuals but it is really nice music so hopefully it\r\ndoesn\u2019t give you too much dissonance.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Future Objectives</strong>: Ideally the game will have you\r\nplay over several generations and after I'm done with my current\r\nproject I'll add another generation so that players can really\r\nexperience that idea in action. #rpg #MLP #Dragonquest #fangame\r\n#RPGmaker #turnbasedRPG</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f65/f65b639ba2dd0bd94aca6c4fa6d6ce2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Odaswifteye"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
