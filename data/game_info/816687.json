Takes about 15-30 minutes to complete. Game made entirely with RPG Maker VX Ace game engine and its internal assets and resources. No scripts were used.<strong><br/>CW: Mild unreality.<br/><br/></strong>Hi everyone! I finished my entry for My first game jam, The Predictability of Fate! It\u2019s free to download, so please play it &lt;3</p>\n<p>This game was a challenge to limit myself to the resources of the game engine instead of making my own assets (which is what I do for my usual projects, not that any of them are released yet). So I thought, why not play with the player's expectation and add a twist to that?...</p>\n<p>I hope you like it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T07:46:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e20/e203ca153f7056e9af6ae82f0a3b704a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vel Lori"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
