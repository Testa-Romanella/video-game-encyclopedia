Strike after strike to flatten or bend metal. Cut wooden boards, sticks and branches by grasping the saw handle and moving it back and forth. Tie ropes, attach chains. Push the levers of the tongs. Bring flasks to the blanks, spill potions. Use magic books to enchant blades, shields and armor! There are over 100 unique and repeatable schemes, as well as a free-to-play forge mode.<br/><br/><br/>Much of what you find during your wanderings will prove useful in the forge. The properties of items and character skills are revealed in combinations with each other. It's no secret, for example, that dwarves are more willing to work in the forge if you put a couple of kegs of beer in the house!<br/><br/><br/>You have a journey ahead of you, blacksmith. You have seen it in your dreams. And now they lead you. So embrace it. Embark on your adventure and face your destiny!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T09:45:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a090913b967eff7c9938039d9a9aae91.jpg", "website": "https://sites.google.com/view/blacksmith-song-of-two-kings/eng", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pavel Leksin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pavel Leksin"], "esrb_rating": null}
