This is a story about Arnalze, a hero spun as a false savior. There are a lot of ways to approach playing this game. There are several scenarios that change based on what you've accomplished in the game.<br/>This game is a departure from traditional JRPGs, in that characters, for the most part, do not level up, and that player choices are more effective than power-ups--although the power ups can be necessary... I'd say this has a pretty steep difficulty, and a learning curve--but ultimately, I hope that it is a fun game to speed run.<br/>You may want to read the game guide.<br/><br/>Known errors:<br/>-- Entering Katria while Quisandra is dead.
