To solve a puzzle, players need to think how to lay the tracks from stations to stations, fitting the count of needed tracks and making sure all the stations are\u00a0<strong>linked</strong>.</p>\n<p>These are the detailed rules:</p>\n<p>1. The tracks can only be laid\u00a0<strong>vertical</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>horizontal</strong>\u00a0between two different stations.<br/>2. The tracks will not cross over other tracks or stations.<br/>3. At most,\u00a0<strong>double tracks</strong>\u00a0can be laid between two stations.<br/>4. The numbers on stations are the total count of tracks, laying in four directions of the station that will need to be met.<br/>5. All stations must be linked eventually, i.e. the trains can drive to every station.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T09:48:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f37/f376831108dc2a24662fceb4534e8ab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Poly Poly Games", "Husky", "KibiGames", "blueslee"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
