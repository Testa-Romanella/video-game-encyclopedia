They have the habit to\u00a0create platforming challenge that leave a mark on any player\u00a0that never fades with time. And yet the new followup, Ninjascape, Message of the victory, successfully builds on that distinctive gameplay in a way that doesn\u2019t just retread the same ground. There\u2019s more breadth, detail, choice, and diversity than ever, and it\u2019s all done with engrossing color and light and an excellent, inspiring soundtrack. Once again the studio leaves us with a masterpiece that shows us there's still room for inovation in this media.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:23:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12d/12d9e5a032a94f7fa9f5fa0078948b88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gaetan Depin", "nathangranet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
