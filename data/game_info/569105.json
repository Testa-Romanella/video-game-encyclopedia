Based on the Japanese art of pottery repair known as \u201ckintsugi\u201d, your goal is to repair Sugi as they navigate through each unique and increasingly-difficult level. Run, ramp, and jump (w, a, s, d, and space bar) to roll around in the gold glue, and get your body back. Can you beat all the levels and make our hero whole again?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Made for AIE USA\u2019s Virtual Game Jam 2021.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theme: Broken but Beautful\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time: 46 hours\u00a0</p>\n<p>Software used:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unity\u00a0</p>\n<p>Visual Studio Code\u00a0</p>\n<p>GitHub</p>\n<p>GitKraken\u00a0</p>\n<p>Procreate</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:27:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/02191e3c7a03dc13d2ee030ec9a0a515.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baradoros", "frecklex", "TheZodiacLord", "cyanyaide", "lucasCampCode"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
