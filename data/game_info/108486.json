{"id": 108486, "slug": "of-pith-and-pumpkins", "name": "Of Pith and Pumpkins", "name_original": "Of Pith and Pumpkins", "description": "<p><strong>Grow prize-winning pumpkins in a graveyard in this non-violent feel-good game!</strong></p>\n<p>As the pumpkin caretaker, your job is to wrangle stubborn glowing ghost orbs and summon them to your pumpkins to make them grow.</p>\n<p>Watch out for evil spirits that are also attracted by your summons - you'll need to draw them away from your pumpkins. Tip: They wander more slowly on their own.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for #Darktober2017 and #ElderberryJam. The game jams' themes are \"ghost story\" and \"summoning\" respectively.<br/></p>\n<p>There are only 4 levels so far. More levels will come if there is interest.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<strong>Move</strong>WASD or Arrow Keys<strong>Summon nearby orbs (to yourself)</strong><br/>Hold Spacebar<br/><strong>Restart Level</strong>R<strong>Skip Level</strong>/<strong>Quit</strong>Escape\r\n\n<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong>\u00a0Evil orbs wander around more slowly on their own. Pull them to the far corners of the graveyard to get them out of the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong>\u00a0You can push smaller lightweight pumpkins around the graveyard.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong>\u00a0The closer you are to an orb, the stronger the attraction when summoning. Gently tap the spacebar to draw them closer.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip 4:</strong>\u00a0If bad orbs are too close to the good ones, just wait a few seconds without summoning and the good ones will disperse and spread out quickly. Strategic patience is the key.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tools: </strong>Unity, Blender, Substance Painter, Audacity, Gimp</p>\n<p><strong>Third-Party Attributions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Music: Darkest Child by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com).
