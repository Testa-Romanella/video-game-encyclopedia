It's a small, pretty unpolished top down\u00a0Old Western\u00a0wave shooter that features a fairly interesting core mechanic at it's heart, that being a magic revolver which changes it's ammo type and ammo count randomly with each reload. Made by 4 people managing different sides of the project (Programming/Tech, UI, VFX, and Music) it was a fun collaborative challenge\u00a0and an interesting first participation in a Game Jam! We originally wanted to have much more complete visuals, a more roguelike layout dungeon generation layout\u00a0and a boss fight, but time is not a very good friend of ambition. We hope\u00a0you can get some\u00a0enjoyment out of this little project!<br/></p>\n<p>Pointers:</p>\n<p>The red D6 on the hammer represents your health</p>\n<p>The icons on the left side barrel reel\u00a0represent the current Ammo Type you have</p>\n<p>The numbers on the right side barrel reel represent your Ammo Count\u00a0</p>\n<p>New waves of enemies spawn several times a minute</p>\n<p>Kill 100 Enemies to win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T05:22:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/364/364315fafabd1ac9ee7da6507e3eadd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gungus"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
