You can find it here :<br/>http://store.steampowered.com/app/540870/ <br/><br/>Following is the old description of the jam project :<br/>MechaNician was supposed to be a 2 VS 2\r\nmecha combat game.</p><p>\"The concept of the game is\r\nthat you control an engineer inside a giant robot. You can move freely and\r\nactivate its various abilities by pressing buttons in different rooms. </p><p>You are 2 inside your\r\nmecha, and you will have to coordinate with your buddy to defeat your\r\nopponent's mecha. With the fight being very slow, you will have the time to\r\nanticipate attacks and react properly.\"</p><p>this is what the game was supposed to be, but due to a bug we were not abble to finish it like we wanted. We are working hard to rebuild the whole game from scratch, so stay tuned, a playable version should be out soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4f/e4f3deb318e8da3bd98c6c1dabeb8846.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas Terryn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
