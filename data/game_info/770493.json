I suspect it is some problem with my code but I unfortunately didn't have time to fix it. All I did was increased the bullet speed so it ran faster when built. I am a bit worried though that the speed is still somehow not frame-rate independent so I hope it is still challenging. <br/></p>\n<p>And WebGL builds still seems to hate me at the moment. I will have to see if I can get it sorted.</p>\n<p>Game designed in Unity by Circumpunk-KKB<br/></p>\n<p>Resource list:</p>\n<p>Available from the Unity Asset Store:</p>\n<ul><li>Playmaker by Hutong Games</li><li>Scifi Arsenal by Archanor FX </li><li>Camera Filter Pack by Vetasoft</li><li>\u00a0Corgi Engine by More Mountains </li><li>Flatkit by Dusty Room </li><li>Hologram Shader by Peter Lu </li><li>Polygon Sci-fi Space by Synty Studios </li><li>Scifi Drones by Lukas Bobor </li><li>Fantasy Shield Pack FREE by Headwards </li><li>Pro Sound Collection by Gamemaster Audio </li><li>Sc-Fi Music by Theo Prior Music</li></ul>\n<p>Models available from Sketchfab under Creative Commons Attribution<br/></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Android Head Base Form(yo Oc) by lionarts3d</li><li>Floating robot by nada.elshorbagi </li><li>Cyber Orb by Tycho Magnetic Anomaly</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:38:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1c/f1c0f512a6a230a402739b967d7aadc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Circumpunk"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
