Just before the project started, I had recently decided that game dev was a passion I wanted to pursue with everything I've got. I switched majors and haven't looked back since.\u00a0Everything found in the game was made by me except for the visual art/sprites as well as some particle systems. Personally crafted gameplay and menu music! Asteroid Slayer served to kickstart my learning as I took it on only 1-2 months after picking up Unity for the first time!</p>\n<p>The initial idea was to release this game commercially as a mobile game\u00a0alongside a friend (who did the visual art), however things did not go as planned and the project is currently on hold.\u00a0I won't be taking donations on this project as I am not the only one who contributed to the state that it is in.\u00a0Nonetheless, it would be a waste not to put it out there as a free PC port for some to enjoy!\u00a0Super happy with the way the game turned out and can't wait to make more.\u00a0Enjoy</p>\r\nEndless Waves\r\n<p>Yep, you read that right! The game progresses infinitely, technically. Let's see how far you can make it.</p>\r\nBoss Fights\r\n<p>Each asteroid type has a unique boss variant with their own mechanics.</p>\r\nChallenge 'stroids\r\n<p>Watch out for the challenge asteroids! The angle 'stroid must be dealt with carefully... Make sure you line up your slash properly or things won't end well.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<ul><li>This version is created solely for Mouse +\u00a0Keyboard</li><li>Click and drag to send the samurai in a desired direction<br/>\n</li><li>Carefully utilize slow motion (occurs throughout combos/slashing)\u00a0to alter the pace of the game</li><li>Don't let asteroids past the left of the screen\u00a0or they'll damage the barrier</li><li>Chain as many asteroids as you can - the longer the chain the faster you slash, BUT be careful as your slow motion slowly fades away too!<br/>\n</li><li>Sheathe your sword to activate the destruction of currently chained asteroids</li><li>Grab hearts to restore some of the barrier's integrity</li></ul>\r\nFuture Possibilities/Additions\r\n<ul><li>Cosmetic system with swappable pieces (arms, legs, chest, helmet, sword) and trail customization</li><li>Loot drop system - Unique boss variants that rarely occur but drop cosmetics</li><li>Challenge system - Complete challenges for special cosmetics/achievements</li><li>Leaderboards</li></ul>\n<p>(Compatible with: Windows + Mac)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T07:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dc/7dcd03703e3118b49a9ffb8b92006f42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rozeface"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
