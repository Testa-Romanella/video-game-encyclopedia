{"id": 850831, "slug": "fractured-online", "name": "Fractured Online", "name_original": "Fractured Online", "description": "Fractured Online is a dynamic, open-world sandbox MMORPG, where you define your own destiny.<br/><br/>The unique knowledge and talent system allows skills to be discovered, learned and mastered quickly, providing new and core players with a unique experience right from the start. With the action beginning from day one, enemies are defeated through skill and cleverness, not equipment or level. <br/><br/>No set paths mean limitless adventure. You decide whether you explore the vast, interactive fantasy worlds, fight monsters and other players in dynamic PvE and PvP battles, gather resources, craft and enchant unique items, setup a trade empire, or grow your virtual home into a prosperous city by cooperating with other settlements or conquering them. <br/><br/>Become the hero you always wanted to be! Less grind. More freedom and adventure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fractured Online is the first open-world sandbox MMORPG mixing action combat with fully dynamic environments, appealing equally to lovers of competitive and cooperative gameplay. Jump right into the fray from day one. Learn and memorize the best skills to defeat your enemies through planning and cleverness, not equipment or level. Gather resources, craft, trade, explore and fight in your legendary adventure as a solitary hero, or start a settlement with your guild and grow it into the next empire.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore three different, ever-changing worlds in your own way and help to shape them to your liking. What has been true the last time you visited a place, is very likely to be different today. Roaming monsters, growing settlements and a constant day and night cycle will grant you a new experience every day. Make sure to adapt and leverage the world in the best way possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fractured Online breaks the boundaries of the typical MMO genre by bringing the combat style you\u2019ve loved in single-player Action RPGs into a complex\u00a0sandbox universe. Learn\u00a0to aim, dodge and master over 400 abilities and 40\u00a0unique status effects. Defeat your enemies, learn their abilities and\u00a0master them for yourself.\u00a0Only your skills and tactics will lead you to\u00a0victory!\u00a0If you can\u00b4t succeed in a certain situation, have a rest, memorize a new skillset and try again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finding a broadsword in the corpse of a rat sounds a little unlikely? Forget about old RPG clich\u00e9s and enter a world where every item is crafted by players. Exploit the uneven distribution of resources to get high profits when trading at faraway markets \u2013 but make sure you reach your destination alive! You decide if you want to craft and upgrade your own equipment, or rather spend your hard-earned money to browse the player auctions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking for a new home? Find a suitable location in one of the player-run cities to build your house or start a new settlement with your guild. Every city is as unique as the players contributing with\u00a0their individual styles.\u00a0As a governor, you\u2019ll be able to guide its development into a social, trading, or military hub. Beware, though: the rise to power of your city won\u2019t\u00a0go unnoticed, so get\u00a0ready to protect it from hostile raids and sieges!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking for the extra kick? Asteroids host highly competitive end-game PVP events. Travel there through one of the mysterious stargates and find death or glory. Gather scarce resources or fight for control and influence for your guild, climbing to the top of the leader boards &amp; bringing home relics to advance your settlement.<h3>Join Discord</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T09:00:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/977d6837f98a1a68cbc839cc46ab109f.jpg", "website": "https://fracturedonline.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 504, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dynamight Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["gamigo US"], "esrb_rating": null}
