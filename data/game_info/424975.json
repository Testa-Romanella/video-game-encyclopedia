We\u00a0challenged ourselves to merge the real time strategy genre with a first person dungeon crawler.</p>\n<p>As the player you are in charge of three drones (in red) to fight groups of enemy drones (in blue). Drones come in three types: ranged, melee and shield - they counter each other.<br/>Clear the level from all enemy drones to win the game. If you lose all of your drones, take too much damage yourself or fall of the map you lose.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nTEAM\r\n<p>Alois Amadeus Eisbrenner (twitter)<br/>John Kees (twitter, itch.io)<br/>Laurin Grossmann (twitter, itch.io)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:57:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe7/fe71e8d6b1b99ad1de0f9e7c2c3faded.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John", "Knusbert"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
