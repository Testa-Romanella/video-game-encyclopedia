This means that while the game does feature actual players, there are no team names or logos. The teams wear uniforms without logos and are only named by their city (the teams that share the cities of Chicago and New York are separated by having either an A or N after their name, denoting their league).</p>\n<p>The main menu theme is a cover of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f71/f71df2b8e374e227567eeca2baadcd22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Tecmo"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Tecmo"], "esrb_rating": null}
