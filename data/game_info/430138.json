Logs, mushroom, rafflesias, web material...</p>\n<p>Use the materials you've found to create state-of-the-art makeshift equipment! I\u00a0mean, Dominique isn't a blacksmith. Can't be good at everything.</p>\n<p>\u00b7Base-building lite elements!<br/><br/>As you explore the island, you will find multipe station kits which will allow you to make a variety of items. From healing potions, weapons and armors, to poisons! Find yoursef within the safety of a safe house (like a tent in the middle of the tundra or a forgotten farmhouse on the grassland) in order to install your new shinny crafting station! Spots within each base are limited, and so are the number of savepoints you can make. Installing a station is a permanent act!</p>\n\n<p>\u00b7Pick your battes!<br/><br/>Don't rush blindly into battle! Dominique is not a warrior, and wil not gain combat experience by defeating enemies. There is nothing to be gained from combat... albeit, maybe there is a tool that lets you get items from defeated enemies.</p>\n\n<p>\u00b7Zelda-like exploration!<br/><br/>Increase your chances of survival by finding crafting stations, bases,\u00a0 shortcuts, materials, and even HP and Gauge increases! It might be wise to keep these in your inventory instead of rushing to increase your health, though.</p>\n\n<p>\u00b7Find the fate of the research squad, and unveil the secret of the island!</p>\n<p>\u00b7Multiple endings!<br/><br/>Not in the demo!
