Since it's Pygame it could probably be ported to Mac and Linux, but the original prototype only included the Windows executable (and I don't have a Mac or Linux box to try that out anyway). </p><p>There's also a Github Repo of the non-compiled source if you'd like to clone the source or whatever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3e/c3e38915ef8e7dfed56e7acede98ea49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sir TapTap"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
