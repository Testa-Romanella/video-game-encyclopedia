Sound is royalty free taken from the web\u00a0as well as the music (which is from Purple Planet).</p>\n<p>The game was made for an event on the university where I study where the challenge is to create a game in one week.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's about a pirate that ransacks other pirates' ships using a huge blunderbuss that has an extremely powerful recoil, capable of making him fly.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD or ARROWS - Move left and right. Press down or up while shooting to shoot down or up. Shooting down is very important because you can fly with it.</p>\n<p>J or Z- Shoot. You have infinite ammo but the more you shoot the hotter your gun gets and when the heat bar is full you cannot shoot anymore and must wait for your weapon to cool off.</p>\n<p>K or SPACE - Jump.</p>\n<p>Use the extreme weapon recoil to your advantage, be careful where and when you fire it. The goal is to reach the end and beat the boss.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is appreciated, thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/380/3809f214b2ace87456bc522b7c4f4148.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FelipeDermann"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
