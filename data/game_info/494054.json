It takes place in a city made from an amalgamation of the old Ottoman buildings I\u00a0grew up with in Beirut. In the game the\u00a0city is under devastating attack and all you can do is delay the unavoidable\u00a0before you\u00a0inevitably fail to save the place you love.</p>\n<p>It was developed as a backer reward for the\u00a0successful Kickstarter campaign\u00a0to support the opening of the\u00a0Wonderville arcade in Brooklyn. It was exclusive to backers for a year and the complete game was scheduled for public release in August 2020.</p>\n<p>On August 4, 2020 a massive explosion ripped through the port of Beirut, horrifically realizing the fears that inspired this game. Out of respect for the dead and in mourning for the city that raised me <strong>I\u00a0have removed from the public version of the game the antagonists,\u00a0the bombs, the explosions,\u00a0</strong><strong>the smoke, the inevitable loss.</strong> You are free to fly the skies in peace.</p>\n<p>All proceeds from this game will go towards the reconstruction of Beirut.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T03:19:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d95e08e52e1496291812aa3a06e22b68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ramsey Nasser"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
