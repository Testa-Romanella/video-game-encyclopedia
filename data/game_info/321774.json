But don't be fooled by their adorable little faces, Hockey Hockey Club is a die-hard hockey game with all the usual hockey stuffs (5 on 5 games, faceoffs, one timers, bodychecks, one on ones , ...) and a twist of arcadey moves (super shots, flips, slowmo...).</p>\n<p>Eight teams of determined hockey players are present in the game with a <strong>lot of statistics</strong> for all the numbers fans: stamina, speed, handling, shoot... Pick the best teammates to defeat the other teams!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Play against the computer</strong> (3 levels of difficulty), or <strong>play with your friends locally</strong> (for up to 4 players).

I've been fiddling with this Hockey Hockey Club game for 4 months now, and I don't know if I should keep a small scope, or if I should go for a fully fleshed sports game with season/franchise mode, player customization,..., or even if I should drop it plain and simple.</p>\n<p>So please,<strong> I need your feedback</strong>, on everything: is the game fun? is the game hard? is the game running smoothly? do you see yourself playing more of it? what feature would you be adding?...\u00a0 Every comment or remark will be helpful.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, the demo is limited to only 2 teams, only exhibition matches of 90 seconds, but you can enjoy all of the 3 AI levels, play with your friends locally or even remotely with Parsec\u00ae.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T06:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4d/b4d6e1e60a7dbfc562b3962ab4499461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oddly Shaped Pixels"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
