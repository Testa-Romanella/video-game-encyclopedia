Throughout the adventure.</p>\n<p>The game has three levels of difficulty: easy, normal and hard. The amount of\u00a0hearts\u00a0that\u00a0Rayman\u00a0has depends on the difficulty (four in easy, three in normal and one in hard). The player can find\u00a0stars\u00a0throughout the levels: collecting 60 of them gives\u00a0Rayman\u00a0an extra\u00a0life.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T06:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a35/a35ceee3844b6d1dbf525f4da3e49d9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Infante The Penguin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
