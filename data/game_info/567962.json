Somewhere along your journey, something made its way into the ship. Soon, the crew began to change. It started with one. He was found covered in what looked like black slime, and then he became aggressive and started making these weird noises. Not long after this, it started spreading rapidly throughout the ship. Now you're the only one left, and you'll have to find the escape pod access codes located in the lab. But the rest of the crew has turned, and there is danger around every corner. . . .</p>\n<p>Requiem is a brief sci-fi space themed game created for Game Production at UCF during the Spring 2021 semester by Austin Michaud, Levi Elliott Smith, Jorden Little, Timmothy Tapia, and Nicholas Martin.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T11:48:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c7/9c74c2f6175beb933474054f9f53f4d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tim Tapia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
