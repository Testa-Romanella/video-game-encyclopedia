Powering up after a night of charging, you find yourself trapped in an ever-expanding set of hallways, and the only way out is to use conveniently placed mirrors to direct the laser beam to a sphere-like target device. But be careful, you have a limited charge!</p>\n<p>Created for the Mirror Game Jam. Future development is possible, if people like this, but I make no guarantees.</p><p>Music credit:\u00a0</p><p>\"Intuit\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/lic...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc4/fc41b550dad085cb7b26231e1f9eb621.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fobok"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
