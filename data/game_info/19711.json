I'm Candice innit (that's me up in the photo, the biggest one as I am well important), and this is an Action RPG all about the incredibly trick lifestyle of me and my m8s!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo basically, I was going 2 get myself a new fake tan one day, when an evil singing sensation named Krystal turns up &amp; startz causing havoc innit?!? Naturally I wasn't having that, and tried 2 stop her. Sadly I failed, and she stole my mate's tanning business.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll was lost. But then I remembered I have magical powers! I can shoot out magical bulletz in every direction, like some sort of human twin stick space ship or something! I used this knowledge to go on an adventure around the world to learn new magical powers, and ended up saving both the world and the tanning business!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI had loads of fun along the way, did a bit of rapping (I am a well good rapper tbh), made new friends and had a few romances as well!!! Basically it was a right laugh, and u can experience it all in my new action rpg!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCandice Xxxxx", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c6/4c6f433915c889be4ec2693aa1642a77.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/candiceisfit", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Havishamone Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Havishamone Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
