The game was created  for the GMTKJam 2020 with the theme 'out of control'. <br/>Inspired by Pixar's short film <em>Lifted</em>, the player has to abduct a human\u00a0\u00a0as fast as they can by pressing literally any key on keyboard, mouse and controller! The players input gets randomized each game round and every single key makes the spaceships's beam perform a different action. Abducted was made by Jan Pl\u00e4hn and Ana Laura Martinez in 48 hours.<br/><br/>Players can upload their time to the online ranking score board :)</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Every Button or Key - Move,\u00a0 Dash or Rotate\u00a0</p>\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/564/5647785c36e0ded7647d3c6bd1321ec9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fat Duck Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
