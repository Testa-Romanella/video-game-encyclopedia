I was going to make a #flatgame for the #flatgame jam but I downloaded the Unity project and had no idea what to do with it/there was no documentation. So I started a new thing with the Unity plugin Fungus, which I hadn't used before, but has super-good documentation. In the end I used the animation script from the flatgame project to help make the background. And the rest was pretty simple.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe piece of writing is a re-purposing of a piece for performance I made about the Great Flood of '53, a Storm Surge in which thousands of people on the East Coast of England, and the West Coast of The Netherlands died, and which has been called the UK's 'largest peacetime disaster'. This bit isn't about the Flood, just about the East Coast of Lincolnshire (the county of England I come from). This is maybe one tenth of the full piece, which is told in a series of fragments.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d39/d397a557005da3680b2de9dbbb53ebe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["hannahnicklin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
