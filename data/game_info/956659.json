You can buy a ROM version of the game here, and use it with a Neo-Geo emulator<em> (MAME recommended)</em> or play it on real hardware through a Flash Cart <em>(NeoSD rom file also available for download after purchase)</em>. If you have a Neo-Geo CD, you'll find an ISO file that you can use with any Neo-Geo CD emulator <em>(MAME recommended)</em> or burn onto a CD-R to use it with your console.<br/></p>\r\nNeo-Geo CD physical release\r\n<p>If you have a Neo-Geo CD console at home, I'm proud to announce that a beautiful physical release of the game is available from homebrew publisher Cote Gamers:</p>\n\n<p>We did our best to create a physical release whose quality matches the commercial releases of the 90's. And we really hope you'll enjoy this release!</p>\n<p>The Neo-Geo CD physical release is currently on \"pre-order\", and will be shipped in May 2023. The game development itself is complete <em>(as you can see when playing the ROM sold here)</em>, and we are doing some final tweaks on the packaging.<br/></p>\n<p>Last but not least, <strong>if you buy the Neo-Geo CD physical release, you'll also receive the ROM versions for free (CD, AES and MVS)!</strong><br/></p>\r\nHow about a physical release on MVS and AES?\r\n<p>I'll be honest, my dream goal with this project is to <strong>create a an actual physical release of the game on MVS and AES formats too</strong>, with a beautiful manual, cover, box and cartridge. Whenever possible, I try to made to find partners able to build new cartridges to make such physical releases a reality. So I contacted several people able to create new cartridges for MVS and AES. The sad answer is that it's very expensive <em>(around 200\u20ac or $ per cart, excluding box and manual)</em>, and that they require you to buy several dozens of cartridges upfront.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>So before investing such a large amount of money (or partnering with a publisher), I need to have a rough idea of how many people (if any!) would be interested to buy a physical release of Yo-Yo Shuriken on MVS or AES. The final prices would depend on the number of people interested and the supplier used, but I can give you a rough estimate of the \"retail price\" from the quotes I've got so far: <strong>around 250-300\u20ac or $</strong> for the AES and MVS versions.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you'd be interested in a physical release of Yo-Yo Shuriken for Neo-Geo AES or MVS, <strong>please contact me by email</strong> and tell me what format you'd like (MVS and/or AES) and how many copies: <br/></p>\n<p><strong>This is not a pre-order:</strong> it's just a way to tell me you'd be eventually interested in a physical AES or MVS release if it became a reality, knowing that the price range should be around 250-300$ or \u20ac per unit. Then, when (and if) this project  have sufficient players interested to become real,  I'll contact you again :).</p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy the game!<br/><em>Dr. Ludos.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T15:13:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aea/aeab41de90dbcf60a826c41e947d8351.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dr. Ludos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
