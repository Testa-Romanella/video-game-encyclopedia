The actual Mahjong scores directly become your score. Not only Mahjong enthusiasts but also those who are not familiar with Mahjong rules and hands can enjoy it intuitively.<br/><br/>The Mahjong tiles that fall are completely random, and like actual Mahjong, there are only up to four of the same tile. It's not a competitive format, and there's no time limit, so you can take your time and enjoy at your own pace.<br/><br/>The game is over when the screen is filled with tiles. Aim for a high score by clearing the Mahjong tiles!<h3>Keyboard Setting</h3>We have received feedback that the keyboard operation is unclear. We will promptly address this issue here.
