Two lit chunks can be swapped with each other. Some of them are linked together with connectors and can be rotated from a distance. Some have walls that divide the chunk into two parts. Sometimes you're joined by a partner and you have to get through the level together.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour objective is to get everyone to the shrine. Some levels have multiple solutions so how you get there is up to you!\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>W A S D to move</li>\n<li>Q and E to rotate the senders / connectors</li>\n<li>Tab to switch character</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWe're 3 students, 2 of us entering for the first time and 1 who has done it once before.<br/>\r\norcolom: \r\n\tTwitter Programmer <br/>\r\nstroeckx: \r\n\tTwitter Programmer <br/>\r\nsooi: \r\n\tTwitter Art, music <br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b85/b859491af1bd3cb560f5a92909fd83fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Orcolom", "Stroeckx", "sooi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
