I am currently in the process of creating a downloadable build for Mac and PC, as well as a VR compatible build. Thank you.\u00a0</p><p>Terra Incognita is a visual exploration of reality outside of the physical realm, and what it means to myself (the individual) but also in a wider historical context (the collective). My research has been led by themes surrounding Hermeticism (an ancient branch of spiritual philosophy which dates back as early as the first century A.D.). Inspired by my research, Terra Incognita is an immersive digital plane filled with magic and sacred symbols, designed upon concepts of ancient alchemy and magic practices. Explore the lands and find 4 digital Artifacts inspired by Alchemic practice on your journey!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T20:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ad/9ad8c069803e368ffd0b34040b3de027.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["catmeredith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
