If you play the bottom one first you can exit it later on and the camera is fixed :P<br/><br/>Enjoy :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T05:37:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3eee46758fbd443741ecee488fd2187.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rockblade"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
