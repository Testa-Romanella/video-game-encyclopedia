I always told your brother and his freaky friends that the heavy metal music they played would be the death of me, but I never expected it to be the death of THEM. Don\u2019t know what kind of cult stuff made this happen, but since your brother won\u2019t be able to move his own stuff out, you\u2019re gonna have to do it before I pay a guy to toss everything in a dumpster.</em></p>\n<p><em>Also you\u2019re probably gonna need to clean up the place if you want his deposit back. Looks like Nat really trashed the whole place with whatever rituals he was doing in there. Figures that cultists would be inconsiderate tenants, but I mean it\u2019s really\u2026really weird in there. Good luck with that.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>-Nat\u2019s Landlord</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T04:56:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/770/770a4c3504beddc13fec08e303c70532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gsaini"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
