You must\u00a0make it as far as possible through a constantly generating sequence of roads, grass and canals, all while cars collide around you!\u00a0You can, of course, swim through the canals\u00a0because you're a toad. Its a simple recreation of frogger I made using the Playbuffer framework\u00a0for a project but theres lots of fun settings to change the game up in the options menu so I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>P.S theres no clicking in any of the menus you just mouse over buttons, theres no audio for performance reasons\u00a0also the score counters are broken for legal reasons</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T17:32:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e2/9e2ccd433e6cd0c27270c68d4912e5d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Duskaneer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
