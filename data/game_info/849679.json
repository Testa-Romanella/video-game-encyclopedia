I throw this together this weekend. I didn't use any tutorials or guides. I just took my pervious knowledge from previous project and made a rudimentary game. It's a basic game but an application of applying existing knowledge to a new thing. I used existing assets from opengameart.org but the code and everything else is my work. I'm happy with it. I feel like I managed to apply knowledge rather than being guided by a video/teacher (not that there is anything wrong with videos/teachers, just glad to do it on my own for once).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T06:29:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/558/5588c513b1c5557491267258c87ee23a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heroic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
