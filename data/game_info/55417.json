{"id": 55417, "slug": "donk", "name": "Donk!", "name_original": "Donk!", "description": "<p>Donk! Samurai Duck! is a video game featuring a duck named Donk, who was raised by samurai warriors. To prove himself he has set off to collect crystals from 112 levels of earth. Once you collect the target quota of gems, you must escape from each level through one of its many exits, giving the game a similar structure to Alien Breed: Tower Assault. Magical powers can be collected along the way, including the ability to turn into an inflatable toy duck, which makes it possible to float across water. There is a simultaneous split-screen 2-player mode included as well.</p>\n<p>The game was originally going to be released with the title Dong, but the British developers did not want to cause offence as the word can mean \"penis\" in English speaking countries. The name was changed at the last moment to Donk. Some demo versions distributed on Amiga cover disks still bore the name Dong.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:05", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Supervision Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["GOAT Store", "Supervision Entertainment", "The Hidden"], "esrb_rating": null}
