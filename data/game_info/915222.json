Whenever you get bored of one level, just go find another one! No need to pay for DLC maps like the old days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In edit mode, you build custom levels to craft a terrifying experience for other people to survive in. Will you build a large open field, or a tight cave system with undead popping out from every corner? Maybe you'll rebuild a classic from games of the past. Zombies in Peach's Castle? Der Riese from Call of Duty?\u00a0 Don't mind if I do.</p>\n<p>Whatever you make, or if you're just looking for maps, Discord\u00a0is a great place to share levels with each other and have discussions about the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is in an early state and may be unstable or broken.\u00a0 I'll continue working on this game and will eventually move towards a Steam release. Sharing maps will be easy and integrated in-game with Steam's Workshop, and multiplayer is a hopeful goal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm excited for the future of this project and hope to see you around.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T07:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d2/1d2e76c1abb788e005218bed60d74545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HawkSandwich"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
