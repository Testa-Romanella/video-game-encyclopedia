The Dispensing Stations requires a connection to the appropriate Filling Stations in order to give light to each floor. Unfortunately this can\u2019t be done without some help. It is your job as a paint tube to collect the correct color from a Filling Station and deposit it into the Dispensing Station in order to form somewhat of a connection between the two.   </p>\n<p>There are a total of 5 floors ranging from way to easy to \u201cUGH...\u201d This is the first time I\u2019ve joined a game jam and I\u2019m pretty much a novice. Trying to make this on my own while having two full time jobs is rather challenging, but I managed it some how.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy it!</p><p>Edit: I fixed a collision bug while there was 2 days left in the jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T14:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fe/9fe74f91301ae9df58ea0e3f9a773f5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["megowhat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
