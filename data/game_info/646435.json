I would advise using full screen or downloading to windows verison if possiable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for Mini Jam 86 : Sports in 3 days and over 35 hours. Theme was sports so I picked scuba diving which is one of the most interesting sport in my eyes. And when you are diving and the limitation is \"no stop\" I obviously went for sharks that eat you when you stop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T03:30:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/966/966d73d44fec4c488ed800ac1d083186.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["batuEren"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
