Jam Edition", "description": "<p>SuperHeroU! is, in theory, a game about superhero fights. This demo focuses on the technical aspect of turn-based combat rather than the overall story.</p><p>For the purposes of this demo, your character choices are limited to \"Kitty\" and \"Doggo,\" who each have their own set of elemental powers. They also have the \"rainbow\" power of skipping a turn... which doesn't do anything except skip your turn.</p><p>This demo was created by one person over a period of two weeks for My First Game Jam. After MFGJ has finished and SuperHeroU! has its next playable release, this will be edited with a link to the revised version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c1/6c12461eea67a87c702482345d8f84b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aliengeometries"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
