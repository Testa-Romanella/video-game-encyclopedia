They don't anticipate much of a struggle - Mungolans are simple, earthy types without much love for industry. In fact, Mungola's entire defence force consists of a single squadron of fighter planes - the venerable F-27 \"Platypus\".<br/><br/>What possible threat could a few antique aircraft be to the mighty Collosotropolan Battle Fleet...?<br/><br/>To the Mungolan people the venerable F-27 \"Platypus\" is their last best hope for freedom!</p>\n\n<p>Features:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Unlimited Play</li><li>Two-Player Simultaneous Action</li><li>Stunning Claymation Graphics</li><li>Addictive, Exciting Game Play</li><li>Adjustable Difficulty Settings</li><li>Perfect for the Entire Family</li></ul>\n\n<p>This Game Only Use Free or Donate.
