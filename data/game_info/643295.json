Yea, I don't typically do 3 hour jams, but I thought this would be a fun challenge. Hope this prototype is enjoyable!</p>\r\nControls\r\nMovementW, A, S, DLook AroundMouseJump / Climb<br/>SpacebarInteractE\r\nAssets Used\r\n<p>I did use some assets that I had in my Unreal Engine library, either gotten for free or previously purchased.
