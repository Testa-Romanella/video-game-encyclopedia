Keep this well-trafficked station from\u00a0expanding\u00a0outside\u00a0the\u00a0boundaries,\u00a0by\u00a0any means necessary!\u00a0(Nuclear\u00a0weapons welcome.)</p>\n<p><em>Made in 72 hours for GameDevLeague May 2018 Jam and Dreamhack Austin Jam. The themes are \"<strong>Remake a Classic Game</strong>\" and \"<strong>S P A C E</strong>\" respectively. I interpreted this as zero gravity space Tetris. I added a gratuitous nuclear twist to make the game explode.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions: </strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Maneuver the station and the incoming spacecraft to control where they connect. Poorly aligned docking attempts can cause trouble - I'm leaving the occasional glitches as a feature. Use them to your advantage to achieve miraculous maneuvers.</li><li><strong>Connect at least 8 blocks</strong> in a line to evict them and gain points. Gain bonus points when evicting multiple lines at once. The points for 1-4 simultaneous evictions are: 100,\u00a0 300, 500, and 800.</li><li>After every 1000 points earned, a nuclear missile will automatically be fired at the station, in a spiraling path inwards towards the center. Make sure it hits where it counts.</li><li>You lose if the station grows outside of the red lines.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\r\nActionControlRotate Station<br/>Left/Right Arrows or A/D keys<br/>Rotate Incoming Spacecraft<br/>Up/Down Arrows or W/S keysAccelerate Incoming Spacecraft<br/>Hold Space.
