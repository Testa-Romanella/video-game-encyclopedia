You must dive under the water to dodge various obstacles that you encounter to survive and increase your score. People exploring the area may occasionally throw some tasty bread and peas for you to eat but you must fly up out of the water to catch them! There is an oxygen meter which limits the time you can spend diving underwater so you must balance this with flying over obstacles in order to continue diving and surviving!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T16:24:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c4/9c45030c352ca7f2b5cce73f133173e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GBrackpool"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
