Thus when I heard of the limitation my mind eventually found itself with the Touhou 9.5 photo mechanic, which actually does not fit the limitations. However, since photos lock in place facts of life and emotions anyway, I, hopefully correctly, thought this would be a good fit with some major changes. In the end what's left is only the real world context of it, rather than a game mechanic, mostly.\u00a0</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<ul><li>Font: somepx</li><li>Audio samples: www.soundjay.com</li><li>Bannger and other game page art: rubyyogurt</li><li>Programming, game art, SFX: yours truly (me)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T08:58:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/66735fdc4880b6cb4658575c644b50d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StereoMimi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
