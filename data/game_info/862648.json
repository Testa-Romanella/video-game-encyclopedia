{"id": 862648, "slug": "a-multiverse-of-problems", "name": "A Multiverse of Problems", "name_original": "A Multiverse of Problems", "description": "<p>A game where you'll have to apply your imagination to generate the story (because we didn't write one).\r\n</p>\n<p>There are four dimensions -- the bucket dimension, the watcher dimension, the mold dimension, and the boss room. Use the items collected from the locations to defeat the boss.</p>\n<p>The game is in a partially-complete state, but is playable. We had some unexpected time losses and it was probably overambitious to make several minigames. This uses the same homebrew engine which we've used in the past few jams. It hasn't matured in features since LD50, and we've resolved to have an LD51.5 to address some of the shortcomings/pain points to make a better game next time!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to make directional melee attacks (no visual feedback).</p>\n<p>Q and E to cycle inventory slots.</p>\n<p>F to use the selected item if available.</p>\n<p>Spoilers (since we didn't have time to do in-world storytelling):</p>\n<p>- The mold will grow if you dump water adjacent to it. Create a large enough patch to get mold fruits.</p>\n<p>- The fountain doesn't work.</p>\n<p>- The mold fruit gives you a damage buff, use this to make the boss health manageable.</p>\n<p>- The coins are useless, there was supposed to be something useful from the watcher room, but there isn't. Think rich thoughts when you pick the coins up, it might help.</p>\n<p>- Hitting the boss head (the spinning bit) deals double damage. The hitbox isn't properly synced with the animation, though.</p>\n<p>- You win by killing the boss. There's a victory screen that doesn't display because we ran out of time. We're impressed you made it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:41:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/756551fcc9ea99512e7ab0e1f20953da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mdburns"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
