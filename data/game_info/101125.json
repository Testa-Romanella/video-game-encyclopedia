I might just release it with adds with a pay to remove option. Either way the first 3 levels will be free.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>What platforms will you release on?</strong>\n</p><p>Endurance will initially be released on Windows, OSX, and Web. I also have a version running on tablets, but it requires a bit more optimization. (most of the testing has been done on an iPad.)\r\n</p><p>During the open beta I'll just be releasing Windows and Web versions.</p><p>\r\n\tFollow the development progress at IndieDB</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/550/550af35ed99c197ae97ceddac01d27a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["virtualhat"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
