But this often means that some characters will have all their limb cards taken away. In that case, when their Health Point goes to zero, they will simply die. Their sacrifice in exchange for a strategic victory.</p>\n<p><strong>How does our game related to the\u00a0Limitation(Failure is Inevitable)?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>First, our game is a little bit hard.\u00a0We don't expect players to get through the game on the first try. Players will need to experiment with various character card positions and limb card combinations.</p>\n<p>Second, before the start of each level, there will be a mini-game. This mini-game is very SIMPLE, but test the player's reaction speed. Failure is inevitable, and the consequences of failure need to be borne by the players themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Description:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This is a Mini Card Game.\u00a0Players need to help the game development team (us) to defeat Bugs and complete the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Control System</strong>: Mouse Left Click to press the buttons or drug &amp; drop cards.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before the start of each level, players need to attack all the red areas on the bar to ward off the onslaught of stronger bugs. Players need to press the ATTACK button when the arrows overlap the red areas. There are three red areas in total.</p>\n<p>If the player successfully ATTACKED the three red areas, the level is on Normal difficulty. If the player has a miss, the level will have an extra enemy deck (making the game harder). <strong>(Failure is Inevitable)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Each character card has its own initial amount of health point and attack point. On the initial deck, each character has five limb cards. The values of the limb cards are tied to the character cards. Players can move limb cards to different character cards. An unlimited number of limb cards can be placed on a character card.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> When the player removes the limb card from the initial character card, the health point and attack point of the character card are reduced - depending on the value of the limb card. That is, players can figure out the best way to defeat their enemies by managing and calculating the values provided by the limb cards placed on different characters.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Whenever a limb card is disassembled it will reduce the life limit and current Health Point of the character card. If the current Health Point is 0, the character card dies and will never return to player's hand.</p>\n<p>It is always the player who attacks first. If there is an enemy in front of the character card, the character card will attack the enemy in front of it first. If there is no enemy in front of the role card, the role card will attack the enemy randomly. Enemies attack in the same way as the player.</p>\n<p>If you beat a level, you are given a choice: gain a group attribute gain, or a new character card.\u00a0If you lose a level, then unfortunately, you need to start over.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy your time on playing!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Our Team:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Demi Liu:</strong>\u00a0Programmer, Game Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>https://zixingliu.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Connor Zhang:</strong>\u00a0Game Designer, Audio Design, UI Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>https://konnorz0104.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Qihuan Jiang:</strong>\u00a0Balance Designer, Game Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>https://qihuanjiang.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Whitney Zhang:</strong>\u00a0Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/XinyiZhanghdd<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mina Li:</strong>\u00a0Artist\r\n</p><p>https://itch.io/profile/mina-li<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T16:48:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc678f469990dc844460a38db0232389.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Konnorz0104"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
