Use it to attack and kill other creatures or blow it up. Kill all creatures on a level to load the next and see how high a score you can amass before being murdered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Levels have no bounds so you can walk into a void of nothing if you want. Walls do not exist and there's no point to doing so, but, y'know, knock yourself out.</p>\n<p>Every level spawns between 10 to 20 enemies, if you seem to stuck unable to get to next level it's probably because the last creature alive is the one you are currently dominating. Just kill it with Right Mouse/Q/Right Control.</p>\n<p><strong>Author notes:</strong><br/>My first attempt at a game jam, and technically my first ever \"release\" game. It's janky and unfinished and terrible and I am \"mildly\" ashamed of it.<br/></p>\n<p>But ultimately it was also a fun and valuable learning experience.
