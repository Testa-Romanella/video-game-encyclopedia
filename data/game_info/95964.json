Once you've finally lit all four towers, it's a mad dash to escort the heir of the empire to the boat before Atlantis falls.</p><p>Transparency Update: We have made a few minor updates that fixed Hard Crashes / Locks / Soft Locks, they are detailed in the Patch Notes below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ca/1caa496e2333f12f285674722f7f1629.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Occult Softworks"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
