The game is a spin-off of the Mega Man X series of titles. It was first released in Japan on July 29, 2004, with releases in North America and Europe following that September and November.</p>\n<p>Command Mission takes place in the 23rd century, when a metallic substance called \"Force Metal\" is discovered that revolutionizes engineering for \"Reploids\", humanoid androids with human-level intelligence. When an assault on a Force Metal mining island occurs, a \"Maverick Hunter\" team led by Mega Man X is sent out in response. Command Mission differs from previous entries in the series in that it is a turn-based role-playing game (RPG) rather than an action-platform game. Force Metal can be equipped to each playable character to gain special abilities.</p>\n<p>The game was developed by many of the team members who previously worked on Capcom's Breath of Fire series of RPGs. According to the producer of Command Mission, a plot-focused RPG based on the Mega Man X games was created because the series is well known for its action and storyline. Command Mission was met with a mostly average critical response. Reviewers generally praised its battle system, but disagreed about its other aspects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T10:33:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/779/7791c2fae2b389abd8878678ca89c8af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.71, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 11, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Capcom Production Studio 3"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
