Each year they choose 10 girls to do a game all by themself from A to Z : programming, game design, art etc. You have to do it in 6 weeks. I was among the chosens this year.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pixelles is a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering more women to make and change games, founded by Tanya Short and Rebecca Cohen-Palacios based in Montreal, CA. Pixelles organizes free monthly workshops, a mentorship program for aspiring women-in-games, game jams, socials and more.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>It is an island on another planet. There are 3 spirits gathered on a big tree which maintain the life on the island with the energy of the universe. But one day, another spirit, jealous, wanted to take all the energy for himself and let die everybody. He was banished. Angry, with the small amount of energy he took before, he triggered a storm. The three spirits in the big tree was scattered everywhere in the island. The goal is to gather again the spirits' stones to save everybody.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Backstage</strong></p>\n<p>I made the game with Unreal 4 and Maya. I do not know how to code so I use the blueprint system which is so efficient for a person like me. I modeled all the assets with Maya. I had 1 week and a half left to do the art and the game design so I chose to do something cartonnish. I decide to texture the whole world with vertex colors. In Maya, I used the red, green and blue to locate the different colors. In Unreal, I attributed the different colors for RGB in a shader.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gamepad</strong><br/><strong>Y</strong> - Helper<br/><strong>X</strong> - Activate, Collect<br/><strong>A</strong> - Jump<br/><strong>Joysticks</strong> - Navigate in the game</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Y</strong>\u00a0- Helper<br/><strong>X</strong>\u00a0- Activate, Collect<br/><strong>Space</strong>\u00a0- Jump<br/><strong>Directional arrows </strong>or<strong> W, A, S, D</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0Navigate in the game</p>\n<p>Version playable with Xbox gamepad and Keyboard/Mouse</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/356/356eb39f41a26de1424e1c37a339ed32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["angieforever222"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
