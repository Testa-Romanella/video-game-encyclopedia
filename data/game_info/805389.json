{"id": 805389, "slug": "caverns-of-mehillon", "name": "Caverns of Mehillon", "name_original": "Caverns of Mehillon", "description": "<p><strong>In the Caverns of Mehillon, players take on the role of Tamzene, a dryad warrior woman on a quest to explore a complex of caverns full of monsters.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Armed with her trusty sword and a variety of spells, Tamzene must use her agility and combat skills to navigate the treacherous caverns, battling hordes of monsters along the way. With combats in an<strong>\u00a0hybrid action-text interface\u00a0</strong>and secrets to discover, the Caverns of Mehillon offer a <strong>unique\u00a0</strong>and challenging action-fantasy gaming experience. <strong>Every play through is different</strong>, as the monsters encountered are random, as are the events that occur. \r\n</p>\n<p>Every play is different as <strong>most of this game is generated.</strong> You may encounter the same or different monsters on each level, so there is always something new. This game features <strong>pseudo-figurative art\u00a0</strong>that stimulates imagination, and is programmed from scratch in its own game engine in C#. \r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Caverns of Mehillon</strong> is a <strong>casual\u00a0</strong>game but you can <strong>save and load your progress</strong> if you wish to <strong>continue your adventure where you left it.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Players can <strong>create their own characters by adding images and setting stats, changing the name of the heroine if they so choose.\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>There will be free and paid extensions</strong> for this game, like <em><strong>new levels, new adventures, and new heroines.</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p><em>In this moment the game is in development (early access). It's fully playable, although there may be some bug. I say it's in development because I will add more features and extension packages.</em>\n</p>\n<p>I've set a 'pay what you want' price so you can consider it as a donation for the development of the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>All the feedback is welcome, and all suggestions will be considered, for the development of this game. Feel free to message me or comment! :)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Game credits:</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>Soundtrack by Emily https://rollforfantasy.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>Programming and graphics:\r\n</p>\n<p>Jordi R.
