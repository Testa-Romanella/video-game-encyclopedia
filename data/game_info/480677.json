It is BARELY a game, but I'm proud I finally joined one and made something.</p>\n<p>Goal was to have a monster chase you through the halls, using the watch (Or subject 547 as it's called) to avoid detection and discover what was going on. For a first game jam, way way over my head. But I learned an absolute TON from this, and I'm pretty proud of my 2 day project (lost a day due to work :/\u00a0).</p>\n<p>Get in, get the watch, and get to the exit without being spotted, that's your only goal. Use the lockers to hide from cameras, or press space to pause time and analyze your situation, then dashing through time in a specific direction, even through cameras! Just make sure you time it right so you don't accidently dash into one!</p>\n<p>The only enemy is the camera, if it sees you, it's game over and back to the start. Good luck, have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e46e473881995f83f5ca270fdf243213.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xxKobalxx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
