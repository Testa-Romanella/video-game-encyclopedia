Fish produce bubbles, which can be used to upgrade individual fish, level up and customize their tanks and/or buy more beautiful and exotic fish! The number of bubbles each fish produces is dependent on its level, its species, and also its productivity. A fish\u2019s productivity is influenced by its happiness - which can change based on its environment, as well as how well it is cared for. \r\n</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>This project was created by a team of 3rd Year Digital Arts students at the Uni of\u00a0Witwatersrand for their end-of-year exam game for 2021, and was later revised and polished further for the DA Department February 2022 Exhibition (exhibition page).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The team consisted of Jodi Chapson (myself), Dylan Baker and Kamogelo Maimela. For my part in this project, I was the lead artist and was responsible for the overall art direction and majority of the 2d asset creation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>As of the publishing of this game on Itch (dated 18 April 2022), it has several bugs (specifically with the dirty tank feature) and has much room to grow and be improved further. However,\u00a0the game is no longer in development, and may remain in its current form, until the developers decide to pick up the project once more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, any support, feedback and/or critique will be welcomed. It has a long way to go as a game, but I do hope you enjoy the experience. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T21:40:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4e/d4ed02abbf4b49d907eedb1b43748dba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jodi Chapson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
