Command's support of how everything transpired is weak and many of her crew face disciplinary actions for their part in the operation. It all weighs heavily on Major Natalie Puccile, whose investigation led them down that route, but not nearly as much as the knowledge that she was forced to decide between the woman she cared about and her mission. With only a tankard and a collection of games to distract her from her life, Natalie begins to question why she signed up in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>That's when the first ray of hope in the storm of her life begins to shine through. A charming woman, Aria, comes to the suffering major with a dire plea. When taking a prominent researcher to a campsite, her shuttle went down and Aria needs the help of the KSS Nimross to save the lives of those now stranded and scattered on the planet. With a purpose driving her once again, Natalie sends the Nimross out once more to save the lives of the innocent.</p><p>-Direct Sequel to Rising Angels: Reborn<br/></p><p>-Yuri kinetic novel (no choices)</p><p>-5-7 hours of excitement and adventure!<br/></p><p>Sprite/CG artists: Nuge / Elphie<br/> BG artist: lordless</p><p>Writer: Chief Komi</p><p>Music:</p><p>Felipe Adorno Vassao (Red Rose)</p><p>Wiseguy Entertainment (A Candles Light)</p><p>Alexander Khaskin (Driving Dream, Science and Technology 2,3,4, Solaris, Strangeness, Trouble in Paradise, Urgent Information, Written In Blood, and several nameless pieces.)</p><p>Little Bombs (Deal With The Devil; aka the opening song)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dd/5dd42b7b7b7f5a730f9d4014d4c69c56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["IDHAS Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
