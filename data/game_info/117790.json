Besides the tutorial there is something I called \"sandbox area\" which is just the room used for testing stuff where other weapons are unlocked.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind\u00a0 that this is a very early version of a proof of concept and in the future almost everything will be massively different or at least polished.</p>\n<p>And these are my\u00a0twitter and\u00a0tumblr if you want to follow closely the development process.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92b0b665355a29814c5bd8ea0d7ac8a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wabbaboy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
