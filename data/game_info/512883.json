You can collect more lives by collecting the brown mushrooms by hitting the question mark blocks.\u00a0 But, these mushrooms are scanty so you should try to avoid death.</p>\n<p>You can collect\u00a0stars by hitting the question mark blocks\u00a0\u00a0to become invincible. \"Invincible\" means the enemies will not be able to kill you so you can kill them just by hitting them but this powerup will last exactly for ten seconds after which you will resort to normal and the enemies will be able to kill you again.\u00a0\u00a0You can still die if you fall of the platform when in \"Invincible\" mode. Being invincible only prevents enemies from killing you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to Boost The Score:</p>\n<p>You can kill enemies, collect coins, collect powerups and you can even try to finish a level as soon as you can to boost your score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game will end once you reach the princess who is in level 6.</p>\n<p>Fixed Bugs while testing(in early access)</p>\n<p>Only the player should be able to kill the enemies but even the powerups manage to kill it when they jump over it. (Fixed)</p>\n<p>One enemy intersects with other enemy. (Fixed)</p>\n<p>Known Minor Bugs:</p>\n<p>The play game button navigates to the level directly instead of showing \"World 1-1\" and then navigating to the level.</p>\n<p>The first mushroom in the first level behaves a little strange.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Frequently Asked Questions:</p>\n<p>How long did it take you to develop this game?</p>\n<p>It took me about a couple of months to develop this game.
