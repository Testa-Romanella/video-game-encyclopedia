{"id": 111190, "slug": "the-big-blow-up-demo", "name": "The Big Blow Up [Demo]", "name_original": "The Big Blow Up [Demo]", "description": "<p>DESCRIPTION:<br/></p>\n<p>Each player can fire Burst bullets or Balloon bullets. Burst bullets will reduce the enemy's health, and they'll drop gems when they're defeated. Balloon bullets will increase the enemy's size , firepower and defenses - as well as the number and value of the gems they drop when defeated. If you can time your shots properly, the enemy will drop even more valuable rainbow gems. But none of this matters if you can't collect them in time, or another player attempts to steal them. Try experimenting to see what else you can use Burst and Balloon bullets on, and compete for the high score. <br/></p>\n<p>Although the game allows you to play against computer-controlled opponents, it's recommended you play with a friend.<br/></p>\n\n<p>CONTENT:</p>\n<p>This build contains two short levels and two bonus challenges. The <br/>Arcade mode plays through all four levels and allows 1 to 4 <br/>human/computer players; the Versus mode lets you choose a stage and <br/>requires at least 2 players.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE :</p>\n<p>The Summer Jam build has no boss fights, music or sound effects.
