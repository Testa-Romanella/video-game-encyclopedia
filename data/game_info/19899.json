At most levels, different gimmicks will appear as you move forward, and you will need to consult with your peers and think about new ways to cooperate.<br/><br/>This version is essentially a port of the one we released on the Nintendo Switch in 2019.<br/>However, it's not just a port, it now supports online play.<br/><br/>The 2016 version of this link has been renamed  \"PICO PARK:Classic Edition\"<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/<br/><br/>[Flexible Level]<br/>Each level of PICO PARK can be cleared when players get the key,unlock the door and all players reach it.But, every level requires cooperation to complete..<br/><br/>[Battle Mode]<br/>Co-op play is the main work of this game, but let's compete with friends in BATTLE MODE once co-op play is completed.<br/><br/>[Endless Mode]<br/>Even if you complete all 48 stages, you can play ENDLESS mode to aim at high score by collaborating with friends. By collaborating with friends, your score will grow faster.<br/><br/>[Online Play Mode]<br/>You can play together online with people who are far away from you. <br/>However, this is a game where communication is very important, so we recommend using Discord or Zoom to play while talking.<br/><br/>* If you are connecting more than 5 Xbox controllers, please enable \"Xbox Extended Feature Support\" in Controller Settings.<br/>* Sorry , TecoGamePad is not supported.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-17T16:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/7448401d1e853956a4e1b30b256192a3.jpg", "website": "http://picoparkgame.com/en/", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 588, "beaten": 55, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 22, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 53, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 55, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["TECOPARK"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TECOPARK"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
