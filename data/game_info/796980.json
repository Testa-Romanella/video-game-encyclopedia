Usually we tend to get punished by the game when we fail or we die. This one however, does the opposite. Yes, you will still be punished, but with a reward: the more that you die, your super will-power gauge fills up. When the Super Will-Power Gauge is at its peak, you have the option to become invincible for a limited amount of time.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is still on its limited levels, but I hope that you enjoy playing it:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hotfix Update for v1.0.2:</strong></p>\n<p>- The Instructions Panel now pops out on the first level</p>\n<p>- The slope on the first level is improved for playability</p>\n<p>- The super gauge's size in UI was also improved.</p><p>- Sword Animation Bug where the Player keeps facing right instead of left is also fixed</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Special Thanks to:</strong></p>\n<p>GameDev.TV - GameJam Starter\u00a0Pack\u00a0(https://www.gamedev.tv/)</p>\n<p>Analogstudios_ - Tilesets (https://analogstudios.itch.io/jungle-pico-platformer-tileset &amp; https://analogstudios.itch.io/mine-pico-platformer-tileset)</p>\n<p>brullov - Tilesets and UI (https://brullov.itch.io/oak-woods)</p>\n<p>Vaca Roxa - RPG Pack (https://bakudas.itch.io/generic-rpg-pack)</p>\n<p>neocrey - SFX (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/ambient/horror-sound-atmospheres-and...)</p>\n<p>Chris M Audio - SFX (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/fantasy-menu-sfx-57238#publ...)</p>\n<p>VGComposer - SFX (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/action-rpg-music-free-85434#pu...)</p>\n<p>Daryl Betinol - Sprites and Animation\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dented Pixel -\u00a0 Lean Tween (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595#description)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is the Source Project that can be accessed via Github:</strong></p>\n<p>LegacyPrimo/ShadowRunner: Shadow Runner Game for the Gamedev.tv Game Jam 2022 (github.com)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T17:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/421/421bdda6704e1087b9429fd9a9c08663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LegacyPrimo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
