It doesn't get many updates, but at least you can try it before you buy it.<br/><br/>With the full version of Digi \u00dc you can create your own Avatar and Save it to your Photo Gallery.   <br/><br/>The real application has a growing selection of features, clothing, and items that you can customize your Avatar with.  <br/><br/>The interface is very user friendly and easy to manipulate.  I have personally created all of the images and Interface graphics.  <br/><br/>If you have any suggestions please email me, my email address is listed on the Support page linked bellow.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:08:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58be5bcf4b8d494911ce836e5d07ce5a.jpg", "website": "http://www.doubletroublestudio.com/Digi_U.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Double Trouble Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["John LaRouche"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
