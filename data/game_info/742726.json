Collect nearby resources to bolster your defenses against frequent meteor showers and rival space miners!\r\n\r\n\r\nConsume resources for\u00a0stats or use them to upgrade your base!\r\n<p>In this game, every collected resource has a different side-effect. By consuming certain resources you can gear your ship for defense, offense, mining, or any mixture of the three. There are also rarer resources that give you direct upgrades. Some materials can also be deposited into your base for upgrades or to be turned into placeable turrets.\r\n</p>\r\nSurvive for as long as possible.\r\n<p>As the game progresses, the difficulty will slowly increase. Your asteroid will slowly be chipped away by incoming meteors and enemy mining ships. Having a game plan to utilize your resources effectively will be your key to success!\r\n</p>\r\n-Controls-\u00a0\r\n<p>F - Toggle the inventory</p>\n<p>\u00a0Left Click - Consume a resource/Use mining laser\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right Click - Throw a resource/Shoot\u00a0</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause/Unpause\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T08:33:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0b8cb239c750dcdf5e98d4e4d43663b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamSnack"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
