More determined than ever, they are planning once again to get their hands on the famous magic potion. This time, they\u2019ve come with a stupid, evil plan: to invade the Gaul village and fight until one of them manages to grab Getafix\u2019s cauldron. <br/><br/>Hordes of legionaries emerge in succession across the battlefield from the Roman camps surrounding the village: Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum and Compendium. Fortunately, Asterix, Obelix, Dogmatix and all the village\u2019s inhabitants will be nearby to give you a hand in countering the attacks.<br/><br/>Collect the units of potion you need to place the Gauls and obstacles on the field. Each of them has their own skill.
