The game&amp;#39;s frantic action takes place in maze-like, static levels, where a single player dodges enemies while running and climbing to reach and claim stacks of gold. No jumping is allowed. And shooting enemies is forbidden, but you can blast blocks to access lower platforms or trap pursuing enemies. Winding your way through ever-increasing levels of complexity makes for a superior challenge, but now you can choose to play any one of the 150 levels at any time. <br/> <br/>EXCITING NEW FEATURES<br/>Although the gameplay remains true to the original Apple II version, there are plenty of new features to enhance the experience.  You can magnify the screen around the Runner, set the play speed, adjust the coloring of the art and compete for top spot on the worldwide leaderboards.<br/> <br/>\u2022150 puzzling levels \u2013 all unlocked and accessible<br/>\u2022Two game modes \u2013 Expedition and Time Attack<br/>\u2022New magnification effect \u2013 zoom the action around the Runner<br/>\u2022Multiple play speeds \u2013 super slow to superfast action<br/>\u2022Fully adjustable color palettes<br/>\u2022Worldwide leaderboards<br/>\u2022Multiple control schemes<br/>\u2022Illustrated How to Play section<br/> <br/>&amp;quot;When the first Lode Runner came out on the Apple II, the last thing I expected was that the game would be alive and kicking on a platform as advanced as today\u2019s smartphones more than 25 years later. It&amp;#39;s really gratifying to me that so many people are still interested in the game.&amp;quot;<br/> Douglas E. Smith, Original Creator<br/><br/>\u201cIn the early days, there was Lode Runner. I consider it a real puzzle game. That was my favorite for many, many years. It\u2019s such a good combination of dynamic stuff, the finger-work, and real planning and puzzle-solving. Every level was a real puzzle with its own mechanics, its own dynamics, its own kind of solution. At the same time, it was an arcade game to play. This combination was done absolutely right. I can\u2019t imagine any other game with such inventive and unusual design.\u201d<br/>Alexey Pajitnov, Tetris Creator<br/>Interview with Edge Magazine<br/><br/>Tozai Games and Lode Runner are trademarks of Tozai, Inc. registered or protected in the US and other countries.
