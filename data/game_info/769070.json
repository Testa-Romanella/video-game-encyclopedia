This little dragon has not only been dragon-napped, but he can't get out of his shell so he's having to bounce his way to freedom! In this upside down play style you traverse a slime-infested dungeon as the baby dragon, while searching out spikes so you can crack yourself out of your shell and fly free. All the while, the clock ticks down, and the little dragon is tempted to linger as he gathers the scattered treasure of his family's stolen hoard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T11:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/034/034a3719d3b7ef24f6828196ec5ddc1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuzanneWarr"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
