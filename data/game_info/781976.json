The idea of the app was generated from the problems I had with legibility and proofing print work before sending it for mass printing. Designers create different types of print work daily\u00a0and after which send it off to printers which are then sent to the printers.\u00a0To ensure the scalability of their designs and legibility of fonts\u00a0and images, the designer would either have to print a copy themselves to test for these parameters or this would\u00a0be done by the printers. Oftentimes printers would skip this proofing step if the body of the print is too large in size, by just ensuring that the design file\u2019s elements match current industry standards. The\u00a0process\u00a0as a whole is time-consuming, prone to a margin of error which could risk the final print not meeting client expectations and also has a negative environmental impact.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T22:23:00", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tashardie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
