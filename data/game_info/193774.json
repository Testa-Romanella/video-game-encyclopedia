Shooting and avoiding collisions with flying space rocks is just the beginning. The ship can be upgraded to a terrifying instrument of warfare by improving its beam weapon, reactor, engines, sensors, gyros, armor and more. Adding missile bays and point-defense guns is even an option. It may seem odd to arm a mining ship to the teeth, but the galactic fringe is rife with piracy and being infiltrated by trans-dimensional aliens bent on subjugating the galaxy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb43e33321c96a5ee99687cd269bde21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clevername"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
