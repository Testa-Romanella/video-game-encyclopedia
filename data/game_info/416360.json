SOME MECHANICS DON'T FULLY WORK, SO YOU NEED TO BUDGE THEM A BIT.I HIGHLY ADVISE ONLY USING THE 1920x1200 DISPLAY RES. IF YOU GET STUCK WHILE ROTATING STUFF, PRESS \"F\" AND DRAG THE CURSOR OVER THE OBJECT. I really hope you stick through it and experience what I've made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T03:18:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e30647e01af5b37871c1d880eab5882.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boygivingup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
