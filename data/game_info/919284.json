{"id": 919284, "slug": "dynasty-two119", "name": "Dynasty (Two119)", "name_original": "Dynasty (Two119)", "description": "<p>The world is dangerous. Anyone can\u00a0starve, get eaten, lost, outcompeted or outrun\u00a0 - and the answer to all these problems is to evolve! Look down upon your beings like a god and watch them struggle to survive over the generations. Join them yourself and see how long your bloodline survives! Fill the world with deadly predators, or give your creatures free reign in a paradise. The choice is yours!\u00a0</p>\r\nRULES\u00a0(IMPORTANT!):\r\n<p><strong>1. Blue circles are herbivores (plant-eating animals)</strong></p>\n<p>2<strong>. Green circles are food, eaten by herbivores to gain energy. Each food pellet gives a herbivore 1 energy. Herbivores need 3 energy to reproduce.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Red circles are carnivores (meat-eating animals/predators)<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. You can choose the number of herbivores, carnivores and food on the main menu.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5. You can choose whether to be one of the herbivores with the \"Player\" checkbox (ticked by default). If left blank, you go into observer mode. In observer mode, you can take control of a herbivore by clicking on it and leave control by pressing space.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>6. You can include predators in the simulation with the \"Predators\" checkbox (ticked by default).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>8. You can set a seed for a simulation in the main menu. The seed determines the initial conditions of the simulation. If the seed box is left blank, it is chosen randomly.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>7. When in a started sim, you can exit back to the main menu\u00a0by pressing escape.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>8. The two traits of herbivores are speed and size.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SIZE: The larger the herbivore, the farther away it can see, meaning it can find more food if it is larger.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SPEED: Just the speed of movement of the herbivore.</strong></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>As a player or when controlling a herbivore in observer mode, use WASD or arrow keys to move around. When you have enough energy to reproduce, press Shift to reproduce.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>And as a side challenge</strong>: can you find a seed where predator and prey live in balance instead of one dominating the other?<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the 24th Scorespace Game Jam using python and pygame. Although\u00a0I couldn't submit it on time. I finished the project anyways.
