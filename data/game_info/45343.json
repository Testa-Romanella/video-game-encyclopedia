Your skills will be put to the test as you blast, punch, and stomp your way through this gore infused gauntlet as you tear your foes limb from limb.<br/><br/>In <strong>TENET</strong> your goal is to survive waves of enemies increasing over time in difficulty. Every series of waves end with a Boss Encounter, surviving the encounter enables you to meet the \"<strong>Underworld Seer</strong>\" to summon the <strong>\"Pillar of Vis\"</strong> which grants access to a powerful weapon upgrade or exchange to convert the current sessions collected \"<strong>Runes</strong>\" into \"<strong>Purified Tokens</strong>\" for purchasing higher quality upgrades and cosmetics in the \"Player Profile\". <br/><br/><strong>Please note that the game is currently in Early Access</strong> which means this is not the final state of the game.
