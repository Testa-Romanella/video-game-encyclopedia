Be prepared for vast, unique levels with challenging boss battles!<br/><br/>MANOS is an homage to the great games you remember from your childhood! Remember how every film and cartoon had it&amp;#39;s own platform game adaptation? When every man, woman, child, animal and inanimate object were out to get your character? When the streets were filled with bats, ghosts and Frankenstein monsters? MANOS will take you back to the fantastically absurd games of the past!<br/><br/>Lost on their vacation, Mike and his family have wandered the desert trying to find a place to stay, only to wind up in the haunted Valley Lodge. Maintained by Torgo, an unusual man/satyr who &amp;quot;takes care of the place while The Master is away&amp;quot;, the hotel is swimming with paranormal activity which Mike has to brave through to find his now missing family. Who is The Master, and what does he want with Mike&amp;#39;s family? Armed with his trusty revolver, Mike will have to wander the haunted halls, venture out into the desert, uncover a dark temple and battle the forces of darkness to find out!<br/><br/> - Huge levels with boss battles at the end of each!<br/> - True classic gameplay!<br/> - 100% authentic retro style!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/539/539edf32759c65666a0acc5624688d07.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["FreakZone"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["S J Beddoes"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
