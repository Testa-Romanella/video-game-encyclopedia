I hope, of art.<br/><br/><br/>The Game We All Have To Play is a challenging minimalistic action game. It will take you about 15 minutes to reach the end, but if you want to get an excellent result, you will probably fail again, and again. And each run will feel different due to the abundance of commentaries in poetry form. <br/><br/>Have you ever had a feeling that there is too much on your plate? Some of us even wish there were more than 24 hours in a day. What is more important to you - your career, your hobby, your family? You can always sacrifice one of those things to have more time for another. Or you can try and keep everything under control. But it won't be easy!<br/><br/>In this game you can go the long way from being a newborn to the adulthood in a matter of a few minutes. You will have to make choices along the way. And it will get quite hardcore by the end when you might feel all fingers and thumbs. But if you succeed you will reveal the true name of this game, which is so obvious to see and so hard to grasp.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T15:21:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f7/1f79a69445150e972a735e31077c0f44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zubko"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zubko"], "esrb_rating": null}
