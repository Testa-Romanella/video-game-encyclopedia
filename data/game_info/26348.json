This collection of games was \n      available on portable LCD devices, and each title featured a game and a \n      clock. Each Game &amp; Watch title features two modes of play: GAME A \n      (normal difficulty) and GAME B (more advanced play). While some controls \n      have been changed in the DSiWare version to better suit the Nintendo DSi \n      system, the appearance of the game itself has not been altered.\n    </p><p>\n      Move quickly and use your manhole cover to prevent the pedestrians from \n      falling through the holes! Pedestrians appear from the left on the upper \n      path and from the right on the bottom path. Earn one point every time a \n      pedestrian walks safely over a covered manhole, or receive a mistake \n      icon for every pedestrian who falls down an uncovered manhole. Receive \n      three mistake icons, and it\u2019s game over!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ea/1ea8bd1fea8d274d66323575e587bba8.jpg", "website": "http://www.nintendo.com/sites/dsiware/gameandwatch/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
