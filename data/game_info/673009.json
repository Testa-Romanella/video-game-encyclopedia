In the end, however, it turned out that I participated alone. I myself who have no feeling for graphics, music and during programming I only write mistakes. In the end, however, I managed to make a simple game and even managed to submit it to the Compo variant. But I wish my whole team could be at the next LD.</p>\n<p>It may be interesting that in the whole game you will not find any 3D object other than a cube.</p>\n<p>** About the game:**\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is about collecting as many points as possible in an environment that is obviously unstable. It doesn't make deeper sense, but I can think of several features that would move the game to a completely different level. But 48 hours is not enough for these features.</p>\n<p>** Background music: **\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It feels good to be alive too\" -\u00a0Loyalty Freak Music</p>\n<p>https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p>** Controlls:**\u00a0</p>\n<p>- mouse in the menu</p>\n<p>- Arrows to move</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6c/f6c12c2a85f9ce086913d1ded78c2e54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["quietmuffin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
