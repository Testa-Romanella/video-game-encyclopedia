You win the game by defeating the Frog Queen.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the sokpop gamejam! I wanted to make a game that was inspired by Toverblade. Eventually I added so many random stuff it wasn't like Toverblade at all anymore. I still think it fits the bootleg vibes!</p>\n<br/>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>After clicking new game you arrive at the main screen.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here you have your army of gnomes</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is just a visualization of the gnomes in your army!</p>\n<p>The icons underneath each gnome represent: HP, Defence and Attack power.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>A gnome store to buy more gnomes</strong></p>\n\n<p>Be sure to upgrade your army as you play!\u00a0<br/>Not upgrading it means you will lose the game!</p>\n\n<p><strong>And the enemy selection</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first two enemies are kinda easy but they will get harder and harder.\u00a0<br/>As a player you can select the enemy you want to battle and sometimes it might be smart to battle the same enemy for more money!</p>\n\r\nIn battle\r\n\n<p>When clicking Start level you will start batteling the frog you chose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Select the gnomes you want in this battle! Be careful <strong>gnomes that die in battle are dead and won't come back!</strong></p>\n<p>You will also see some mushrooms in game, you can hide behind them and many attacks won't hit!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Click battle to start the battle.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Click hold and drag on gnomes to the arrows and let go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This will create a conga line to attack the frogs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If your energy runs out\u00a0(upper right corner) it's the frogs turn!</p>\n\n<p>That's all hope I made it clear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are going to be a bunch of updates in the future; like armor/swords/upgrades/more gnomes/status effects!</p>\n<p>If you like what i'm doing follow me here or on\u00a0twitter\u00a0(or\u00a0dev twitter) or on tiktok\u00a0@studioSchmudio!</p>\n\n<p>Have fun playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T09:01:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/482/4820e4d034e4b6eb4e03dcde1d6e7b7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Studio Schmudio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
