This is important! To do this; find potential passengers - they will attempt to hail you by waving their arms in a dramatic fashion. When loaded, drop them off at LUNAR STATION THETA and your company account will be credited based on your odometer reading for that trip!</p><p>Straying outside of the operation area will trigger the Lander's anti-theft system! STEALING ON THE JOB IS NO JOKE AND A BIG PROBLEM. You will receive a text readout warning. Your second warning will come in the form of all interior oxygen being vented into space. This has the unfortunate side effect of agitating the \"K-Stoff\" hypergolic fuel and may result in further problems.</p><p>Contact email: 2800cc@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/180/180aa66e86800de8fb795b65f1c2cccc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Tatrakrad"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
