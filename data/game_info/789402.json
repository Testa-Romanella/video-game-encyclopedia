The basic mechanics of \"Asteroids\" were taken over and expanded to a PvP game. However, the focus is not on the player themself, but on the base that has to be protected. Not only the enemy player, but also the floating asteroids can damage the base. There are also items hidden in the asteroids. The items are supposed to make it easier to protect your own base or to destroy the enemy base.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Attention: To play the game, you need to connect two controllers to your computer</strong><br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Idea / Concept / Art: @eatmyson - https://twitter.com/eatmyson</p>\n<p>Idea / Concept / Programing: @lexonid - https://lexonid.itch.io/</p>\n<p><em>This game was created as a student team project in 2021.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T21:39:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/549f825627efdfc1a345693d385c6397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lexonid"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
