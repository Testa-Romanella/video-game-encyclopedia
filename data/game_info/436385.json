We decided to join this jam using PlayCanvas to learn more about it and its workflow. We can say we succeeded in that! :D</p>\n<p>As with all game jams, we were unable to finish what we wanted but we got 5 levels done with one main mechanic, the magnet. <br/>We plan on working on this project more and experiment with new movement mechanics and extra features, as well as enemy types and power-ups to make the game more interesting.</p>\n<p>We hope you'll enjoy playing it so far :)</p>\n<p><strong>WASD/Arrow Keys:</strong> Move<br/><strong>Escape: </strong>Restart level<br/><strong>Mouse: </strong>Rotate/zoom<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Background music: Black Heat - Ross Bugden<br/>Finish sound: https://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/368512/<br/>Enemy Death sound: https://freesound.org/people/scorpion67890/sounds/396806/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T02:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26b/26bcb7eb06ccf067f13547d753d372a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ivolutio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
