The HD edition adds to the game better graphics and new animations, weapons and secrets.<br />\nSet in the world of aliens and time travel, the story directly continues the plot of The First Encounter: Sam flies to Sirius, but his starship crashes and lands into Central America in the Mayan age. Here he needs to make his way back to Earth through hordes of monsters.\u00a0<br />\nYou can choose from a variety of weapons, from different guns to chainsaws and flamethrowers. As a rule, there are dozens of enemies on screen at the same time while your health and armor are non-regenerative. So, you need to think about your tactics to avoid the strongest attacks. For those who prefer silent kills from a distance, the game features a sniper rifle.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2010-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T13:43:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46a/46ac84997152eaf4f760257a60099231.jpg", "website": "http://www.serioussamhd.com", "rating": 3.89, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 110, "owned": 2802, "beaten": 324, "toplay": 23, "dropped": 82, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 82, "ratings_count": 395, "suggestions_count": 624, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 395, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Croteam"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital", "Majesco Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
