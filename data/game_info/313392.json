Understandably this isn't the best way to make a game, and animations are goofy because of CSS animations, but it was a great learning exercise for all those involved. :)<br/></p>\n<p>Using a random game concept generator, our team got the following concept:</p>\r\n\r\n\"An action game where you beat up clowns just because.\"\r\n<p>Use `ctrl + +` or `ctrl + -` to change the zoom on the game. Alternatively, change the zoom of the browser with `ctrl + scrollwheel`<br/><br/></p>\n<p>If the enemies do not load, refresh the page!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T05:39:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e6830538de4d89a2880e4c8fa67aadf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["I3uckwheat", "bycdiaz"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
