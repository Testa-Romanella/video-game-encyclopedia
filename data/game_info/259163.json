My Game is only made for the Tertary Theme<em>\u00a0 Pong</em> and the Constraint<em> Max two buttons control</em>.</p>\n<p>But now to the Game:</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to get the black ball to the green circle. You can achieve that by moving the black board. \u00a0You move it with the left joystick. With ,,a\" you can change the angle of the board. So if you have been moving vertically, you move then horizontally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With ,,y\" you can restart an level</p>\n<p>If you get the black ball to the green circle you\u00b4re moving to the next level.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT:</p>\n<p>THE FIRST ,,LEVEL\" DOESNT HAVE ANY OBJECTIVE. It\u00b4s only for figuring out the controlls of the black board. If you\u00b4re confident with them, YOU CAN START THE REAL LEVELS WITH PRESSING ,,START\" ON THE CONTROLLER. YOU FINISHED EVERY LEVEL IF YOU RECEIVE JUST AN BLACK SCREEN. <br/></p>\n<p>The challenges are getting harder with obstacles in the level. The Levels are designed that you normally should figure out on your own what every obstacle does. <br/></p>\n<p>But if not here is every obstacle listed, if you don\u00b4t understand one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Level 1: Blue Blocks: Wand</p>\n<p>Level 2: Red Blocks: Level will restart if the black ball or the black board will hit these blocks</p>\n<p>Level 4: Orange Circle: Will turn into the normal green one after an time</p>\n<p>Level 5: Purple Ball(s): Level will restart if the black ball will hit the ball. The purple ball will be destroyed if it will touch the red Blocks</p>\n<p>Level 8: Purple ,,thing\" (Don\u00b4t actually know how to describe this one): Shot\u00b4s purple balls.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce493df5dc8752d11a99e991afa0b169.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eric Neu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
