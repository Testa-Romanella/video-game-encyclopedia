Gameplay focuses on trying to make ends meet and progress in the weird world of professional wrestling while keeping yourself healthy and making enough money to live on.<br/></p>\r\nThe Story\r\n<p>You are a brand-new pro wrestler in a world with a territorial system, meaning a system of geographic regions each controlled by a single booking office. You've got a couple bucks in the bank, and you wrestle every single day for your job. In between throwing your head at the ground for a living, you live like someone who travels every day of their life might- a lot of booze, some drugs if you want, personality clashes, random events, gym workouts, and a lot of being told what to do.</p>\r\nHow Much Does\u00a0It Cost?\r\n<p><strong>Rassler is pay-what-you-can (PWYC)</strong>. If you can support development, pay for the game here on itch. If you pay $3.00+ you'll\u00a0get a cool exclusive magnet featuring one of the wrestlers from the game.\u00a0</p>\r\nI Have Suggestions!\r\n<p>Even if you don't pay, the Rassler Community is open to you and I'd be glad to have your feedback.</p>\n<p>Release Notes are available in the devlog.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/343/343479f99c410e20348ee400c69a2e34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Phil Nelson"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
