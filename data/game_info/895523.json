It is important to me because it talks about my life as a college student and I think my game is significant because every single college student should be able to relate to this game and have fun with it. The game would also encourage people (like me cough cough) that no matter how good or bad your day is, life can always get better!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T14:41:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb075ee293cadbb633ef7d3706f9ff75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cindytran211"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
