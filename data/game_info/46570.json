Imagine flying in that space, going higher and lower, left and right and fly wherever you want to fly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHelium Skies is a casual indie game where the player controls a small airplane with a goal to collect all the helium molecules in every level. The airplane can go in basic directions, but the part that is most fun is doing trick in the sky - loops, barrel rows and whatever you can think of! Collect all the molecules to pass all levels and finish the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d3/5d38ad1d4f3c984883a603105cbe3e71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Netfork Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
