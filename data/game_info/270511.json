Using L-Systems to procedurally generate the tree's means you have total control over their shape and look.</p>\n<p><em>The game features two modes:</em></p>\n<p><strong>Hacking:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Tree's and Gardens are edited using a command line. Saving and loading, tree's and gardens on to floppies. This version offers more of a challenge, and allows for more mistakes and happy co-incidences in the creation of your terrariums. The folder found in game contains an instruction manual as to how to use the computer.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Simple:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Tree's and Gardens are edited using an inbuilt UI that allows for easy control of all aspects of these things. Click on the pot to edit a tree, or on a corner of a garden to edit a garden.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD and mouse controls<br/>Pick up tree: Mouse over a tree and hold left click<br/>Delete a tree: Mouse over a tree and right click</p>\n<p><strong><em>L-system rules:</em></strong></p>\n<p>When programming and building L-systems, these symbols and letters are used to denote particular actions.</p>\n<p>&gt; - used to denote one symbol become another in each generation, so in the case of x&gt;a this means in each generation x will be replaced with a</p>\n<p>a - used to denote a step forward. When the tree is made this will make a peice of tree.</p>\n<p>e - denotes a step forward in the same way as a but ends in a leaf.</p>\n<p>[ and ] - denote a branch. [ will start a new branch from the current one and ] will return to the branch split from when it encountered the [ symbol. [] brackets should always come in pairs.</p>\n<p>+ - denotes a rotation in a random positive direction by 25 degrees.</p>\n<p>- - denotes a rotation in a random negative direction by 25 degrees</p>\n<p>y - denotes a rotation around the Y axis by 20-45 degrees</p>\n<p>c - denotes a rotation around the X axis by 10-25 degrees</p>\n<p>b - denotes a rotation around the X axis by -10-25 degrees</p>\n<p>, - denotes a probabalistic outcome. This is used in rules to create probabilistic outcomes. This is writen in the form a&gt;x,a,aa. Each of these (x, a, and aa) will have a 1/3 chance of being what a is replaced with in each generation.</p>\n<p>Tree game is still in development, with fixes and additional functions to (hopefully) come; if you find a bug, something breaks or there's something you want to see added, please say so!!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/498/498bc330768a7aa372b8a57aeb780ea1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Max"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
