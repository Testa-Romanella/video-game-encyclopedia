{"id": 543240, "slug": "realm-of-order", "name": "Realm of Order", "name_original": "Realm of Order", "description": "<p>Realm of Order, is an entropically stable, multiplayer city building game. Starting in a procedural world, in ancient times, build cities to expand your culture! Each citizen has unique needs that you need to meet in order to progress in the game. Use religion to shape the citizens to your will, or occupy the cities of your peers so they comply with your orders!</p>\n<p>Designed as a large-scale drop-in drop-out session, where progress is made by developing a robust resource network.</p>\n<p>I'm a big fan of city-building games and I've always wanted to play them with friends, however, practically every city-builder that is released is singleplayer. That's why I'm designing one with multiplayer in mind and at the same time bringing original ideas to the genre.</p>\n<p>The core engine is implemented (including multiplayer) and we have the assets, what's left to develop is the UI &amp; gameplay that we have designed.<br/></p>\n<p>However, there's just the two of us working on the game and neither of us have any marketing experience or connections to promote the game. We are thinking of starting a Kickstarter or Patreon to fund the remaining development time however, I want to find out if there is a community for this kind of game.</p>\n<p>So please let me know if you think this game should exist and whether or not you would consider funding the game on Patreon or Kickstarter.</p>\n<p>Don't hesitate to ask any questions!</p>\n<p>You will find our social media links on the (bare-bones) landing-page.</p>\n<p>https://realmoforder.co</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:27:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c01a36f1285af763f404aad88dc5ef8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Splizard"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
