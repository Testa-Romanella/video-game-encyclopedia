The aim of the game is to choose an initial state and observe how it evolves. Different sizes for the map and trully infinite posibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are four rules that determine the movements:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.<br/>\r\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br/>\r\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.<br/>\r\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat to expect:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Simulation of one of the most simple and amazing games ever created.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Original soundtrack during gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Different sizes with up to 10000 cells.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Easy interface and easy to understand gameplay.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d9399c5f4b0a504d15218e467acddbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 27, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Dexion Games", "Spencer Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dexion Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
