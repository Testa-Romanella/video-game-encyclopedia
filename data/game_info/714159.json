Space Trade Sim", "description": "<p>The planets of X1-J6:</p>\n<ul><li>When entering the sector the first planet visitors will encounter is Trader's Rest, a planet devoid of life and any resources of value. Its location and multiple space stations (some operating legally, some not so much) make it a final point where traders can stop to refuel, get the latest news, grab a cup of space decaf, and use the restroom before making the long trip out of sector. Due to its location, lack of notable resources, and miserable climate it has become the prime place for ships to dump unwanted goods, junk, annoying passengers, and mildly radioactive engine waste.</li><li>Planet 19B is the sector's bread basket, a mostly water world with scattered islands. 19B has a major aquatics agriculture industry that easily supplies the rest of the sector's planets with sustenance.</li><li>Xeres is an oxygen and mineral rich planet that provides raw building materials for the rest of the sector. With much of the actual mining done by robots it's surprising to note that there have only been 3 robot uprisings in this planets history.</li><li>Massive machines built on planet Marcellus 4223 help mining operations on Xeres and farming operations on 19B. With Marcellus 4223 featuring low gravity, mostly flat surface, and few valuable resources, it became the ideal place to construct massive factories.</li><li>Planet CW-40 is an ideal planet for several intelligent species from across the galaxy that now call it home. To maintain the natural planet's beauty and help generate wealth the planet's inhabitants have developed a focus on crafting fine goods and high tech gadgets from low profile factories that blend into the local landscape as much as possible.</li></ul>\n<p>Note: There is no save function, once you close the game you must restart! It takes me around 15 minutes to pay off the loan completely. Let me know how long it takes you in the comments!<br/></p>\n<p>My first game, inspired by games like Starship Tycoon and Patrician 3. I initially planned to make this game in a month, 7 months later it was ready for release. My goal was to quickly release my first game, with the constraints of having only 5 tradable resources and minimizing features to help reduce development time. The tradable resources were generalized based on my experiences with other trade tycoon games, so I picked Supplies, Materials, Industrial, Luxury, and Exotic. This also helped me pick a title for the game with the resource's acronym.<br/></p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments your thoughts or if you find any issues while playing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a583ba8dbf7121d718eb38d14384addd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OrangeKilroy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
