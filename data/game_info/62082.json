There are a few options here:<br/><ul><li>For the best experience, we strongly recommend the InterLink-X\u2122. RealFlight is designed for it, and your controls will all be exactly where they should be.<br/></li><li>You can use your RC Radio with an interface. The RealFlight Wired Interface works well for this, and there are 3rd-party wireless interfaces available. This option will require more setup on your part.<br/></li><li>You can use any 4-axis game controller. A gamepad will work, or an advanced flight stick. Your experience will not be as good as using a purpose-built RC radio, though.</li></ul>See the Announcements and Community Discussion for purchase links.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/254/254057a56f4bd2d1ccac6576d89cfb0a.jpg", "website": "https://www.realflight.com/products/rf8/gpmz4550.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Knife Edge Software"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Horizon Hobby"], "esrb_rating": null}
