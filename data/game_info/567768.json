Even though it may seem like a simple and innocent game, it serves as an educational game that encourages players to practice typing in a fun way. As our world becomes more and more technologically advanced, being \u201ctech-savvy\u201d is becoming of greater importance to our daily lives. The keyboard plays a major role as it is one of the most fundamental input tools that allows you to type/input symbols (such as letters, numbers, and punctuation); perform mechanical controls (such as being able to return, tab, or shift); and being able to do additional functions (such as F1-F12 control, escape, and delete). With more of us progressing toward a greater reliance on computers and digital devices, being keyboard adept is favored, and hopefully, this game may help develop better typing skills in an amusing way.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T10:54:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f1/2f118a79c436e5f0d322dd7aefcb895b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alventia"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
