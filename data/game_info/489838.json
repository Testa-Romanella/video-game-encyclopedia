GFlops are needed to construct buildings. The more GFlops you can generate the faster buildings will be constructed. You also need silicon for construction. Build silicon refineries for that.</p>\n<p>Each successive wave will feature more and tougher enemies, so be wise how you spend your mined silicon!<br/></p><p><strong>*This game is in very early development*</strong></p>\n<p>Please leave a comment if you have problems running it.
