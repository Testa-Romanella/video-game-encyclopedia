No time limits, no bad guys, no puzzles. Simple outdoor exploration. The point of the game is to just get lost in the different environments. If just walking around doesn't do it for you each environment has multiple hidden things to find. This game is currently very early in development and will be improved upon and added too as time goes on. This started out as a joke project but turned into a jumping off point to practice making environments and limited interactivity for therapeutic VR simulations I want to make to help people like myself who suffer from environmental based mental illnesses like agoraphobia. It's very basic and simple, think of it as a joke or relaxation aid if nothing else. All money made off Go Outside Simulator will be used to help the production of therapeutic simulations.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you want to explore different environments and look for hidden secrets, or simply play something to calm yourself down and just exists without goals, deadlines, or threats, Go Outside Simulator is for you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/911/911611f850215e88b465d727e62ba97b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron DeVries"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SimRed"], "esrb_rating": null}
