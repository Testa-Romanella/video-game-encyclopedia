Here, have a UV flashlight to spot 'em, and\u00a0special revolver\u00a0to neutralize 'em. How? When you spot an insect, pick a bullet with the most contrasting color and shoot it.\u00a0Y'know, jus' choose the\u00a0opposite color from the color wheel.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The more contrasting the color the more damage it deals.\u00a0Shooting the\u00a0insect with a bullet of the\u00a0same color\u00a0will heal it!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Be careful, those insects are quite dangerous. Let 'em bite you three times, and I'll have to look for another\u00a0sheriff.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Click <strong>A or D</strong> to change color of the bullet.<br/>Move cursor to aim, press left mouse button to shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>AUDIO</strong></p>\n<p>Background music - Caffeine Creek Band from Pixabay<br/>SFX under CC0 licence from Freesound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T03:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/5099f0bd6b524957ae9bf6f8915fd7c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ProstoLyubo", "Xiclu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
