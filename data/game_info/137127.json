It's been a big project getting all the mechanics to work. The timing doesn't quite match the original and certain levels needed to be be adapted to suit. Which certainly isn't a bad thing. I believe it makes this remake unique and a new challenge. I hope you enjoy this release which boasts 75 fun and challenging levels. Can you save all the Piggies? </p><p>Made with Clickteam Fusion 2.5, (special thanks to Schrodinger for help with the Piggy AI).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/794/79437e32658aa22e788b5166b0ddff5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aenever"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
