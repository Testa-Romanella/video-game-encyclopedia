Her emotions are null for her heart is as numb as the icy air outside of her bedroom! Her life was forever altered in a moment of weakness and rather than face the music, she is running away. Her endeavors were withered away in seconds. All those years of studying at an Ivy League school and her passion for books were wasted on a nugatory choice that could\u2019ve been prevented. To Michaela, what is the point of going back if she\u2019s not allowed to repent? \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done,\u201d she cursed to herself as she lay to rest in a mansion infested with paranormal activity and a lone boy hiding in the halls. She woke up to find that the danger she created followed her. The past has a way of sticking to someone like glue that can leave a rash once ripped off the flesh. Regret may be out of reach for Michaela, but saving this child could help her learn from what she had become and it may be the first painful step toward finding a new reason to live.</p><p>The following music was used for this media project:</p>\n<p>Music: Creepy Piano Ambience by Tim Kulig</p>\n<p>Free download: https://filmmusic.io/song/8725-creepy-piano-ambience</p>\n<p>License (CC BY 4.0): https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Artist website: https://timkulig.com/albums</p><p>Music: Ambient Suspenseful Calm by MusicLFiles</p>\n<p>Free download: https://filmmusic.io/song/8563-ambient-suspenseful-calm</p>\n<p>License (CC BY 4.0): https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Artist website: https://cemmusicproject.wixsite.com/musiclibraryfiles</p><p>Music: Mechanical Toy Boss by Mikael Hellman</p>\n<p>Free download: https://filmmusic.io/song/5213-mechanical-toy-boss</p>\n<p>License (CC BY 4.0): https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Artist website: https://filmmusic.io/artists/mikael-hellman</p><p>Music: Vetur Frosti by Alexander Nakarada</p>\n<p>Free download: https://filmmusic.io/song/4771-vetur-frosti</p>\n<p>License (CC BY 4.0): https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T18:53:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca7/ca77a33b70623cb8f7c739461b23a2a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Westley Nelson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
