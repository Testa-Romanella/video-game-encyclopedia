There may have been many game jams before this, but today is our virgin voyage!<br/></p>\n<p>Take command of a dread pirate's ship and collect as much booty as ye can!

But it doesn't stop there, stockpiling munitions and having too many crew members will also dampen your abilities. Maybe you can afford to jettison some of those crew members... Can you get the high score (in play testing ours was 18!) and become a famous buccaneer? Or will you sleep with the fishes...
