You overslept and missed your ride back to the North Pole. Now your only hope is to get to the mall and catch a ride with Santa. Unfortunately, you are almost out of Christmas magic, so you won't be able to stay invisible long enough to get to the mall. You notice everyone is wearing ugly Christmas sweaters. Who would notice an extra elf in a sweater, right? It is time to get sweater hopping to the mall!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt would be a great plan if only the ugly Christmas sweaters weren't so dangerous. Each sweater contains a retro style mini game. Beat the game and you get more magic to keep on sweater hopping. Lose the game and you'll be booted back to the street with less magic than before.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Ugly Christmas Sweater Game features 18 retro-styled mini games to challenge your skills and tickle your funny bone. Master each challenge to become a sweater hopping champion!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T04:15:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1f/b1ffeb71c6841fd796e22944ad1b4446.jpg", "website": "http://classegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Denki Gaka", "classEgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Denki Gaka"], "esrb_rating": null}
