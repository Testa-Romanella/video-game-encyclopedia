I hated my life when\u00a0I was at this job, but because of stupid decisions I\u00a0made for some reason I stayed at it for 6 years, until one day I just quit, since that day my life has been amazing.<br/><br/>Thankfully I made it out and now I'm able to make video games and laugh at it. My goal was\u00a0to make a game that was similar to art styles of the 90s arcade games like Pit Fighter, Lethal Enforcers, Narc etc... and as I'm still learning I didn't want to focus too much on artwork so\u00a0I though this style would work great.<br/><br/>There was more I wanted to do with this... like my boss shooting cheese out of a cannon a few more stages, but I was just working on this waay to long and ran out of time, I tend to work on things and never finish them, so 100% was going to finish this.<br/><br/>Had fun making it, was laughing the whole time, shared it with a buddy who also quit :P The cell phone was almost the one I had back then, and those are text I would get at all hours of the day and night... :P Maybe this project was more a games as therapy session... lol<br/><br/>But just a quick throw away project,\u00a0I really love the 90's art like this,\u00a0I think\u00a0I might do something more elaborate at some point with it, but I felt like I was at a good stopping point with this one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T04:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d65/d65267743c124facf0a8678ecf556b3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["PixelPun | GamesbyRob"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
