Use the rake to pile the leaves up, then press X to switch to gloves. With the gloves, you can pick up the leaves and dump them into the compost bin. The more leaves deposited, the bigger the explosion! Its fun to leave it running for a bit so you can grab a big pile of leaves all at once! <br/></p>\n<p>Made with Pico-8 for #CozyAutumnGameJam2022<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T08:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d5ef8fd2b7d562da8e0071f111b5dac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["drspaceman0"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
