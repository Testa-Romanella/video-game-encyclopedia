There are also a few technical issues with the UI which i just ran out of time to fix and was not able to correctly align the anchor points for the full screen build.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoy the challenge of the platforming in the game and as a heads up it is possible to become stuck in a loop of the same 2 levels........ this is an intentional feature and was included to be inline with the theme of that wasnt supposed to happen. I dont want to give away too much but theres also a secret button that is defiantly not supposed to appear either hahahah\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>*resources -</p>\n<p>buildings 3d model assets - Quaternius (ultimate building pack)</p>\n<p>UI typewriter effect - Mika (unity coder)</p>\n<p>low poly soldier demo -\u00a0Polygon Blacksmith</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T06:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbc/fbcc653a9e914c772a00ca2032ed1a8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dnewman1912"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
