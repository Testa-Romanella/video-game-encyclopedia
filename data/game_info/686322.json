Captured by the enemy, he must beat, blast and shoot is way through the hordes to finally claim victory in the war against the scourge.\u00a0</p><p>But none of that really matters in this demo! At the end of the day, you have a gun and everything else as very squishy and goopy innards, so you already know exactly what you're getting into. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T10:36:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c337acda7f3337596b3953e91b7fc57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LukeWilliams79"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
