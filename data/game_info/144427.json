You have inherited the keys to a dungeon. This won\u2019t end well.</p>\n<p>The birthday dungeon\u00a0combines the sensibilities of\u00a0lovecraftian horror with the strategy of the rougelike genre and the thrills of a reading comprehension test. It is a fast-paced text-based roguelike riddled with mystery and intrigue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is easy to learn (you click on things and try not to die) but hard to master (you need to click on the right things to not die.) You will fail. Repeatedly. However, each attempt will help you learn develop new strategies for survival.</p>\n<p>The Birthday Dungeon would make a great birthday present for somebody you don't like very much. It would also make a great Christmas present for anybody whose birthday happens to fall on Christmas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an early access title. Further expansions to the dungeon are underway, bugs are being squished, polish is being applied.
