He had been asking me to develop it since I began developing the game... so I did it for a special occasion!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This was also my first 3D game (with help by a fellow developer, Goest, with proficiency in 3D modelling!).</strong></p>\n<p>In <strong>Mr Tubby</strong>, you must fend off the menacing rubber ducks with all your power... and a water pistol. As you get more and more efficient at popping those ducks, you will earn yourself more outfits for them!</p>\n<p><strong>UNLOCK</strong></p>\n<p>Unlock up to 8 different outfits/styles for your ducky foes! Satisfy your eyeballs with beautiful (and very hot) rubber ducks.</p>\n<p><strong>DEFEND</strong></p>\n<p>Mr. Tubby is a smart man, he came prepared... with his water pistol! Use this weapon to POP those ducks out of existence.</p>\n\n<p>Credit:</p>\n<p>Mattabulous (Programmer) -\u00a0https://twitter.com/Mattabulous_</p>\n<p>Goest (3D Modeller) -\u00a0https://twitter.com/Goest__</p>\n<p>Bruno\u00a0(Musician/Composer) -\u00a0https://twitter.com/realechostudios</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:22:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/421/4212ede1821a358a6881b6715e8aa9f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mattabulous", "Goest"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
