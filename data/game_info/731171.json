This isn't that, but I took inspiration from that in places. Also I really wanted to get a better idea of bipsi scripting. And it's technically still goblin week 2022 for another hour or so. So I made this. I might fix or add to it later if I\u00a0get the time, but it's good enough for now.</p>\n<p>On your travels you come across a goblin camp plagued by a mysterious cursed item. Talk to the goblins to help them get uncursed.</p>\n<p>Use WASD or arrow keys to move around. Bump into things to interact with them. In some cases, the goblin you talked to to last will matter to the goblin you're talking to! Find and help them all to end the game.</p>\n<p>Made with bipsi.
