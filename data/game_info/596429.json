It's a very simple version of any old Block Breaker game. The slight twist is that the paddle is curved upwards! Ooooooo!</p>\n<p>10 levels worth, the ball speeds up as you go along and you only have 1 life. Good luck and see how far you can get!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Click to start the ball</li><li>Move the mouse to move the paddle</li></ul>\n<p>Note: There is a button in the top left corner of the screen (little white dot) that will auto-move the paddle for you, if you would just like to see the different levels, or if you're having too much difficulty with a level. Note, it simply goes where the ball is, so it might take a while for it to finish the level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T18:25:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/437/4374e995ab3a0575cf68bfe17f70a4bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Swordy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
