Rarer and more difficult-to-catch items award more points, and some unlock special art in the score screen. We planned to implement a lot more custom end screens and unique objects, but this is the first game we ever made.</p><ul><li>Chris Bonilla: Programming &amp; Design </li><li>Christina Goefron: Art </li><li>Justin Acker: Music &amp; Sound, Play-testing</li></ul><p>Praise for I Can Haz One?</p><p>\".. very simple, and kind of stupid, I still like it.\" - Chris Sanyk, csanyk.com</p><p>\"Dammit, dat music\" - Team-KwaKwa, ludumdare.com</p><p>\"I'd like to hear what the three of you told each other when you decided to make this\" - l'ilinx, ludumdare.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e28/e28572b8ec35455541e5f77e6ac30860.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["8 Keys Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
