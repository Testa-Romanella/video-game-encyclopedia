You are one of the brothers. Your friend is the other one. At the beginning, one of you will get a UNLUCK. The player with UNLUCK can't pick the money or...a goat. He can only lose money (at the beginning both players have 100 coins).\r\n</p>\n<p>Players will lose 1 coin per second. After two minutes of gameplay, it increases to 2 coins per second. After three minutes to 3 etc...\r\n</p>\n<p>Player with greyed out portrait is the one with UNLUCK.\r\n</p>\n<p>Player's outfits change depending on the amount of coins they have (rich and poor outfit).\r\n</p>\n<p>There are three different endings!\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Victory of the 1st brother\r\n</li><li>Victory of the 2nd brother\r\n</li><li>They both won because they defeated the UNLUCK\r\n<p><em>To unlock the 3rd (alternative) ending you have to take a water bag as a brother who is free from Unluck at the moment. Then you should go to your brother with Unluck and you will unleash both of you from fate. This option is available when someone's gold is &lt;=40.</em>\n</p></li></ol>\n\n<p>You can play on a gamepad (2 gamepads required) or keyboard.\r\n</p>\n<p>Just move by using analog sticks or WSAD + arrows.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>We chose a \"Heritage of Ukraine\" theme.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our game is based on a Ukrainian tale/legend \"<strong>The Brother of Bad Luck\".</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We created a mini-world with places from this tale. Both brothers are playable characters. A goat and coins are also included.\r\n</p>\n<p>The art style was inspired by Ukrainian folk (with modern folk accents).\r\n</p>\n<p>We also made music based on Ukrainian modern folk like Go_A or Kalush instrumentals.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Code: Szymon Rzosi\u0144ski, Adrian Nowak\r\n</p>\n<p>Art: Karolina Margielewicz, Kamila Chmielowiec\r\n</p>\n<p>Music, sounds: Justyna Kry\u015bcio\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>!!All the assets were made by our EGID Studio team!!</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional note:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The movements in the animations of the brothers don't change when one of them becomes poor and their clothes change - because happiness shouldn't depend on money, but how you approach life.\r\n</p>\n<p>Money can make it infinitely easier and more comfortable - but the value of life should never be determined by one's wealth.\r\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes some <em>unluck</em> may stick itself to us - and even though it might be tempting to think it's better when someone else has it, there's another option. And that is to help and accept help, to work together without viewing the less well-off person as inferior and instead welcome them in a warm hug.\r\n</p>\n<p>Because we're all humans here. And if we don't work together, even though we might get wealthy while someone else suffers, that bubble may always burst. While when we work in unison, according to our own strengths and accepting (and working on) our flaws, we can accomplish wondrous things.\r\n</p>\n<p>#gamejam #UnitedwithUkraine #UnitedwithUkrainegamejam\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T05:51:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c7/0c7a6df4dd02ace0ecbab22801dab5d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdrianNowak97", "Juice Tea"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
