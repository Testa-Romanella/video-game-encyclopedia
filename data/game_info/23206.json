With their plane stripped of its critical components, their only hope of escape is to chase down a gang of thieving villains across the perilous landscape.<br />\nMiles &amp; Kilo is a super tough, super fast-paced platformer by Michael Burns. Each of the game&#39;s 36 levels can be cleared without stopping, making it a perfect choice for fans of speedrunning!<br />\nBoth Miles and Kilo have their own diverse sets of moves and abilities: Miles can wall-jump, slide, punch, and toss fruit at pesky critters; Kilo can somersault through breakable walls and dash through the air to pounce on nearby baddies. Levels also feature a variety of rides, including mine carts, rope swings, surfboards, and more!<br />\nA special Time Attack mode is unlocked after beating the game. Here you can compete with your fellow gamers via online Steam leaderboards -- can you finish the game with the fastest possible time and the lowest number of deaths?<br />\nMiles &amp; Kilo features 31 normal levels, 5 special boss levels, a dozen old-school style cutscenes, and a totally rad chiptune soundtrack by Chris Kukla.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-15T17:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/921b4cd7fb29edef1cf9669af64095d3.jpeg", "website": "http://milesandkilo.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 29, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 103, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "iOS", "Xbox One", "PS Vita", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Four Horses", "Michael Burns"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Michael Burns", "Four Horses"], "esrb_rating": null}
