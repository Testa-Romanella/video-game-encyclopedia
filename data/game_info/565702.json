I don't know, which is why I'm releasing this alpha version to find out if others enjoy it as much as I do. Gather a few friends (if not in person, fire up\u00a0Parsec and play remotely)\u00a0and try to end up with all their mass.</p>\n\n<p>Each player can join a game by pressing a button on their gamepad or the keyboard (only one player per keyboard currently.)</p>\n<p>Pressing the Action button (spacebar on keyboard, A on Xbox controller,\u00a0 X on PS controller) toggles a player's ready state. When everybody is ready, the game begins.</p>\n<p>For movement on a gamepad, use the left stick or D-pad. On a keyboard, use the arrow keys or WASD keys.</p>\n<p>There will be a 10 second countdown, during which players can use their Action button to drop their black hole. It's a secret drop, so there is no indication when it happens. Any player who hasn't dropped their black hole by the end of the countdown will drop theirs wherever they are at that point in time, then everyone can start dropping mass.</p>\n<p>Using the Action button to drop your mass strategically, attempt to draw or push everyone else's mass into your black hole. Indicators of how much mass reserves each player has are located on the left side of the screen.</p>\n<p>If you drop mass too close to your own black hole, it will initially be repelled instead of being attracted to it.</p>\n<p>If you haven't dropped anything for 5 seconds, a piece of mass will drop automatically.</p>\n<p>The player who accumulates all the mass (the only one with any reserves remaining and the only one who has active mass onscreen) is the winner!<br/></p>\n<p>The Abort button (ESC on keyboard, Start on gamepad) during gameplay will pause the game. Pressing Abort again will end the current game, but pressing the Action button will resume the game. Use the Abort button from the player joining screen to exit the game.</p>\n<p>This is an ongoing project, and I intend to be improving visuals, adding audio, and fine-tuning (or maybe coarse-tuning)\u00a0gameplay. The easiest way to stay current with any updates is to install via the itch.io app.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T06:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/629/6299abdb050e3bbb7bedab9e1b2d580d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HSIMOSoftware"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
