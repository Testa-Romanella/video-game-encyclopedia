Inspired by games like 1080\u00b0 Snowboarding, Max Twist takes the concept to the space age. Fly down colorful track sections dodging rocks, walls, and other obstacles all the while twisting as much as possible! <br/><br/><strong>Embark</strong> on a journey through exhilarating tracks where you will have to avoid obstacles, to keep your board moving through the different levels of the game. As they intensify, you'll have to learn how to beat your previous feats and improve your skills to be the best and earn all the achievements available to you. <br/><br/><strong>Who knows what perils await you! </strong><br/><br/><strong>Be sure not to step off of your board!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Details:</strong><br/><br/>Max Twist is a level based game where the player starts in a virtual space station. <br/>This acts as the game menu and allows the player to select the game he or she would like to play. <br/>There are 9 tracks in the first iteration of the game, and the player will have to unlock all the tracks as he plays through the game. <br/>There is a tutorial level to help the player get started. <br/><br/>The panels in the game are touch based currently and do not have controller functions for them as of yet although this is planned in the future to make the game easier to use, but for now the game is tested on HTC Vive and cosmos. <br/>Also it is being tested on Oculus Rift and Rift S. <br/>These are the only ones we have to test with currently, but as we grow and build upon our knowledge of VR we intend to expand our games to all VR platforms and we might even make versions for regular PC, or consoles for more successful games.<br/><br/>We always appreciate input from the community and hope you enjoy our little game, so that we can make it a better bigger game and eventually make much better games that captivate people with the imaginative minds of our team.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-27T06:24:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa8/fa89ac3c74c319e3c7b4bec48fddb7b4.jpg", "website": "http://black-sun-games.com/projects/maxtwist.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black Sun Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Black Sun Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
