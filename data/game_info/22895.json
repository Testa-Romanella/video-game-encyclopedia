He\u2019s been \u201caround the block\u201d, so to speak. It\u2019s quite an accomplishment for a man wearing a suit that\u2019s been out of style long before it was manufactured. He\u2019s seen it all, from sleazy nightclubs and seedy bars with alleys that should be avoided at all times. He\u2019s even gone native for a bit and grabbed a piece of the island life. His life has been full of tight spots and pulsating pectorals. His lizard\u2019s always lounging and looking for love in several wrong places, the more the merrier! Always willing and able to perform some undercover work, our man Larry is a swingin\u2019 single guy out for some action! His lines are as groovy as a record and his strut is something to be seen!\n<br/><br/>\nLeisure Suit Larry\u2019s Greatest Hits and Misses features the loveable loser Larry Laffer in five complete adventures with throbbing suspense, pulchritudinous point-and-click action, and some parsing on the side!

Help Larry score as you hit the town of Lost Wages, Nevada which \u201clooks like a huge neon dinosaur making it with 6,000 acres of electrified sequins\u201d, the scintillating sandy shores of Nontoonyt Island, and go to  Los Angeles and paint the town red. Celebrate Larry\u2019s finest years and remember, big things come in small packages!\n<br/><br/>\nIncludes Leisure Suit Larry 1-6 (LSL 6 is in VGA and SVGA), the VGA remake of Leisure Suit Larry 1, and Softporn Adventure.
