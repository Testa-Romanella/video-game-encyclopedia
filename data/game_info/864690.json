And that sucks because I loved this game concept and had many other ideas such as blocks that you can only break through while sliding, but sadly I wasn't up to the task.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T10:36:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/2368cf1c963313907f289426dd376285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dunne2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
