If you'd like, you can play co-op, giving each bot to a different player so two players have to join  together as well.</p>\r\nHandBot is controlled using WASD and Space\r\nEyeBot is controlled using the arrow keys.\r\n<p>Press L to restart a level if you trap yourself (or if you encounter a level-breaking bug I didn't notice)</p>\n<p>Note: The game's audio bugged out last minute so I was forced to obliterate it. Oh, well... At least most of the game is mostly functional.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:11:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d76764080f748c7d79f204a4f9e5e0d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Trigonaut001"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
