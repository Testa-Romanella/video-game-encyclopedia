Aside from a little camera and vertex buffer code that was repurposed from a previous project, this project was made entirely over the course of about 10 non-consecutive hours (assuming the Project Use Time field under the Main Options in GMS2.3 is any kind of accurate).<br/></p><ul><li>Terrain is procedurally generated with a cellular automata system.</li><li>Theoretically, if a system were setup to save chunks externally instead of in memory, this system should be capable of generating infinite worlds (outside of an integer limit or something getting hit with the coordinate system). In this prototype, terrain generation is limited to positive coordinates and a 100x100 grid of 8x8x20 chunks - I think even that will run into memory issues if anyone tries to generate all 10,000 chunks with the x86 build - maybe not with the x64 build, though.</li><li>Once terrain is generated, the chunking system runs pretty smoothly. Things do get a little choppy when new chunks need to be generated in real time, though. This was alleviated somewhat by using the YYC, but I'm still not satisfied with the real time generation.</li><li>Didn't get as far as implementing any sort of collisions. So, there isn't anything to do beyond check out the terrain that was generated.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Movement - WASD</li><li>Look/Turn - Mouse</li><li>Ascend - Spacebar</li><li>Descend - Shift key</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T07:03:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/502/502dc74fe6a00d9e27757e3626aa5ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mushroomstick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
