It was born into a dark world and needs your help to reach towards the light.<br/>* In the darkness under ground, our little seedling must endure four seasons and many challenges before it can break through the soil and into the daylight.<br/>* As you play you can gain new skills with which to help your plant blossom.<br/>* All the different levels are designed as a Chinese puzzle, each more challenging than the last.<br/>* Zeta, the famous pianist, used to work for Blizzard, has been invited to compose background music, assuring it will be a unique game play experience from the designer of \"\"where is my water\"\" series games.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>* Use your fingertip against the screen to dig through the soil, giving the plant space to grow.<br/>* Growth requires energy. Go for the water crystals to replenish energy.<br/>* When the energy bar is empty and the seedling couldn't break through the surface, the play has failed.<br/>* Red props lower your score, so try not to hit any. Blue items are good and can increase your energy.<br/>* Different skills and different seedlings make for interesting game play and beautiful blossoms.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:56:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d04/d042cefa00c6d90308e449985701b20b.jpg", "website": "http://grow.joy4you.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Le Heng Interaction (Beijing) Culture Co.,Ltd."], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Le Heng Interaction (Beijing) Culture Co"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
