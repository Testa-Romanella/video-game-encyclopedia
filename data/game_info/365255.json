Once you have finished you can press f to view the world's history as it progresses. You can still place more tiles while this happens though it is required that you place a village before viewing the history in order to avoid bugs. Throughout the world's history you will watch as villages and castles are abandoned, destroyed, and nuked. I hope you enjoy this game as it is my first on itch.io, though not the first I've ever made.</p>\n<p> </p>\n\n<li>Click to visit my website</li>\n\n<p>Update Log:</p>\n<p>Version 1.0(for itch.io version): few bugs and close to what the final product will be.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T06:30:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18e/18e05c2d465c81b8eeabc079e1709757.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LDGamingExpress"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
