This packet contains everything you need to play including blank character sheets and 1 page of rules, which can be used alone or in conjunction with content from other d20 based systems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guiding principles of the rules are as follows:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Short and easy to learn\r\n</li><li>Compatible with other d20 systems\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Enough flexibility for mechanics geeks to layer material from other systems</li></ul><p>The result is a game that reflects the basic structure of more complex rpgs like D&amp;D and Pathfinder, with classes and ability scores. However, it reduces the math necessary by relying as much as possible on the base ability scores rather than derivations thereof. Additionally, rather than keeping a tally of spell slots, players will have a pool of spell points which can be spent to cast spells.\u00a0</p><p>*Submitted to the Unfirst Ever Jam as minimalist, rules-lite rpgs have definitely been done before.
