This is the only compiled, playable, finished game I had in the directory. I know I have shared this before, but for some reason I had taken it down. Figured I would toss it up here for fun along with the source code. No guarantees it will even compile anymore, I'm sure things have changed with haxeflixel since I have used it. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d41b1704b17c0c3406a0ef09d0dad10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Jonathan Hirz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
