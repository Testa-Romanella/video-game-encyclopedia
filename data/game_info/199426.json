On the select level screen you can see which you have already completed (green instead of white picture).</p>\n<p>Controls:</p><p> WASD/arrow keys for movement</p><p> Left mouse click to shoot</p><p> Right mouse click to use the selected card</p><p> Mouse wheel/numbers 1-4 on keyboard to select cards</p><p> Space to jump</p><p> Shift to sprint</p>\n<p>The green rectangles on the bottom left of the screen are your mana crystals. You start each mission with one crystal and get an additional one each round until you have five.\r\nOne turn are five seconds. Each turn you will draw a card (if you have less than four) and your mana is replenished.\r\nYour currently selected card is highlighted in yellow.If you don\u2019t have enough mana to play this card the highlighting will be in red. <br/></p><p>In each mission the goal is to kill the boss. It is big and glows red. You can\u2019t miss it. Although it may be hiding in some levels. Look around.</p>\n<p>Technology:\r\nBlender, Krita, Gimp, Unity, cubase elements, ableton</p>\n<p>Team: <br/></p><p>Johannes Alef:    Programming, 3D models <br/></p><p>Rebecca Schieren:    Programming, Art <br/></p><p>Hong Linh Thai &amp; Maria Rumjanzewa:    Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0db/0db72687298201416e60b752177e2dce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrMadCat"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
