The theme of the jam was \"Coots\" and \"Ten Minute Games.\" Coots is Ludwig's adorable cat, and ten minute game is pretty self explanatory.\u00a0 The game was made in 9 days using Gdevelop, and I had a great time learning this genre. Coots' Crucible currently has:</p>\n<p>6 Weapons , 3\u00a0 upgrades per weapon(Except for one with no upgrades.)</p>\n<p>6 Passives,\u00a0 5 different enemies, 1 boss, 1 cute little cat.</p>\n<p>TIPS/MINOR SPOILERS</p>\n<p>Standing in the blackhole makes you immune while it's visible. This is was just a work around to an issue I was having, but I\u00a0like it, so it stays.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There may be a bug with some of the upgrades. If you are offered the same passive, that is not a food passive, odds are it won't do anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any issues or concerns, please let me know down below and I'll respond when I can. Thanks for playing and good luck to the other participants!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T12:19:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/747/747563d85a967ab92e6fda337635cf63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["NUTT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
