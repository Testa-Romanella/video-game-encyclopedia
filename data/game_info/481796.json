{"id": 481796, "slug": "freshly-polished", "name": "Freshly Polished", "name_original": "Freshly Polished", "description": "<p>Created for the Low Rez Jam 2020, Freshly Polished is a game where you take on the role of a store clerk attempting to stock shelves. However, the floors were just over-polished and are now extremely slippery! And if that didn't make your job difficult enough, the customers aren't exactly happy about it either and want to speak to your manager!<br/><br/><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Your goal is to stock as many items to the shelf as you can before your shift is over. To do this you must head to the back room and look for the blue objective circle which will indicate where you need to pick up the next item. Once you have it, head back out to the store floor and look for the green objective circle that indicates which shelf the item belongs on. Rinse and repeat.</em><br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Freshly Polished has both keyboard and controller \u00a0support. A controller is recommended,\u00a0 although not all types of controllers may work. On keyboard, both the arrow keys and wasd will work.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T06:24:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f9294d837e9f7eaa89594ecca5e66ae1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blocky"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
