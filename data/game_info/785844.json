To get to some items, you will have to solve a logical problem in building a path (where to climb or jump). You need to be careful while traveling. You can crash, drown, die from unknown radiation. The task will become more difficult or easier depending on the time of day or the weather. If you get lost, you can always load from a save point.<br/>\r\nAlso in this adventure you will be helped by the explorer's suit.
