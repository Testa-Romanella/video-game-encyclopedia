I'm slowly building out the areas from the starting point. The ideas is to give the player freedom to explore the space in whatever order you want, but interacting with the world will give you access to deeper sections. There are only a few interactions worked out at present.<br/><br/>Some Tips:<br/>- The game is meant to be as esoteric as a dream, so actions sometimes have unexpected results</p><p>- Some of the areas are still devoid of stuff to do as they are new,<br/>- Try everything, there aren't any downsides to interactions currently<br/>- See if you can get the house key (*beep* *beep*)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T02:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f15/f15e3c89415ec61509252e0f76eea49b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BBoth"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
