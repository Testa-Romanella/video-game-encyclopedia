What sets Origin of Storms apart is that the characters have the ability to transform into powerful elemental beings that not only change their moveset but boost each character in a unique way. Some characters will have heightened attack power while others may get a speed boost. The transformation to and from their elemental states will allow players to come up with unique strategies on how to overcome their foes in battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>2 Playable Characters ( 10 Final roster )</li><li>Unique Transforms per Character</li><li>Unique Elements per Character</li><li>Arcade Mode</li><li>Versus Mode</li><li>Training Mode</li><li>Online play available through Parsec<br/></li></ul><p>This game is currently in PROOF OF CONCEPT stage, using a mix of original assets and repurposed ones.
