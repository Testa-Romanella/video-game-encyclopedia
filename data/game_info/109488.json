This mechanic creates a pseudo-puzzle element where you have to redirect the pistol's movement by using the walls and gunshots to massacre enemies. It also features stark and dark aesthetics inspired by Sin City, Hotline Miami, and terrible b-movies. Currently it has plans for an initial PC, Mac, and Linux release with hopes of eventual console launches.</p><p>The music and most art assets are temporary. until I can get someone more capable to redo them.<br/></p><p>Please support us on Kickstarter and vote for us on Greenlight!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/293/293195fad3758bb4c604ffecc187c61e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["NineMileGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
