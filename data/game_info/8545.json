{"id": 8545, "slug": "the-quest-lost-archipelagos", "name": "The Quest - Lost Archipelagos", "name_original": "The Quest - Lost Archipelagos", "description": "The Quest - Lost Archipelagos is an expansion to The Quest, a beautifully hand-drawn, immersive and enchanting world full of exciting challenges. After enabling the expansion, you can explore new areas and quests. However, if you don&amp;#39;t have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>This expansion has been designed for advanced players. If you are new to The Quest, we highly recommend you first try THE QUEST LITE (which is also free)!<br/><br/>The story: You have just returned from your long and weary quests, in need of a vacation. But as fear spreads through the land, Mersant sends for the best: you, to solve the mysterious happenings. Your enemy, however, has grown stronger during your absence. He has allied with a powerful magician, who is hell bent on destroying you. As an early fog sets in on your boat, your entire world changes; the waves grow higher and higher, until the whole boat is tossed upon a foreign shore. You are the sole survivor. The land is a savage place, a war always in the works, as the two enemy clans battle it out for control of the islands. You must defeat the enemy wizard, fight savage Lyches, defeat a powerful Phoenix Queen and rescue a warrior from the famed Flying Army. But brute force will not get you very far. In strange lands, strange things happen. And this is the strangest land of them all.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select &amp;quot;Lost Archipelagos&amp;quot; as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 45 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.<br/><br/>The Quest - Lost Archipelagos has been developed by CivilStriker and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/248/24801f9161b6ddc0962fa159e2411cdc.jpeg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
