If so, Squanimals Math Jump is a fun way for them to practice.<br/><br/>Help Red Fox jump from platform to platform reaching ever greater heights by correctly answering basic addition problems. All the while collecting flowers and encountering butterflies, birds, planes, other Squanimals, satellites and even the International Space Station.<br/><br/>There are two modes to choose from depending on your child's proficiency:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Easy mode </strong>is for the child just starting out, who may require a little more time to solve their problems.</li><li><strong>Normal mode</strong> is for the child who's a bit more confident. They will have about 10 bounces to solve the next problem before the platform they are on breaks. But don't worry, along the way there are chances to collect balloons that will save Red Fox from falling when a problem is not solved in time.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Development Details</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Engine</strong>\u00a0- Construct 3\r\n</li><li><strong>Artwork</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0 hand drawn with a sharpie, scanned and digitized using Inkscape\r\n</li><li><strong>SFX</strong>\u00a0- Mouth noises\r\n</li><li>Playtested by a 7yr old\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T06:38:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94f/94fbbee045a712e1c21e8f325609ca7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["squanimals"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
