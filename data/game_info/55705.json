It was published by Viacom New Media. Based on the Star Trek: Voyager license, the game followed Kathryn Janeway and the crew of the USS Voyager in their attempts to rescue members of their team from the Kazon. Voyager was the first game in a multi-title agreement between Viacom and Looking Glass, and Viacom took a minority equity investment in the company as part of the deal. However, Viacom decided to leave the video game industry in 1997, and Voyager was cancelled in spring of that year. In response to Voyager's cancellation, team members Ken Levine, Jonathan Chey and Rob Fermier left Looking Glass to found Irrational Games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce32a069446066fd9f96dc431a7484ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Looking Glass Studios", "Looking Glass Technologies"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Viacom New Media", "Viacom"], "esrb_rating": null}
