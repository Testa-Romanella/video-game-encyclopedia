You may find the game too easy or you may find it too hard, I'm not really sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, if you are having trouble completing the game, just know that there are numerous clues placed throughout the game, both visual and literal. \"The broadcast room\" is a place you can certainly find...</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed the soundtrack to the game, I will be releasing a compilation soon. So just follow my page so you can find out when it comes out.<br/></p>\n<p>I want to extend a special thank you to Adam Le Doux for designing the Bitsy game engine that I used to make \"Jung Campus.\" While I am much more of a composer and sound designer than a game dev, I love telling stories and creating worlds for people to experience.\u00a0 With the bitsy engine, Adam has given us a way to do that without having to adopt more complex systems.\u00a0You can follow Adam here.</p><p>I hope you find enjoyment in my work. There will be much more to come.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Take care -TC<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f6/4f62548ec2c9f5d834a89de74be0a65b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tom Ciccone"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
