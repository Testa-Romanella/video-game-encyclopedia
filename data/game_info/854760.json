To do so:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Open Terminal\r\n</li><li>Type in \u201ccd\u201d and then the directory of the downloaded game. Then press enter. (for example: cd Downloads)\r\n</li><li>Type in \u201cchmod +x MacOS.app/Contents/MacOS/'AutumnHike' and press enter\r\n</li><li>Turn off Terminal\r\n</li><li>Click on the MacOS file while holding control on keyboard. Then choose \u201cOpen\u201d. The system should prompt you that the software comes from an unknown developer (that\u2019s us!). Tell your Mac to open it regardless. If nothing happens repeat Step 5 until the game opens.\u00a0\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>If you have any other questions, contact us!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:19:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f89bad8587f452b18f209f9ffcfb2a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Piesuprawny"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
