It was built with Unity, and the sounds were recorded from a cheap 10-hole\u00a0diatonic \"C\" harmonica I bought online. You mostly play it with just the mouse, but you can use keys if you want to get fancy. It sounds more like a piano than a real harmonica, because it is not a real one. But at least you can learn your favorite songs, or write your own, and know exactly how to play them on a real harmonica later.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Mouse left/right = Move harmonica</p>\n<p>Mouse up/down = bend note</p>\n<p>Mouse wheel = Scroll up to blow, scroll down to draw</p>\n<p>1, 2, 3 keys = bend pitch by number of semitones indicated on the\u00a0key you hold down</p>\n<p>Tab = activate Free Bend (allows you to bend notes you wouldn't be able to on a regular harmonica)</p>\n<p>Q key = quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d67774c1fb7f17cbbe35290599a92d45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["colorVision"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
