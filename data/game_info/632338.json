Mutations of the spike protein can have significant impacts on both infectivity and antigenicity, so this app will introduce you to the basis of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations and what they might mean for global health.</p>\n<p>This application was developed by Sarah Iannucci, an MSc student in Medical Visualisation &amp; Human Anatomy at The University of Glasgow and The Glasgow School of Art.
