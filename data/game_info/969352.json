{"id": 969352, "slug": "jump-lanes", "name": "Jump Lanes", "name_original": "Jump Lanes", "description": "The steam train revolutionized transportation on Earth. It was only a matter of time before the same thing happened in space with different technology. Take control of a company building jump lanes through the timeline of their development. Will you build a successful company or fall behind your competition? Each turn you must decide between expanding your network, exploiting economic opportunities, or upgrading your hardware. Be careful which decisions you make; too much time upgrading may allow others to get the best opportunities first.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe core of the game is a series of scenarios with a set of specific goals to achieve within a certain time frame. Each round you receive three turns and must choose what to do carefully. Will you expand your network, implement new technologies, or focus on deliveries? Each time you take a turn any competition also gets to take a turn which may cause them to get to the best opportunities before you. However you must also consider profits in the long run. Profits are not immediate and also decay over time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe primary inspiration is train-based board games. If you enjoy those then this game was made for you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T08:11:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fea/feaad4650287749dccde63121778ffcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GargantuanCake"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GargantuanCake"], "esrb_rating": null}
