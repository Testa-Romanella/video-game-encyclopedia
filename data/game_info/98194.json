I just wanted to finally finish something, after more than 2 years just playing around and producing unfinished projects. At first I tried looking for someone to help me and actually do the coding for me, but since no one was up for it, in the end I decided to try and do it all on my own. And I somehow made it!!! Everything I wanted to be in this game- it's there! And coding is so addicting. Most of it actually happens in my mind, I wonder how something could be done for hours before actually sitting and trying out some code. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhat is this game about? <br/>\r\n\tWell actually...Just a game about 3 penguins and one random kid that appears there only for the shinyness.There's no logic in the 'plot', seriously.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Art, characters, programming:</strong> psyAlera<br/>\r\n\tMusic from: \r\n\thttp://www.tam-music.com/ || http://www.yumemiduki.jp/<br/>\r\n\tLSF Link: \r\n\thttp://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15121\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDeviantArt: http://fav.me/d4yq5pm\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tEngine: \r\n\thttp://www.renpy.org/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebc380514dc39dfbd5e42f7d482161fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alera"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
