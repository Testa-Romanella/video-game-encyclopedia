I'm going down!\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>A 2D crafting survival sandbox, this game gives you a whole mysterious planet for your new home. If you want to survive, you\u2019ll need to fight, defend and adapt to this world and change it to suit your needs. You can use whatever you need - wood, stone, iron, clay, and even more materials found on the planet. This planet might look peaceful and friendly during the day, but when the darkness comes...<br/><br/><br/><br/>The night is fraught with hordes of zombies and many dangers. In the depths of dungeons, deadly monsters and ancient evils wait for you. But you\u2019ll need to gather your courage and venture inside. For only in there will you find the quality materials you need to make advanced equipment, craft powerful weapons and armor, fulfill missions and quests, and unravel the many secrets of this planet.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Sandbox Gameplay:</li></ul> Change the planet as you choose.
