{"id": 630679, "slug": "drifters-dont-brake", "name": "Drifters Don't Brake", "name_original": "Drifters Don't Brake", "description": "<strong>Drifters Don't Brake</strong> provides a very satisfying drifting experience. <br/><br/>D.D.B. differs from other games of the genre by not allowing the player to control whether the car is accelerating or not. In D.D.B. your car is always accelerating!<br/>The only way of reducing the car's speed is by <strong>drifting</strong>.<h3>Game Mechanics:</h3>The game consists of hand-designed stages and challenges, and a level editor for playing and sharing your own maps. Perfect for speed-runners, the game provides many different ways of completing the same stage. Shortcuts might help you get a lower stage time, but don't think it will be easy to get them.<br/><br/>Another way of getting a faster performance is by drifting close to the walls. This dangerous but brave activity will provide drifting points to the player. Drifting points will later impact the stage's final completion time.<h3>Game Modes:</h3><ul><li> <strong>Regular -</strong> Simply beat all the stages to complete this game mode. The game will save the lowest time you took to complete each stage.<br/></li><li> <strong>Collectibles -</strong> You will be required to collect at least 1 (up to 4) item in each stage. The game will save the lowest time you took to complete each stage with the biggest number of items collected. In case you complete a stage without collecting any item, you will have failed to beat the stage.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T02:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d46/d4610efcb3fe906db3e0f3e94688e401.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arthur R Teles"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Arthur R Teles"], "esrb_rating": null}
