I'll probably add more maps and monkeys in the future because its really easy to do so and none the less I hope you enjoy.<br/><br/>please follow me for more updates to this game or my other games. considering this is only the first version of my game there is still a lot of improvements to be made. maybe your most hated bug will be fixed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:46:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/ded2b1b80cde38be7e6496ea8ca0b248.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DiregamesOfficial"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
