Do you trust your friend to help you get past the level? Or will you take advantage of the level and kill your friend to lower their score so that you will win?</p>\n<p>This game was made entirely in the <em>Godot Game Engine!</em> This is my first game, and is a project made for the <strong>2022 Multiplayer Game Jam,\u00a0</strong>hosted by\u00a0<em>Lone Rabbit</em>. The game to this point was developed over the course of about 9 days, which was the length of the game jam.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing this, the game consists of only a few levels. The majority of the time put into this game was used to design a framework to make it easy to design levels. During the last couple days of the game jam, I got sick and was unable to work on it. So, due to the time constraint, there are fewer levels than I would like to have.</p><p>Unfortunately, we were unable to add music and sound effects before the deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Trevin Jones - Game developer/programmer/level designer</li><li>Jaden Jones - Artist/level designer</li></ul>\n<p>All assets were designed by us specifically for this project.</p>\n<p><strong>Future work</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are a number of things I would like to add to or change about this project going forward, but as it stands I don't intend to turn this into a full game, just a fun side project. These are just a few of the things I intend to change.</p>\n<ul><li>More types of machines</li><li>More levels</li><li>More options</li><li>Bug fixes</li><li>Longer levels</li><li>Better intro level</li><li>Level balancing changes</li><li>Music and SFX</li><li>And much more</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:36:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c8/6c8a3db7a3be9ea9afc4642c7e613f34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["prysmic"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
