Before playing or trying the game I must tell you the controls, in the arrows on the keyboard you go right or left, in Z you build, in X you cut the trees, in C you destroy your blocks, in V you shoot the enemy, when you cut a tree it will give you 1 wood, when you have 2 wooden you can create fires by pressing the arrow on the keyboard,\u00a0This campfire will damage the silt, this campfire will hurt the slimes. The game has a bug that I haven't been able to fix, when you die it will appear, you have to reopen the game and that's it. The game is in development, this is only a trial version, with your support I will be able to improve it and I will also accept suggestions in the comments When the sun goes down a box will appear, to win you have to go to the box and touch C. Thanks for reading.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T19:06:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e106a6fffb749aa11f7cebafa8152389.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanDh5XYZ"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
