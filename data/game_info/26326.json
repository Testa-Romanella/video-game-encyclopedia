This collection of \n      games was available on portable LCD devices, and each title featured a \n      game and a clock. Each Game &amp; Watch title features two modes of play: \n      GAME A (normal difficulty) and GAME B (more advanced play). While some \n      controls have been changed in the DSiWare version to better suit the \n      Nintendo DSi system, the appearance of the game itself has not been \n      altered.\n    </p><p>\n      Conveyor belts carry tubs of cement to the mixers below. Use the \n      elevators to move Mario to different levels of the factory, dumping \n      cement from the top mixers to the mixers below and into the trucks. Earn \n      points for every load of cement you drop from the mixers to the cement \n      truck. Receive mistake icons by letting a mixer overflow with cement, \n      trying to get on an elevator when you are not level with it, or hitting \n      the floor or ceiling while riding an elevator; receive three mistake \n      icons, and it\u2019s game over!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1a/a1a67f369d9fa0d0a441624e203b9c85.jpg", "website": "http://www.nintendo.com/sites/dsiware/gameandwatch/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
