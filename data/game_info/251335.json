The mission, led by an Aelther Warlord code-named \"Neptune\", was to occupy a camp of Looset Empire. This particular camp was a threat to the southern territories controlled by the Kingdoms Alliance. It is generally believed that this raid had one survivor. It was Neptune, who actually betrayed the others in the raid, but used the incident for personal gain. </p>\n<p>Alcein was one of the knights sent by the Council under the command of Neptune. He saw, first-hand, Neptune's betrayal. His faith shattered, he soon found himself wandering between the the worlds of the living and the dead. He was revived by a demon, and made more powerful with three other souls living in his body. With his new-found power, he returns in a glorious blaze, slaying thousands, and claimed a title in his own right.</p>\n<p>Of course, the demon that revived Alcein made a contract with him, and is fully expecting to be paid when the contract is up. Will Alcen's thirst for vengeance spark another war? Is there any way he can make peace with himself before his contract is up? </p>\n<p>F<strong><strong>EATURES</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n+ 8~10 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY (1 Hours for the Demo)\r\n+ ACTION BATTLE SYSTEM, it's XAS ABS :)\r\n+ 4 PLAYABLE \"SOUL SHIFT\" CHARACTERS with their unique \"Dungeon Skills\"\r\n+ 13 SUB-CLASS to choose, from melee, magic to hybrid class is yours.\r\n+ SKILLS CRAFTING, collect the Magic Stones to create your own skills.\r\n+ BATTLE OF MEDALLIONS Mini Game, challenge the NPC with your collected Monster Medallions.\r\n+ UPGRADE WEAPONS AND ARMORS, refine it and enhance it! :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93e6e3bc0329e01a8c155cbb40cd0df2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hossi Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
