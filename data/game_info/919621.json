Keep attacking your opponent and dodging their attacks until either of you are defeated.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>A world of infinite creative magic has been oppressed by a council of wizards who seek to standardise spells to their own styles. Leaving wizards as the only class who can use magic, all other forms of magical expression are forbidden.</p>\n<p>One day, a street performing clown is spotted by a wizard and accused of using forbidden magic in his performance. Upon attacking the clown, the wizard slips on a banana peel and is defeated, leaving behind his magical essence. The clown inherits the wizard's magical ability and realises the power of magic, but in his own clown style.</p>\n<p>For the first time in over a century, someone other than a wizard is able to use magic. This begins an uprising lead by a clown to take out the wizard council and steal their powers one-by-one.</p>\r\nFuture Development\r\n<p>A vision for a full game with this premise would be best described as a Zelda-Mega Man mix. Selectable boss areas with a dungeon stage ending in a themed boss with a power you can obtain from them.</p>\n<p>Currently I wouldn't have the time available to begin expanding on this game until late 2023. I understand this is likely to weigh against my odds in the game jam, but I'd like to be honest about that. This prototype has been a great excuse to dive into Godot.</p>\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Created by Jerky\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Prompted by Pirate Software</p>\n<p>This is a prototype built for the Pirate Software Game Jam\u00a0with the theme: \"Unusual Magic\".</p>\n<p>My thought process being that clowns are magic users and they are unusual. So unusual that in a standardised world of magic, their type of magic would be forbidden. Thus, the battle between a clown and a wizard.</p>\n<p>Here is the Game Design Document used in planning this Game Jam entry</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T19:24:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49a/49aa258e028b5861fa9be14512e74923.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jerky"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
