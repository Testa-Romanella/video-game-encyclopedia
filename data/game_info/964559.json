This project joins <strong>experimental pop, psychedelic and techno sounds</strong> with virtual theater and space installations as it follows the 1920s Yugoslav zenitist drama text \"Eastern Sin\". <br/><br/>In consists of 4 songs: <br/><ul><li>(1st) <strong>Adam </strong>laments over the loneliness of existence, </li><li>(2nd) <strong>Eve</strong>'s ode to sensuality (referencing iconic Balkan pop-lyrics), </li><li>(3rd) <strong>Abrahamic God</strong> warns of their doom (this part is left in the original 1920s drama shape), </li><li>(4th) <strong>Adam and Eve</strong> leaving the Garden of Eden (adapted by writers Suzana D\u017euver and Una Kapetan). </li></ul><br/><br/>This work juxtaposes all those influences that created the <strong>contemporary global monoculture</strong>, from the 19th century onwards. Its elements are supposed to provide the wider context of the planet Earth in its variety (kaleidoscope of landscapes, architectural styles, historical events). The music is supposed to be the ultimate symbol of vitality \u2013 a high energy, Eros-fueled, powerful display of the joy of life \u2013 a blend of alternative and mainstream music: electronic sounds, pop melodies and Middle Eastern/Balkan elements.<br/><br/>Exploration of the influence of the Abrahamic religions and American pop culture on the global civilization by <strong>recontextualizing the story of the expulsion of Adam and Eve</strong> into a contemporary, globalized Eastern European setting. <br/><br/><br/>Combining procedures and principles from disciplines such as spatial and sound installations, video art, musicals, opera, theater, film, video games, etc. Dancing along the thin line between experimentality and likeability of pop culture. Discovering the expressive potential of new technologies. <br/><br/>Fresh and original take on the positive sides that the globalism and American pop culture had on Eastern and Western Europe, as it accentuates the positive common values of the USA, Europe and \"the East\" - in this way encouraging an emancipation from \"identity segregation\", encouraging the artists not to shy away from \"Eastern\" or \"Western\" heritage in their own culture but to use them as their own freely and incorporate them into their work. It also seeks to crush the dichotomy between \"elite art\" and \"popular art\", showing how they always complement, inform and inspire each other and are deeply intertwined.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-07T03:07:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d28/d289e03efa9d4a1b0b8fe4609e645498.jpg", "website": "https://www.stankogagrcin.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hajduk Arthouse"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Hajduk Arthouse"], "esrb_rating": null}
