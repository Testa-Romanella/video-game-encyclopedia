This can be done once every 3 seconds. You will lose the game once the ball is off camera.</p>\n<p>You get points for interacting with certain elements in the level, like the spinner or bumper. At the end your reached height will be added to the points.</p>\n<p>If you played the game it would be greatly appreciated if you took part in this small survey to further improve the game:</p>\n<p>https://forms.gle/ApRSsSLA41WFaSva7<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T14:19:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1e/b1ec6243c41376e9138c6a7076ed1dd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["silvallis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
