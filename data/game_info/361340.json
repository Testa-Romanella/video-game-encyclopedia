Ideas had to be shelved and I dont mind, this was a great experience and\u00a0I hope you find something interesting about it and I\u00a0apologize for\u00a0any bugs you experience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd4/dd4ed178981fcd026d308cb2ef05aa13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JJMT"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
