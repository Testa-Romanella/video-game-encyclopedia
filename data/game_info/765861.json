I'm unsure if I'll continue this, and how much I'll add to it if I\u00a0do happen to come back to it, but I figured it was cute enough as a short prototype to share here for now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T12:02:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46d5958a00e7f13b2c848214324153f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["2bitFox"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
