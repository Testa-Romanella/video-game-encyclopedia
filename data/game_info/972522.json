{"id": 972522, "slug": "the-dark-mod", "name": "The Dark Mod", "name_original": "The Dark Mod", "description": "<p>A dark and moody stealth game, inspired by the <em>Thief</em> series by Looking Glass Studios, <em>The Dark Mod</em> includes creative new gameplay features, dozens of unique AI, and a complete set of custom art assets, allowing players and mappers alike to enjoy missions in a gothic steampunk universe. When you play <em>The Dark Mod</em>, you feel like you\u2019re playing a gothic stealth game.</p>\n<p>This game is first and foremost a toolkit, allowing fans and team-members to create their own stealth missions in a gothic steampunk environment. But there are already over 160 full missions for download, including some small campaigns, so it certainly feels like a game. The only difference is that you have to choose which missions to install and play.</p>\n<p>Each mission is like an interactive short story, where you play the main character, a thief with his tools like rope arrows, gas and flash mines, lockpicks etc. You break into buildings, loot places, solve mysteries or simply try to get out alive.</p>\n<p><em>The Dark Mod</em> started as a <em>Doom 3</em> total conversion mod. As of version 2.0 it went standalone and there\u2019s nothing left that\u2019s recognizable from <em>Doom 3</em>, as in <em>Doom 3</em> is no longer required.</p>\n<h1>Setting:</h1>\n<p><em>The Dark Mod</em> world can be viewed as an alternate version of our own. It is a mixture of several historical periods, with architecture ranging from medieval castles to Victorian mansions. In this world, steam and clockwork technology were discovered much earlier in history, allowing for odd inventions and industrial warehouses to exist side-by-side with Gothic cathedrals and sword-wielding city watch.</p>\n<h1>Editor:</h1>\n<p>We also maintain our own mission editor, called Dark Radiant. It is an updated version of GTKRadiant, and has a lot new features (Python scripting support, many bug-fixes, new Particle preview, Texture Tool etc.) and comes with a number of Dark Mod related plug-ins like an Objectives or Conversation editor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-21T00:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/725ba784adcddd8605863c598fea7ce6.jpg", "website": "https://thedarkmod.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
