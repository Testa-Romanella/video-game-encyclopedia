In the game you play as a dwarf who is on a mission to kill an evil demon.\u00a0 He has three tries to beat the boss before he is lost forever. However every time he dies he is brought to a mystic shop where he can spend souls in order to buy new gear, but each piece comes with a curse. See if you can beat the evil demon!</p>\n<p>The game misses polish like a menu and may have some bugs (due to the time limit of a game jam). Who knows? Please report any issues you might find with the game!</p>\n<p>The game includes sound effects from Mixit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T21:19:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12d/12d2877dab510acd3773185027e5babd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emil"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
