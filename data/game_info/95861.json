This is a visual novel designed to create awareness for this form, and other forms, of anxiety and depressive disorders. Your character decides how to interact with other characters, who either show you support or impatience. If you make decisions to isolate yourself, or let the negative thoughts take you, the dark mass of \"Fear\" creeps further and further into your mind.\u00a0 There are many ways to combat anxiety, and there is no single solution for everyone, but seeking support is always a good first step. This is the first game I have written and designed and it could not have been completed without the incredible talent of the members of Tech Valley Game Space in Troy,\u00a0 New York.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Trigger Warning: This game includes depictions of anxiety through audio and visual elements which may be difficult for some.</p><p>A couple minor bug fixes for issues that broke the game:<br/>Line 697 - Changed 'sceneb' to 'scene5b' for script.rpy<br/>Line 537 - Changed 'q' to 'y' for script.rpy</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/847bc2b48f28796ac4b4797de8fc7e42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["modefy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
