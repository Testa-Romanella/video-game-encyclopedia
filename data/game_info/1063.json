Innovations included the ability to play all the main characters as the game&#39;s protagonist, and to this day, its epic story intertwining each of their fates is still highly rated and wildly popular.<br />\nWith plenty of abilities available and the magicite system for controlling spells/summoning, players can develop their characters any way they want. This was also the first Final Fantasy game to include the Ultima Weapon, the most powerful sword of all and a recurring item in subsequent titles within the series.</p>\n<p>The War of Magi left little but ashes and misery in its wake. Even magic itself had vanished from the world. Now, a thousand years later, humankind has remade the world through the power of iron, gunpowder, steam engines, and other machines and technologies.</p>\n<p>But there is one who possesses the lost power of magic--a young girl name Terra whom the evil Empire has kept enslaved in an effort to harness her power as weapon. This leads to a fateful meeting between Terra and a young man named Locke. Their harrowing escape from the Empire&#39;s clutches sets in motion a series of events that touches countless lives and leads to one inevitable conclusion.</p>", "metacritic": 92, "released": "1994-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-21T12:19:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/98c/98c87b286cd2a2ba942167df384a9bd3.jpg", "website": "https://finalfantasypixelremaster.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/", "rating": 4.38, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 137, "owned": 717, "beaten": 282, "toplay": 160, "dropped": 121, "playing": 31}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 80, "ratings_count": 370, "suggestions_count": 444, "game_series_count": 27, "reviews_count": 376, "platforms": ["SNES", "Android", "PC", "iOS", "Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Square Enix", "Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Square"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Sony Computer Entertainment", "Square"], "esrb_rating": null}
