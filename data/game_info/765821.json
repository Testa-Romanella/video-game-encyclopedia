If the runes are destroyed or you fall in battle the goblin army will march beyond the gate into your homeland.</p>\n<p>This will be your last stand...</p>\n<p>- WSAD to move<br/>- Space Bar to Jump<br/>- Hold Left Shift to Sprint<br/>- Hold Left Mouse to Attack<br/>- Hold Right Mouse to Block (limited use / on a cooldown)</p>\n<p>Added 4/6/2020<br/>- New UI to better indicate which towers are actively being attacked<br/>- Goblins have a small chance to drop a heart which restores a little bit of health when picked up<br/>- Bug fix for Game Over screen not being interactable if you were killed due to being out of bounds or if all three towers are destroyed (Thanks Geo3D!)</p>\n<p>Notes:<br/>Sadly I didn't have time to really test and balance much. The game could also use a full pass on feel and polish. It's a bit bare bones with regards to features but the general premise is there. I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T11:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/887/887b88832ddddfa16a392bc73e4d9879.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Diannara"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
