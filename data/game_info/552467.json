The more trash you pick up, the heavier you are and the slower you move, which in turn will get the kraken to find you more easily, so you must manage your cargo very carefully and avoid carrying too much in one go.</p>\n\n<p>PS: this game is best played in 1080p, there is some weird scaling with certain resolutions.</p>\n<p>All art made by Nicolas Vandendriessche, all music and programming done by Maximiliaan Hendrikx, as well as most sound effects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits for the sound effects I didn't make myself:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/amholma/sounds/372181/<br/>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lCRoEj8ah1ChssA3SpDva19TvC4nqT9f<br/>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/421184/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/352513/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/420880/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/421184/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/straget/sounds/408741/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31e/31ea00bf3f732e01b7ebc02d92b41aab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["bobbes4321", "Koni106"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
