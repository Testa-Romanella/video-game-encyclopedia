Each scene is a small, encapsulated experience.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nScene 1: Office Toss\u00a0it\r\n<p>This first scene puts you in the middle of an office cubicle, and allows you to <em>throw</em>\u00a0 common desktop items into the trash. Once the task at hand is completed, the user is now a certified AGILE MASTER\u2122 \u00a9 \u00ae \u2117 \u2120 \u2e2e</p>\n\r\nScene 2: Light\u00a0Room\r\n<p>You are now immersed in a dark room, full of dreams. <em>T</em><em>hrow</em>\u00a0your dreams and watch them bounce around in zero gravity. You can also turn gravity on or off at will, leading to a more exciting scene. Each time a dream collides with something, it makes a sound.</p>\r\n\r\nScene 3: Paint\u00a0Ball\r\n<p>Open your eyes: You find yourself in a white room. Almost every object in this room is white, and placed before you is a new kind of paint. This new paint forms solid drops of color that you can<em> throw</em> to coat entire surfaces in the room. You can even paint the light shades or TV to change the ambient light in the scene.</p>Source<p>You can see all of my Unity Source Code on my Github page.\u00a0</p>Post-Mortem<p>Please see my post on Medium for a detailed outline and post-mortem analysis.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3da1e78f5ad81548c3c25ecaa8793e1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jet Drift Collective"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
