The theme for LD35 was \"Shapeshift\".  While this is a Compo entry, I actually only had right about 24 hours to put it together due to unforeseen circumstances.  Very stressful and nearly decided to make it a Jam entry instead but was able to get just about everything in the game that I wanted so here we are!</p><p>The game is ever so originally titled \"Shape Shifted\".  Instructions will display, but basically you use A, S, D, F to change the shape in the capture boxes in the lower part of the screen (with the first box being A, the second being B, etc...).  Match them to the falling shape to gain points.  Capture, or chain, matches to increase score multipliers, gain extra lives, and cause shapes to appear and fall faster.</p><p>White shapes = 10 pts<br/>Green shapes = 20 pts &amp; fall about 30% faster<br/>Red shapes = 50 pts &amp; fall about 50% faster</p><p>If you fail to match a shape you'll lose a life and half the points the shape was worth.<br/></p><p>View the Entry on Ludum Dare:  http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=p...</p><p>Engine: Unity 5.3.4 <br/>Scripting: C# <br/>Graphics: Paint.NET <br/>Audio: Combo of Audacity, Bosca Ceoil, and Audiotool<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51f/51f8916c7f44e53826c0a966cb0c12fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Simple Potential"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
