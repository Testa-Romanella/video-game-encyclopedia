I can see that you rather read about the game than play it. But let me tell you about it, its a typing game like no other. It deconstructs these kind of games which are overly gamified to the point that they aren't fun.\u00a0 This game is just about typing, there is nothing pressuring to type faster, you take it at your own pace. Of course I\u00a0use my amazing omnipotent voice throughout, because what is the fun of the 4th wall if you don't break it? Anyways, you should stop reading this and play the game, I\u00a0really think you will enjoy it. See you on the other side!</p>\n<p>- Vittorio Corbo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T07:26:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f8f913a1fd05cf1ae687b2160bb6da8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vittorio Corbo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
