I chose to create a first person shooter that focus on the atmospheric scene as well as the ominous sense of an abandoned town.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are still quite a few bugs and tweaks that need to be made in the game over time but this is a highly polished slice of a potential game that could be developed further. The enemies in the game do not have proper models yet and are currently just target dummies but over time I will add proper enemies to the game as well as fix certain bugs in the game that I discovered at my University showcase.</p>\n<p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER</em></strong>: * Assets and sound used are not my own.
