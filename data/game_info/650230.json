{"id": 650230, "slug": "elemental-rancher", "name": "Elemental Rancher", "name_original": "Elemental Rancher", "description": "<p>A small town was devoured by a planar tear, and consumed by the Elemental Planes.  Most of the townsfolk died, but a few survived by attuning to elementals and becoming mages.  The elementals remain in the Elemental Plane, but the mages left with their newfound magical powers.</p>\n<p>You're a friend of Ori, one of the mages, who's helping you to earn the trust of the elementals and become a Mage yourself.\u00a0 In your quest, you'll uncover the reason behind the original tear, and possibly find a way to prevent it from happening again.</p>\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>The gameplay revolves around exploring and collecting Elementals, which can be harvested for their Aspects or used to help build the farm.\u00a0<br/>Harvested aspects can be used to craft new items and build new upgrades, while farming can be used to make money to buy new items, or buy new upgrades. <br/>The farm system has a crop breeding system, allowing you to make your crops grow more quickly or use less water, while the elementals have stats which control how quickly they fade away and their size. <br/>Finally, you'll be able to send gifts to the Attuned Mages in hopes that they'll be willing to offer you aid in your quest to attune to one of the Elder Elementals.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD: movement. <br/>Mouse: Look. <br/>Scrollwheel: Change Hotbar Position. <br/>E: Interact. <br/>Left Click: Activate Hotbar Item. <br/>I/Tab: Open/close Inventory.\u00a0 (Also closes all open inventories.)<br/>P/Escape: Pause game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In-Inventory:<br/> Left-Click: Move item. <br/>Right-Click: Drop Item.</p>\n\n\r\nTips/Dev Notes:\r\n\n<p>-There's a lot of missing or programmer art in this right now, mostly for devices, plants, and items. For now, all items are white orbs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0-All plants have 3 stages of growth, and only one has any logic to it. Don't worry about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-If a Dialogue Mirror has an Exclamation Mark on it, then the mirror has new dialogue to see.</p>\n\n\r\nThe Project:\r\n<p>This game is a project I've been working on over the summer to try to learn Unreal Engine better, and see what I can do when I'm not constrained by a game jam, and without having to manage a larger team.</p>\n<p>I've made something a lot more impressive than I expected, and at the same time I'm missing something like half the gameplay I was hoping for.\u00a0 Production's going to slow, or even stop over the fall as the semester starts up, but this demo should be a nice vertical slice of what the game will be like.</p>\n<p>Also, don't mind the random assets used for things like icons or farm plants.\u00a0 I tried to avoid using too many asset packs, to keep the file size small, and with the intention of asking if anyone else wanted to make specific art.</p>\n<p>And on that note, feel free to hop into the Discord!\u00a0\u00a0https://discord.gg/dGR5jmKTSG\u00a0<br/>I try to share my progress constantly, I ask for input on design ideas, take suggestions or even help for things like art or story boarding.\u00a0 We also hang out, play games, and I try to every so often livestream what I'm working on on there.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T08:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e16/e16b6a2e20f9091efb7a335cc57d7e37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jimlad42"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
