We are making this available again for those that are curious about the origin of the game and want to give it a try.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>It's quite a bit different from the full game and is best appreciated as a completely separate and much less polished\u00a0experience.</strong></p>\n<p>Key Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Level up your team with 5 different character classes and 6 different weapon classes!</li><li>Fight off hoards of android invaders in 5 different levels</li><li>Fun and engaging turn based battles (if a little slow and clunky at times)</li></ul>\n<p>Some reviews of the demo from 2016:</p>\r\nRetro Nuke<br/>It\u2019s a darn good demo. It could honestly work as a full game the way it is now...\u00a0Strategy fans will complete the six hour demo in no time as they plan and destroy squads of robots, and novice strategy gamers will pick up on the gameplay quite easily.\r\nHardlockup<br/>Early impressions are very promising. I like the overall feel of the game.\u00a0\r\nNew Retro Gamer<br/>After playing through a few battles, though, I found myself playing \u201cjust one more\u201d. Just to grab that nice assault weapon upgrade, or that operative class upgrade.. ooh, wait, this battle will reward an additional team slot\u2026 Ok, one more..just one more, promise.\r\n<p>The final version of the game is available on many platforms:</p>\n<ul><li>Windows/Mac and Linux on Steam, GOG and\u00a0itch.io</li><li>Nintendo Switch</li><li>XBOX one</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul>\n<p>Donating or downloading does not get you a key to the full game on itch or Steam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:38:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c1/5c1674191f961ad0c11b5778d5a8bb7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HOF Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
