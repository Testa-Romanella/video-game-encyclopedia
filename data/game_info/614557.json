{"id": 614557, "slug": "robo-escape-merbertmo", "name": "Robo Escape (merbertmo)", "name_original": "Robo Escape (merbertmo)", "description": "<p>Controls<br/></p>\n<p>wasd to move<br/>e to take control of other robot<br/>f to push block or other robot<br/>q to give control to ai (used by the ai)<br/>r to restart</p>\n<p>Goal:\r\nCapture all robots and move\u00a0them to the square that says \"win\". Robots controlled by ai will only do their actions when you press an input. You will initially have control of the robot in the top left. Once you take control of other robots, you will control them all simultaneously with each input you make.\r\n</p>\n<p>Green square tells you where the action will take place.<br/></p>\n<p>Different ai in the robots behave differently. There are Workers, Aggressors (kind of like a defense unit) Bully (like aggressor but pushes them around instead of turning them), and ones that just Shut Down. This paired with the defects give each robot a unique personality.</p>\n<p>Some robots have defects and won't follow the rules as you would expect. The two main implemented defects are \"reversed controls\" and \"deletes objects instead of other actions.\" Also, some robots have a limited number of turns after being captured until they turn back to ai controllers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Apologies for the convoluted mess and lack of clarity as to what defects each has. I planned to make it so you could click each robot to bring up a list of attributes, but ran out of time. I also planned on quite a few more defects, but without the clear representation of what's going on, that would just make it more confusing. I would like to create more levels and do more specialized puzzles with this concept, but again, I ran out of time. Hope you enjoy the prototype!</p>\n<p>Made by: Morgan Channell</p>\n<p>Cover Art Illustration by: Beastoleon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc4/bc4cb1891f2ea848ab440429a3b2ebaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["merbertmo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
