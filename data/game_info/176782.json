You are being worshipped by a local\u00a0village. The village has been suffering from famine and disease lately and to make things worse, a HORDE OF MONSTERS is besieging it!\r\n  </p>\n<p>It\u2019s up to you to protect the only reason you exist- the villagers, your followers. Without their prayers, you will perish.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Find out how many monsters you can zap with your lightning and how many waves you\u2019ll survive. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Prod your worshipers to pray faster, increasing your damage multiplier. You can even sacrifice a villager for an extra damage boost!\r\n  </p>\n<p>But remember: every villager generates a small amount of mana. When you or the monsters kill too many, you will run out of juice.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Manage your resources and strike with precision.
