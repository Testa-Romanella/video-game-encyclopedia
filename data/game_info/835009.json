This is a\u00a0retro bounce game with innovation on the gameplay mechanism. It deisgned for the people who like me to felling children experience. After the school, staying at home to experience the game which stay with our\u00a0carefree childhood.</p><p>I tried to use some very simple patterns to abstract the birds, building blocks, wooden doors, ponies, and windows in childhood. These things that are within reach in daily life are referred to in Japanese culture as: \"Material Sadness\". It contains thinking about life, feeling life, and nostalgic life by observing the small things in life. In Eastern cultures, this is a philosophy of life. Perhaps, this game is a nostalgia for my childhood and a tribute to traditional Japanese game consoles.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T16:52:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/135/1355807ce61498f28672675c9d70a675.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Boomocean"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
