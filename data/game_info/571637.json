Choose the right answears to forget the grief of your lost wife, remember moments and places you've been with her and meet old friends and locations trough this journey.<br/><br/>This jam version has only 2 levels, therefore, 2 chapters of the story. Our original script has about 5 chapters, but, obviously, with 5 people we wouldn't be able to make 5 levels with 5 different maps. So we made only the 2 first ones and will finish the others after the jam.<br/><br/>The jam theme was Wisdom and its \"limitation\" is: \"Weight must be a mechanic\".<br/>Our interpretation of the theme, and how we used it, was in a psychological sense of weight. Losing the weight, or burden, that losing someone brings to your life and experiences.<br/><br/>The game is point and click. So just click around, find people and objects, experience the game and tell us what you've thought.<br/><br/>Made by:</p>\n<p>Gabriel Scarabelot; Audio and Modelling - https://gscarabelot.wixsite.com/portfolio<br/>Nicolas Falk; Code and Post - https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-falk-06980ba8/<br/>Luan V.
