It was a learning process! I don't intend to expand on this game as space shooters aren't really my thing - it just seemed a simple place to start. I set a goal to make something and achieved it. Expect better things in the future :)</p>\r\nPlease marvel and be amazed\u00a0at:\r\n<p>-Over 2 types of enemies! a final boss even!</p>\n<p><strong>The Pizza Boys!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Exploding Hamburger Boys (Not barrel boys!!)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pizza Jr.!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pizza Sr.!!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And also our protagonist Mavery!! =^.^=</strong></p>\n<p>-5 levels I believe!!</p>\n<p>-5 exciting minutes of gameplay maybe more if you die a lot or less if you stop playing! Whose counting??</p>\n<p>-Deafening Silence! Who needs sound effects?? Make the noises yourself! Performance art?<br/></p>\n<p>-The <strong>first ever boss</strong> to have two shooty hands you have to destroy first before you can damage it!</p>\n<p>-Absolutely no attack telegraphing!</p>\n<p>-Dangerously unbalanced difficulty spikes due to <strong>RNG~!</strong></p>\n<p>-A shield mechanic! You can shield up to three hits! It only restores when empty!! tough luck pal!! Laser attacks cut right through it! Please be careful, I worry about you!</p>\n<p>-4 entire\u00a0health points! Iframes! restore health every 1000 points! go get em!!</p>\n<p>-3 powerups!<strong> The Pepper</strong> makes you invincible! <strong>The Cool Sunglasses</strong> give you triple shot! <strong>The Party Hat</strong> gives you 250% extra damage and rainbow colors!\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Progressively more annoying mini boss each level!</p>\n<p>-Jaw dropping spaghetti code, probably including entire functions that don't do a thing! What do I care? Nerd!! Oh my god please don't look at it!!</p>\n\n<p>-I will probably fix bugs if asked!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T06:34:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/670/67017812bf77b636d033136d8026bd27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoelleStuff"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
