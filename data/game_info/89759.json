BabaYaga is her distant north-eastern cousin, and they are not on speaking terms any more - ever since the Wolfman incident. No, it had nothing to do with the chicken-leg house which Yaga claimed as part of her inheritance, according to the court papers. The details are sketchy, rumors and gossip abound.
