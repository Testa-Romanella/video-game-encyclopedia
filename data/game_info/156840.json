You \r\nplay as a piece of Swiss cheez and do some rather bizarre things(you\u2019ll see \r\nwhat I mean). Music\u2019s my original composition, sprites (the better ones, \r\nanyway) done by Rich \u201cSpyke\u201d DeFrancisco \r\n(this guy), \r\nand many thanks to the Lazy Foo for \r\nteaching me everything I know about SDL.
