As the days progress and the reactor gets upgraded, more and more modules and tasks around the office will keep your hands full. Multi-tasking is the name of the game!</p>\n<p>There are 3 endings to the game, 2 of which are based on what you choose later in the game while 1 is a secret ending that can be achieved at any point. Can you find them all?</p>\n<p>We were perhaps a little over ambitious with what we felt we could do in the time-frame, as we would have loved to add more modules, office distractions and pointless tasks to make it harder. Perhaps a post-jam version is in order...</p>Aim of the Game\r\n<p>- Complete your given tasks every day.</p>\n<p>- These include generating a power quota via the reactor, sending emails and more.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>- Move the mouse to the edges of the screens to pan the camera left and right to look around the office.</p>\n<p>- All module and office task instructions are available to read in the manual to the very far right of the office.</p>\n<p>- Simple click on the green book in the folder to open the manual.</p>\n<p>- Once you are ready to start the day, click on the big red power button and the reactor will kick into action.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T12:15:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3b7633ee592e4151e83b4aa4903a48e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JaGTeK Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
