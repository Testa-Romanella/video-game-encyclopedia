The monster can only smell and hear you, but as long as it hasn't fully caught your scent, you can move freely.</p>\n<p>Don't Hide offers a horror experience where you're forced to manage the monster and explore the surroundings. Nothing is easy to find, as you'll always be surrounded by dreadful darkness. You'll be left searching for five barely illuminated keys, all scattered around the maze. However, your time is limited, as the creature trapped in the maze with you will will eventually catch your scent. Be sure to run away when close, and if it hasn't fully caught your scent, hide to get it off your tracks.<br/><br/>Don't Hide offers 6 different levels, all with varying difficulty and predetermined initial key, object, and exit door locations. A 3 star system will help rank your performance in each room. At least one star is required to progress to the next room.<br/><br/>Developed in Godot, this game was a side project of mine that I learned along with Godot. Updates may proceed the release with more levels, objects, or features. Its more than likely that I will release balance changes as well as more and more people play the game and test out the ranking system as well as the minor and major time (scent) limits.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>WASD = movement<br/>Space = hide<br/>Escape = open/close menu (pauses game), or go back to previous menu<br/>Enter/Left Click = Select<br/><br/><strong>Objectives</strong></p>\n<p>Find all five keys</p>\n<p>With 5 Keys, find the exit door</p>\n<p>Don't get caught by the creature<br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Sole developed: T0rt1z (Shawn F.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T16:32:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68a/68a7ba555d51c034ef0011ea8bf9929a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sulfic Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
