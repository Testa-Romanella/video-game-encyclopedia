Since the cylinder is not perfect smooth, this can make the ball jump unwillingly and with more power/speed the more wild the ball will react. I have tried many different methods in solving this, but none worked. So please don't get too mad and frustrated when this does make the game pretty unfair :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f63/f63b9c88ae72951db7bc34e88bdf6abf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mimersbrond"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
