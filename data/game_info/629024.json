The theme was \"Two Sides\", which we met by dividing the world and the player attacks in two, forcing thoughtful positioning.\u00a0 It is not a full game, but we tried to make it as challenging as possible in the time given.\u00a0<br/><br/>A thing to note for any confusion is that 'light' enemy take dark damage from the player's dark bullets, and 'dark' enemies take light damage. The light and dark damage only comes out of one side of your body.<br/><br/><br/>Created by Oliver Freeman and Andrew Jones<br/>Link to repository here: https://github.com/FakeOllie/LightAndDark<br/></p>\n<p>Sound effects acquired at the following links:<br/>https://jdwasabi.itch.io/8-bit-16-bit-sound-effects-pack<br/>https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T10:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bca134b8d8d5ec2ef7a5439f48e49ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dow", "FakeOllie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
