Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, the last remaining heir, returns to take vengeance.</p>\r\nSure, sure, but what is this?\r\n<p>It's a demo of a bigger project I was working on for the\u00a0Spooky September 4-Color Jam. My original idea (a platformer with three levels and four bossfights) proved way to big in scope for the duration of the jam. So I just cut off part of a level, added a score counter and infinitely spawning enemies and released it as a kind of Horde Mode.</p>\r\nThat's pretty neat. How do I play?\r\n<p>Controls are pretty simple. Arrow keys move you around. Jumping and ducking help avoid enemy attacks. \"Z\" is for your sword, \"X\" is for your gun. Hold it to aim, or just tap the button for a quick shot. Mind your ammo though.</p>\n<p>The game is very much inspired by Bloodborne. If you've done a visceral attack in that game, you might want to try the same thing here.</p>\r\nCool. But what's up with Critical Role? Is this an official game?\r\n<p>Nope. I've never had any contact with the folks at Critical Role and this is in no way supported or endorsed by them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T05:39:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ea/7ea804726c6333d597e69d07c106bfb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brain in a Bowl"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
