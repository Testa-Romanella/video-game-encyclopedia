The waiting chaw (at the entrance in the bottom right) will move to the place you click/Touch in the room.</p><p>Each level has a specific queue of waiting chaw. You must achieve the target score with these available chaw.</p><p>The \"peace\" score of each cell depends on its occupying chaw. The rules are:</p><ul><li>Black chaw are the coolest chaw in the universe. Their base peace is 8. No one can reduce their peace!</li><li>White chaw have a more warm personality. They love black chaw but fear brown chaw. Their base peace is 10, and is reduced by 3 for each bordering brown chaw, and increased by 1 for each bordering black chaw.</li><li>Brown chaw are agressive. They hate the company of other chaw, specially the active white ones. The base peace is 6. Neighbouring white chaw reduce their peace by 3.</li></ul><p>After the rules above are applied, the next rules enter:</p><ul><li>If a chaw peace score drops to 2 or less by the rules above (and <strong>only</strong> by those rules), <strong>the peace score will drop to 0</strong>, and the chaw becomes <strong>angry</strong>.</li><li>If there are any enraged chaw bordering a central chaw, it gets -4 peace. This reduction is independent of the number of enraged chaw in the vicinity. The peace will drop to 0 if the peace less or equal than 2, but they will not become angry.</li><li>If all neighbors of a chaw are black chaw, the central chaw gets a peace of 10 points, and it cannot be reduced even if there are angry black chaw in the vicinity. But this effect can be obtained if there is a single chawcake in the neighborhood!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/437/437d197006f80120591bb222df1bf2c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vinicius Osti"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
