{"id": 92649, "slug": "argentum-age", "name": "Argentum Age", "name_original": "Argentum Age", "description": "<p>Argentum Age\u00a0is a digital collectible card game with tactical elements and a focus on skill and positioning. Choose where to summon your creatures onto the board, but then watch as they have a mind of their own once summoned. You can still influence them with spells but you can&#39;t control them directly. Influencing them into defeating your opponent is all part of the skill and strategy of the game.<br />\nWe aim to be a community-driven game that is developed by and for its players. The game is Open Source and is designed to be moddable. We are also committed to\u00a0Argentum Age\u00a0avoiding any \u201cpay to win\u201d elements that some games feature.<br />\nArgentum Age\u00a0is currently in beta, and we welcome any feedback we can get. Please download it, try it out, and let us know what you think. Our\u00a0Discord Server\u00a0is the best place to meet us, provide feedback, and get involved with development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-14T08:15:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/73886da0291398e267101eb118f18406.jpg", "website": "https://argentumage.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["ArgentumAge"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
