After two years of conflict, Andras, a haughty armored knight who was called by his king to the war, can go back to his castle and meet again his spouse, Tim\u00e9a. But, Andras is the only fighter to come back to the castle.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He quickly discovers that the Gnobblars led by the Fattish King Kam\u2019Zoul plunder his domain and kidnap his wife. Andras takes up arms again, ignorant the demands of help of his peasants. He will quickly understand that he needs the assistance of his subjects to get rid of the Forest\u2019s Gnobblars and get back his spouse.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this first level, you start your journey at the castle of Andras, who is burning and deserted. You will find the first Gnobblars, little gobelins of soils colors. Andras in his armor and with his sword, the Messer, can easily defeat them one by one. Exit the castle to chase the Gnobblars in the dark forests and travel the wood bridge. You will quickly find the big cave which is the closest den of these dwarves. And certainly, Andras will get some responses...\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Use the arrows of your keyboard Left/Right to walk and the upper arrow to jump.
