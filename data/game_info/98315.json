On your road to freedom you will meet not only hordes of enemies, but also some friendly helpful characters.</p>\n<p>The game is dedicated to the adventures of resilient dwarflings in miner's helmets, mashing clay in the grim corridors of the gold mine which never saw the sun. The hard working dwarves are not sat idle. One is climbing the mountain risking breaking into the abyss. Another dug a pit. A third has fallen into it and cannot get out. Someone has even dropped a stone on a huge cave troll's toe. You are the one who has to watch over all of this mess.<br/><br/>Mind boggling puzzles, and indirect control over up to five unique beardies will make you suffer, cry, break your keyboard and call Mom unless you finish the final level in order to stop this nightmare.
