Control eight heroes and form parties of 4 in order \n      to defeat the Dark One! Along the way players will unlock new Abilities, \n      Tavern Music and full Soundtracks!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/717/7175e39f83bf526926c1abb451ac1cb4.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/DungeonHeartsDX", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["Wolfgame"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Wolfgame"], "esrb_rating": null}
