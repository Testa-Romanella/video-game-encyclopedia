Basically you start jamming at 1am on the night of Daylight Savings Time, jam for one hour, then the clock rolls back to.... 1am. Zero hours!</p>\n<p>This is a very simple game where you traverse a maze, avoiding slimes, and trying to get as deep into the maze as you can. The maze/map generation took up the first half an hour and all the player/enemy stuff took up the second half an hour. I'm sure there are some bugs, but... hey... it's jam code! :D</p>\n<p>If you want to watch this game get made in real-time, I livestreamed the whole thing and you can watch it here:</p>\n<p>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/503329820<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af13050dc8755e36158492dae7586a36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MBoffin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
