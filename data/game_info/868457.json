{"id": 868457, "slug": "holy-horror", "name": "Holy Horror", "name_original": "Holy Horror", "description": "<p>Holy Horror tells the story of Lona, a graduating exorcist who decides to drop in on her vampire bros. It\u2019s a little plot heavy, but the choices you make/objects you interact with will genuinely change the trajectory of the game. There\u2019s a lot of optional content that you don\u2019t need to interact with to progress, but have a hunt around because most of it\u2019s pretty fun.   </p>\n<p>It\u2019s ~20 minutes if you speedrun, about an hour if you try engage with everything/get all the endings.   </p>\n<p>There are 4 normal endings and 2 hidden endings.   </p>\n<p>It\u2019s free, but you can pay me in feedback! Please, this is my first game and if I get some helpful criticism, it\u2019ll definitely improve my later products.   </p>\n<p>If you like my style, and you\u2019d like to work with me on a project you can drop me a suggestion at lycusaberidge@gmail.com. I\u2019m more interested in working with programmers/artists because that\u2019s what I feel my game lacks, but if you\u2019ve got a really cool idea and you\u2019re not sure how to make the dialogue work/plot flow, that\u2019s great too. I like to think dialogue is my strong point \u2013 I really had fun making it in this game. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T08:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/767/767fda50c14194e3fb08f9a888393a7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deletedelete"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
