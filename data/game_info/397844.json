They can then take that new talent to the real billiard\u00a0table to become better players.</p>\n<p>I also wanted a companion practice and testing tool\u00a0for my recently released\u00a0Angle Detective playing and training system. Being donation-based, the playing system\u00a0is free for anyone to learn and can be found at\u00a0my website CueAndMe.com. It will teach you methods of detecting angles that will allow you to achieve higher scores\u00a0in the Angle Detective video game.</p>\n<p>Whether or not snooker and pool players\u00a0choose to apply\u00a0Angle Detective System methods, I am confident that\u00a0the Angle Detective video game will be a fun and\u00a0invaluable training tool to help their games.<br/></p>\n<br/>The Screenshots\u00a0 \r\n<p>The screenshots that I provided on this page are not random but take you on a journey through many of the\u00a0available features of Angle Detective. So please follow the images in the order that they are shown.\u00a0I included the cursor in several images to indicate what features I am using or about to use.\u00a0I\u00a0hope to add a video at some point when I can find the time.<br/><br/></p>\r\nGame Description\r\n<p>Unlike all\u00a0other billiard video games, Angle Detective is unique in that it is actually\u00a0a puzzle game.\u00a0The player has\u00a0the option of choosing\u00a0among 3 Modes: Professional Play Mode,\u00a0Amateur Play Mode\u00a0or Practice Mode.\u00a0The player also has the choice of\u00a0playing on Snooker or Pool equipment.</p>\n<br/>Play Modes\r\n<p>Each game is made up\u00a0of 20 shots. For each shot, the player is presented with a randomized shot setup consisting of a cue ball, an object ball and the center of\u00a0a pocket. The pocket's center is clearly represented by a small white sphere.</p>\n<p>The goal is to guess the shot angle of each shot setup as accurately as possible. The closer the player's answer comes to the actual shot angle, the higher the player's score is for that shot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The highest single shot score is 110 points for a perfect matching angle, and therefore\u00a0the highest score for a complete 20 shot game is 2200 points. The lowest single shot score is 0 which is given when the player's answer is 20\u00b0 or further away from the actual angle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>More detail about scoring is described in the Full Instructions inside the game.</p>\r\nProfessional Play Mode\r\n<ul><li>Overhead camera is unavailable.</li><li>Main camera is restricted to a maximum height of 1.78 meters (5' 10\") from the floor.</li><li>\"Freeze and Draw\" icon is unavailable.</li></ul>\n<p>Once the player enters an answer for the current shot angle, all of the above\u00a0restrictions are removed, and the player can then replay and practice that shot as long as they wish before moving on to the next shot. The score is unaffected by replay.</p>\r\nAmateur Play Mode\r\n<p>In Amateur Play Mode, all tools and both cameras are available without any restrictions.</p>\n<br/>Practice Mode\r\n<p>Practice Mode is very special. It is for angle visualization and Angle Detective System shape and pattern drawing\u00a0practice.\u00a0 Simply use the angle slider to select any shot angle from\u00a00\u00b0 to 90\u00b0\u00a0that you want to practice seeing over and over again to ingrain into your shot memory, and the computer continuously generates randomized shot setups at that exact chosen angle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Practice a shot setup as long as you want before moving on to the next randomly generated shot setup at that same angle. When you're ready to practice another shot angle, simply choose it with the angle slider and repeat the process as long as you wish.</p>\n<p>All tools and both cameras are available and without restriction in Practice Mode.</p>\n<br/>Special Features\r\n<ul><li>Infinitely Random (but with carefully-weighted angle ranges) Play Mode\u00a0Game Generation: No two games will ever be the same. <strong>Premium version only.

During testing, this formula has been shown to be imperfect and off by\u00a0a few degrees\u00a0at times. So in this version 1.0 first\u00a0release, the player's black object ball release\u00a0line is very close to actual but should only be considered to be a close estimate. If the game does well enough to be able to\u00a0afford updates, the next release should fix this issue.</p>\n<br/>Controls\r\n\n<br/>Coming to Android and iOS\r\n<p>I still have a lot of work and testing to do, so I don't know for sure when the Android and iOS versions of Angle Detective will be released, but they are on the way!</p>\r\n\r\nPlay Lite in Browser\r\n<p>If you have a Mac computer or if you\u00a0have a Windows PC but\u00a0would\u00a0like to try out the Lite version before downloading, follow this link to play it in your web browser. I may be releasing a Mac version in the future if I\u00a0receive enough interest.</p>\n<p>Angle Detective Lite Browser Version</p>\n\r\nMinimum Requirements\r\n<p>Angle Detective was developed using the Unity engine.\u00a0Generally, content developed with Unity can run pretty much everywhere. How well it runs is dependent on the complexity of the project.\u00a0Angle Detective is a fairly lightweight program.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Settings Menu also offers 6 Quality Settings options as well as the option to turn off the room environment graphics. In addition, I am offering both 64 bit and 32 bit installers, so older machines should run it fine as long as their operating system is\u00a0Windows 7 SP1+ or above.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But to be safe, please download, install and run the free Lite version of Angle Detective to make sure that Angle Detective Premium will run on your system. There would be little to no difference between the Lite and Premium versions with respect to the necessary system requirements.</p>\n<br/>Credits\r\n<p>Game Concept and Design: Jeff Swain<br/><br/>Programming: Greg Johnson\u00a0<br/>greg93john@gmail.com<br/>https://gregulargames.itch.io/<br/><br/>In-Game Framed Artwork: R.C.
