Emerge from being a lonesome cowboy over founding a settlement to becoming the mayor of a gold-digger town: there are hardly any limits to your personal endeavors.<br />\nYou start out as a lonesome cowboy who comes across an abandoned ranch and decides to stay. You start repairing and expanding. You gather food, hunt for animals and sell their meat and leather to settler trecks.
