It doesn\u2019t affect the gameplay at all but just looks odd!</p>\n<p>Second, there are pickups that increase and decrease firing rate. Like all buffs and debuffs, they last for a fixed amount of seconds, but the firing rate doesn\u2019t return to normal until you release the Fire key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/738cebf8bb825141d2fc0dc96ec67a33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James27"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
