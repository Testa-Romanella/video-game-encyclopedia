So the gimmick is that ocasionaly on kill your weapon changes! (So far theres 15 guns). Also the game is endless! So theres no end for now (Except death of course).</p>\n<p>I decided to upload it for now and maybe you can suggest some ideas or stuff idk. But it will receive updates! (As long as my pc is intact and the game is incomplete).</p>\n<p>The stuff that i will add eventually:</p>\n<p>1.Pause and menus of couse.\u00a0Half done!</p>\n<p>2.More guns! (suggest any if you want but please dont just make upgraded versions of the one that are already in game because thats boring).</p>\n<p>3.Choice to end the adventure without dying.</p>\n<p>The stuff that im thinking of adding but not sure:</p>\n<p>1.Cycle enemies that apear after the 4 zone.</p>\n<p>2.A boss after the 4 zone.</p>\n<p>3.Items that alter your stats.</p>\n<p>So thats it for now!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9b6a6e83f1e2e1102526201d5c7082e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CheeseBaron2"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
