Every house has a number and when you click on tab on your keyboard it shows you current letter with the house number and the house numbers are shown on the map. (press m on the keyboard) After you deliver 10 letters, you also have to leave the area to win the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nControlls - Movement - WSAD<br/>\r\n                  Current letter - TAB<br/>\r\n                  Map - M<br/>\r\n                  Deliver letter - left mouse button (aim on mailbox)<br/>\r\n                  Sprint - Shift", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T04:13:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93d/93deaf555f953c16f53489fc4aea1acc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Central B.G"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Central B.G"], "esrb_rating": null}
