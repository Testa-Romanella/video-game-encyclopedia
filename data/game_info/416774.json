Depending on the feedback and sentiments on the game, we might actually add more levels/story/depth/mechanics to the game and make it into a full game to be published for steam and consoles! (Only if people wants that)<br/><br/>Lastly, thank you for checking out Key Hero. Be sure to check out other games from our studio.\u00a0 As a very new game studio, we need your support. Bye!</p>\n<p>**Update**: As the Jam Host has extended a little bit of submission time, we've decided to upload a WebGL version of the game for more players to enjoy without having to download. This of course comes with a little performance sacrificing, for best enjoyment, please support us by downloading the game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:59:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/517/517c0b34a45e09b5f73f51374ad29764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["arukigames"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
