In this audio/visual experience the player will learn that within us all are the things we identify with, whether it be the colour of our skin, our sexual orientation or even just our values. We wished to focus on these identifiers, so the character you play as is constructed of your words, the identities you feel represent you. Understanding this fundamental notion of identity, we wanted to make our message acknowledge the differences in all of us (our diversity) but show that the power of diversity is through inclusion. The player will learn this as they see their character be accepted by others until the final message of the game is revealed. A message of \u201cUS.\u201d We very much enjoyed making this game and we hope that you enjoy playing it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T03:17:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc7/cc7e2c1657b83e511d142c2006dde13a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zingpro", "Fabi", "JoasBremer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
