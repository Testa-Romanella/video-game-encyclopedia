Strange creatures have attacked the power lines. The station has been evacuated. Do not stop here to refuel.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>*Message Repeats*</em><br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>You won a free pass for a vacation at a famous resort planet. You rented the best budget friendly ship you could find, hopped into the stasis pod, and dreamed of your relaxing trip to come.\r\n</p>\n<p>Waking up at a charging station because the automatic system didn\u2019t recharge your ship was not in the game plan. It seems your ship didn\u2019t receive, or simply ignored, the warning signal. The map of the facility shows the power stations still have power at least, even if the lines are down. How hard can it be to go collect some energy cells to manually recharge your ship?\r\n</p>\n<p>Grab a wrench and your trusty machete, put on your spacesuit, pack some space tape, and go Recharge Your Rocket!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick Start</strong></p>\n<p>Follow the path to the Power Stations. Collect the Energy Cells from the blue Energy Cell Racks and return them to the green Rocket Energy Cell Rack. Collect 4 Energy Cells to power your rocket. Use the action button to interact with the racks and the rocket.</p>\r\nEnergy CellPower Station<br/>Energy Cell RackRocket<br/>Energy Cell Rack<br/>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made for the GoGodotJam. It is still under active development, but has reached a playable state. The game is in an early demo state and is set to be fairly easy. You can beat the game in 5-10 minutes. This is our first game jam, and first playable game. We started learning Godot ~6 months ago.\u00a0 We look forward to hearing your feedback. We are continuing to work on this and will update it once the jam ends.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Some browser/controller combos are not currently working.
