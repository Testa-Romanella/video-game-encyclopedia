{"id": 854934, "slug": "super-holo-wars", "name": "Super Holo Wars", "name_original": "Super Holo Wars", "description": "<p>Super Holo Wars is about one simple concept: Take the member of Hololive and put them into giant robots and give them a world to play around in.</p>\n<p>To achieve this I'm using my custom Super Robot Wars style SRPG engine that is built on RPG Maker MV, SRW Engine MV. The engine is basically feature complete, so now I'm looking to use it to create something for other people to enjoy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The current demo gives a sketch of what this world I have in mind would look like and let's you play around with two units on a standalone map. In the end the idea is to give each Hololive generation its own mech design, but as I don't have a mech designer or artists yet to collaborate with  the demo features the Hololive members piloting some \"mass-produced\" models instead. Much to their chagrin.<br/></p>\n<p>If you are an artist who loves mecha and Hololive and would like to see one of your designs come to life in a game like this please join the discord so we can have a chat. We are also looking for writers who would be interested in fleshing out this world further. Familiarity with Super Robot Wars and its stories is a plus!</p>\n<p>And of course, everyone is welcome to join to keep up with the future development of the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Discord Invite Link</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><em>General</em></p>\n<ul><li>Movement: Arrow keys</li><li>Menu navigation: Arrow keys</li><li>Confirm: Z</li><li>Cancel: X</li></ul>\n<p><em>Game actions<br/></em></p>\n<ul><li>Turn menu: Press Z on empty square</li><li>Unit menu: Press Z on unit</li><li>Next item: Page Down</li><li>Previous Item: Page Up</li><li>Next sub item: Home</li><li>Previous sub item: End</li><li>Speed up cursor: Shift</li><li>Speed up actions and text: Z(hold)</li><li>Speed up text even more: Z + Page Down(Hold)</li><li>Ability details on status screen: Enter</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tips<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Be sure to make good use of the Pilot's Spirit commands to overcome the enemy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T10:33:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31e/31eaebc4a521bd5e51659698209a10f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["TShadowKnight"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
