I needed more time in the end so I entered\r\n it for the Jam. So it was made with all the rules of the Compo but with 72 hours. I love having to create a story or narrative for my \r\ngames but I can't say much about this one without spoiling it. I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>You'll only need you're mouse movement and its left click button to move and use the tools.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Things I didn\u2019t have time to finish and would be nice to add once the voting period is over<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sound effects </li><li>Tool animations </li><li>Visual feedbacks (Mainly particles)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Some ink and water color.</li><li>Gimp</li><li>Bosca Ceoil</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3a/b3a25b9db43028e80af3ad919ea9c88b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["You Be Strong"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
