Along the way you\u2019ll rescue your fellow slimes and free them from the oppression of the wizard.<br/></p>\n<p>Gravity slime is a auto-scrolling 2D-platformer with the main mechanic being that you can invert gravity. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T10:40:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/207fbd02e15fc3ef69275ae079c197de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaidAndReady"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
