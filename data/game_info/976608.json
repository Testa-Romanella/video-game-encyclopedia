Other than being able to bash off an opponent&#39;s arms, a technique called a Sunder is in the game. If executed when an opponent is stunned, it will destroy their lower body. The character will not be able to jump or use kicks, but can still move back and forth a little with the leg buttons.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-10T14:04:15", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": [], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
