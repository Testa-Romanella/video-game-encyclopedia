You, the competent thief, are invisible in the shadows and can only be seen in the light. You also make noise if you walk too quickly. Guards can only see you if you're visible in their range of vision (their vision can be blocked by corners) and they can hear noise waves you make within a small radius (about 2 blocks).</p>\n<p><strong>Steal all the gold</strong> in the level to complete the game.</p>\n<p>My prototype is being made in Game Maker 8.1 Lite.
