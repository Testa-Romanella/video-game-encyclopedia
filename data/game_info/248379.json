Mankind has left behind it's birthplace, an endless field of graves and ruins, and spread throughout the System to rebuild and survive. </strong></em><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>A greying convict wakes from cold sleep on a massive orbital prison as it plummets towards the surface of a haunted wasteland.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>A jaded V-POL detective travels the stars in pursuit of a mysterious masked killer that might be nothing more than urban legend.</em></strong><strong><em><br/>A young scientist who has lost everything leads a project to forge new life from the ashes of the Awakening.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>These are the stories that you will help guide and unravel. What...will you do?<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>This is Wanderer.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Wanderer</strong> is an episodic 2D adventure game blending cinematic platformer and RPG into an immersive and stylish lo-fi sci-fi universe. The plot centers on the character Rook, a man with a broken mind and fleeting memories of his past. Stranded on Earth after an oribital station crash landing, Rook team-ups with notorious happy-go-lucky hacker Jin \"Sunny\" Wei and sets out to assemble a group of ragtag survivors and misfits in search of a way to escape from the deadly planet.<br/></p>\n<p>During his mission, Rook will run into allies and adversaries in the form of dangerous gangs of fellow prisoners, the survivors of the Earth's mysterious apocalypse, and monstrous parasitic extra-dimensional beasts that haunt the open wastelands.</p>\n<p>At certain points in the narrative, focus will shift from Rook to a handful of other playable characters with their own stories as well, offering a more varied look at the world, history, and reality of life in the 22nd century.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Core gameplay fuses <strong>platforming</strong>, <strong>turn based combat</strong>, <strong>puzzle solving</strong>, and <strong>interactive dialogue/decision making</strong> into a story driven, atmospheric adventure. Tying it all together is a unique visual aesthetic that juxtaposes lo-res pixel art characters with a mix of surreal collaged and painted environments. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>The result is a highly experimental take on interactive storytelling, bringing design ideas old and new from a host of our favorite genres to try and create something that feels refreshing yet nostalgic at the same time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09e/09e0cab6cc9b52070a8bd13c51684eb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fenrir", "Red Cloak Games", "Cris_R"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
