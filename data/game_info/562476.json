The objective is to press the corresponding button\u00a0to deflect a shuriken of the respective color and survive as long\u00a0as possible.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the <strong>Mini Jam 74</strong>, where the theme was <strong>Chaos</strong> and games had to be made with a specific, limited control scheme. I also gave myself an extra limitation of making all of the graphical assets using only the 4 colors of the CGA palette. You'll only see 3 total colors in use, though, since I ended up not using the white color for any assets. It's all black, pink and cyan.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A\u00a0- Punch (deflects pink projectiles)</p>\n<p>X - Kick (deflects cyan projectiles)</p>\n<p>Space - Reset</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ec/7ecdfe3afb577f51efcc7cdf14e43bac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Santtu \"MFG38\" Pesonen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
