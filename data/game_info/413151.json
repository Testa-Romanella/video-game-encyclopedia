Takes about 1-2 minutes to play.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions.-<br/></strong></p>\r\nYou only need your mouse to play. The game will activate fullscreen mode after the menu. You can toggle it with F or Escape.<br/><br/>TINY SPOILER IF YOU ARE STUCK: You need to click on \"I'm not ok\" several times after the menu.<br/>\n<p><strong>Blurb about the game.-</strong></p>\r\nWhatever this game made you (or didn't make you) feel is the most relevant thing here. But if you're curious, this is about showing the frustation of not being able to fully verbalize feelings.\r\n\"How are you?\" is a simple question that can help people in dire situations. Keep in mind that, though asking it is a great gesture, the other part might not feel up for it. Never push people if they don't open up. It's a casual question and you can ask it again some other time.\r\nWe need to forget about mental health stigmas and remember that the most important thing is to check on those close to us.\r\n<p><strong>Technical blurb.-</strong><br/></p>\r\nMade using Construct and Mateus speech bubble template (I kinda butchered it in the process).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/485/48586411a86d1faa02d095e8807c923f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ludipe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
