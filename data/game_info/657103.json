Run away with WASD.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your only defense is an imaginary frog that can be summoned with space. But be careful! You can only summon a frog once every 3 seconds.\r\n</p>\n<p>When a frog and shadow creature collide, they will annihilate each other. The more shadow creatures you defeat with frogs, the more frogs you will be able to summon.\r\n</p>\r\nLinks\r\n<ul><li>Source code on\u00a0GitHub</li><li>Design document</li><li>Twitch</li></ul>\r\nTools Used\r\n<ul><li>GIMP</li><li>Tiled</li><li>Audacity</li><li>jsfxr</li></ul>\r\nLicense\r\n<p>All source code and artwork is available under the terms of the MIT license.</p>\n<p>Music used in this game available under the terms of\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0.
