As Sora stands in the crossroads, he gazes up at the night sky and thinks of his lost friends. Just then, a mysterious man approaches from down one of the branching paths. &quot;Ahead lies something you need,&quot; he says, &quot;but to claim it, you must lose something dear.&quot; The man vanishes before a single path, leading to a castle that eerily resembles a girl&#39;s drawing... In the coming journey, what will Sora and his companions gain, and what will they lose? In addition to Sora, players can control Riku in this adventure that bridges the gap between Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2004-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-21T19:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0a4/0a45869d5c720cecfd976b76b2fe2fd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.63, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 34, "beaten": 96, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 46, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 82, "suggestions_count": 390, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 84, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Jupiter"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
