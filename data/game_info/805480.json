A small creature is drawn to you as it fears the dark, so your job is to guide it to safety.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Shine your light around each level to explore and discover it\u2019s secrets, and complete the puzzles that lie within. Be aware of traps that can kill the creature though, as I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t like that too much, now would he?</p>\r\nDisclaimer**\r\n\r\n<p>Although I got a web build working, for a better experience feel free to download the windows version. The web build has some light glitches, but it\u2019s completely playable and shouldn\u2019t really alter the experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>I mapped the pause button to \u2018M\u2019 instead of \u2018Esc\u2019 on the web build so you can play full screen without it closing.</p>\n<p>Controls\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Use mouse to move light around.</li><li>Press M (web build) / Esc to bring up Pause Menu.</li><li>Rest of the controls are taught to the player in game.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<p>I used a combination of free assets and some I bought previously from humble bundles.</p>\n<p>Free Chick Mega Toon - Meshtint Studio</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/meshtint-free-chick-...</p>\n<p>Ultimate Low Poly Dungeon - Broken Vector</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/ultimate-low-poly...</p>\n<p>Dungeon Traps - Sugar Asset<br/></p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/dungeon-traps-506...</p>\n<p>RPG Orchestral Essentials - Jonathan Shaw<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.jshaw.co.uk/rpg-orchestral-essentials</p>\n<p>Music from Dark Fantasy Studio and GameDev Market (Both from humbe bundle)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T15:39:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be008a377fc27b01b6530ad9d7698b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["ByteSizePlay"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
