Now retold and reimagined within the open-source interactive storytelling software, Twine, new paths are possible to save the world of Gensuun. It features the beginning of our party\u2019s journey, at the final moments of their failed ambush of draconic goddess Suttony. After Suttony slays the party's leader, a Dragonborn Paladin, only one party member remains an elderly Gnome Wizard. In the hopes of saving his party from annihilation, the Gnome casts a powerful spell to reverse time so the party can form a better plan of attack. But, in haste, the spell was cast much too powerfully... and in the wrong direction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T04:27:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa0ad66a1cf7ec2cde93087599fc4740.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SamuelTeyssier"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
