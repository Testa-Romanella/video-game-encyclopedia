The theme was \"Failure is Progress\". In this game, failing to tell the stories in the correct order will let you know how many events happened in the order you gave and how many events are in the wrong order.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Grandpa will tell 3 stories. In each story, there are 6 events you can perform. It's your job to find out in which order 4 of these events took place. After you select 4 events (depending on the story, you'll do this differently), a notification will tell you how many of those events are in the right order and how many are in the wrong order. If you've ever played Mastermind, the board game, it's basically that. Be aware that since there are 6 possible events, there are at least 2 that didn't happen and in some stories, some events may be repeated.</p>\n<p><strong>Help!
