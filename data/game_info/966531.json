{"id": 966531, "slug": "flappyparrot", "name": "FlappyParrot", "name_original": "FlappyParrot", "description": "This is a very good mini game, where players only need to operate the small animal, make it fly, and avoid all channels, so that it will not fail the game due to collisions. The longer a small animal flies, the more points it can earn. This game is easy to use and is perfect for playing in your free time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n1. It has a very minimalist pixel style, and everything players see is composed of pixels, which is very simple and clear.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n2. Players can see a very cute little animal that will fly continuously.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n3. The small animals will continue to fly forward, and players only need to click on the screen to control the flight height to prevent them from colliding with the pipeline.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe difficulty of the game gradually increases with the player's gameplay, initially simple, but later becoming even more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame gameplay:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou need to constantly click the left mouse button to control the flight altitude and flexibly navigate through obstacles. When you encounter obstacles, the game ends!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T04:39:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f94/f94dfa00f2713e2bd216ff278486f9ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlappyParrot"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["FlappyParrot"], "esrb_rating": null}
