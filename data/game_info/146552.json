The game is full of ads for lootboxes and other awesomeness.</p>\r\nExcept all those pesky ads do is clutter the gamescreen. We know it sucks. But hey, we want your money.\r\n<p>However, we\u2019re not total pricks so you can move them out of the way or just close them. You can even jump onto them to help you with your platforming. See? We\u2019re the good guys! Anyways, you can shoot fireballs (after eating hot sauce), so this game is awesome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00b/00b1f185cd397a3735d88881d36700d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hooraygil"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
