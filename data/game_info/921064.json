This gnome will always carry a watering can that will act as the core mechanic of the game, watering the roots in order to interact with the environment in different ways. The key to this game is that it is a garden gnome made of water, so the water that the gnome pulls from the watering can is the water itself. This means that the levels have a limit to the number of uses of the core mechanics, thus limiting the movements within each level.</p>\n<em>Features</em>\n<ul><li>Playability with the environment: The key to each level is how the player makes use of such a simple gameplay system to interact with the mechanics of the environment that offer the player many possibilities for interaction.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Environmental narrative: The game talks about the waste of water and the exploitation of natural resources.
