That means you want a challenge. An extremely\u00a0hard challenge. This game is meant to make most other First Person Shooters look like a walk in the park (As long as you don't cheat).</p>\n<p><strong>The Odds:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You'll face off against a ton of different spawned enemies, each one distinct in its own way, and every single one of them a pain to get rid of.\u00a0And once you die... then that's it. Back to the checkpoint you go. Haven't reached the checkpoint? You guessed right. You'll respawn all the way back at the start of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>The Non-Odds:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It's not like everything in this game is against you, though. There are gaps left in the enemy AI\u00a0<em>on purpose</em> for master players to use to their advantage. You also have UNLIMITED Ammo and 2 guns, but it does not make the game any easier. If you get good enough, this might not have to be an insanely hard rage game for you... but still a pretty hard rage game.</p>\n\n<p>So ONE Checkpoint. NO Cover. UNLIMITED Ammo. And a VERY hard shooter. But are you up for the challenge?</p>\n\n\n<p>Nobody should ever attempt to redistribute the assets from this game or redistribute the game itself as a whole without my consent.
