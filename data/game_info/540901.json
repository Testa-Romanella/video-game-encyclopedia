For the theme mutation, I went with flying mutants, who use the official \"Land of Lisp\" 3D alien model by Dr. Barski! It's a great book and a great introduction to Lisp if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it. The game is far from polished as with any ludum dare game, however I\u00a0did join very late and I had to take some extra time to fix some bugs.</p>\n<p>The ocean shader might be a little much for web, it can be laggy on lower-end computers, and I apologize for that. Downloadable versions are available if that doesn't work out for your computer!</p>\n<p>This game was coded in Smalltalk using the GodotTalk virtual machine, which is a virtual machine I wrote that acts as a bridge between Godot and Pharo\u00a0Smalltalk. It's in active development and still pretty early on, but you're welcome to follow the development and join the discord here:\u00a0https://gitlab.com/chandler.justin.s/godot-talk-VM</p>\n<p>For those of you who played One-Way ticket:</p>\n<p>It's been a while since I posted a game, and I apologize for that. I know some of you might be waiting for part 3 of One-Way Ticket, and I promise that\u00a0I will be releasing it soon, or at the very least return to the horror games that most of you have followed me for. I appreciate all the kind comments you've all left and your continued support! The next One-Way Ticket will be coded in Smalltalk using this virtual machine I developed, and I believe the organization will help me produce games faster once I've ironed out the bugs, which I wanted to prove with this Ludum Dare.</p>\n<p>Thanks for viewing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:33:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/791/7912356354aa97c10bd8f69d45f318bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Consistency3D"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
