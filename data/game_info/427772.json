{"id": 427772, "slug": "taiji", "name": "Taiji", "name_original": "Taiji", "description": "Taiji is an adventure puzzle-solving game set in a mysterious world full of puzzles. Unlike many adventure games, the puzzles in Taiji all use a consistent interface:  a grid of tiles which can be toggled on or off. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlthough this might seem simple, the consistency of the interface frees the player from guesswork or pixel hunting that happens in many adventure games. It is always clear what the player must interact with in order to solve the puzzle, but it is never entirely clear what they must do. There are many different areas in the game, each with their own visual and mechanical themes. As you explore this dense world, it is important to think hard and to pay close attention, as vital clues are sometimes hidden in plain sight.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-17T21:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0d/a0ddcabc8609118d20e86516b8035182.jpg", "website": "http://taiji-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 39, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew VanDevander"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Matthew VanDevander"], "esrb_rating": null}
