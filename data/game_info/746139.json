Years later, you return to bury your father and move into the family home as you take his role as the town\u2019s lighthouse keeper. But, alas, things in the hometown are just as strange as they ever were\u2026</em></p>\n<p>The Lighthouse at Kindred Rocks\u00a0is a solo writing RPG that blends small town life with an investigation into eldritch secrets.<br/></p>\n<p>Use the one page document to start your journal about returning to your home town after your father's death and then investigating 2 different mysteries. The prompt table will slowly guide you through weeks of everyday life alongside minor investigations and surprises, as well as\u00a0interactions and opportunities to get your imagination and creativity cooking.\r\n</p>\n<p>I was heavily inspired by just my aesthetic love of lighthouses, and the places that surround them. If I see a lighthouse on a trip, I'm gripped by the desire to go visit it, stare at it, see what's around it. I can definitely draw a link between my love of eerie fiction and my childhood spent watching Australian TV icon ROUND THE TWIST, wherein a family moves to a small coastal town and lives in the lighthouse. I loved that show as a kid, and still do, because that setting just felt...boss. So I'm drawing from that deep childhood love, matched with the weird occult stylings of random stuff like: PAPER GIRLS by Cliff Chiang &amp; Brian K Vaughan, China Mieville, FRIDAY by Marcos Martin &amp; Ed Brubaker, maybe a little ROSEMARY'S BABY, and possibly even some of the \"what is reality?\" vibe of Philip K.
