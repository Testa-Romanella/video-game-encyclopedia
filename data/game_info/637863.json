(Jan Schneider)", "description": "<p>\"Box It!\" is a short and simple 3D puzzle game, <strong>playable\u00a0using the mouse only</strong>.<br/>The basic mechanic allows you to slide objects around on a grid-like stage to allow the ball to reach the goal.<br/>Currently the game contains <strong>12 levels with\u00a0increasing difficulty and with various mechanics</strong>.<br/><br/>I developed this game over the last two months in my spare time. I intented to have a rather small scope for the game with simple mechanics that could be used in various ways, so I could spent as much time creating\u00a0 interesting levels and polishing the game.<br/>In the end I think this game turned out great\u00a0as the puzzling is quite fun. <br/>I also enjoyed creating my first 3D game with Unity as I could spent time learning modeling objects and painting textures.<br/><br/>I hope you have fun playing the game if you have any feedback, I would highly appreciate it, have fun puzzling!</p>\n<p><strong>Please do not distribute this game without my permission.</strong></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Sandro Erhardt for playtesting and providing great ideas as always!<br/>Sound effects and music obtained from\u00a0zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:41:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/079ee11ec60ebb383382b95ec9f4717b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jan Schneider"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
