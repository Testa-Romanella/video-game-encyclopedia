He wants to destroy all plants on the planet so all living creatures cannot survive without his potion. You mission is to catch and stop him!</p>\n<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>\n<p>This game is made in GDL January Jam, and the theme is Breath(Air). In this game, the enemy doesn't need to breath because he can generate oxygen inside his body... and actually he will generate too much oxygen so that he has to release it\u00a0 very often, and this is how you are gonna get oxygen under water. Be careful though, since the oxygen is \"released\" from his body, sometimes it is not very clean...</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong></p>\n<p>When you are going down, you can only use Left/Right Arrow key to control.</p>\n<p>When you are going right, you can use all arrow keys.</p>\n<p><strong>Unfinished Content</strong></p>\n<p>I wasn't able to finish the game I planned during the jam time.\u00a0 I liked the idea, but there are still many things left to do, and the game is probably not fun at all at this point. I will invest some more time to try adding those unfinished content and polish the game after the jam is over.</p>\n<p>1. sound and animation</p>\n<p>2. creatures moving around, wizard drops potions</p>\n<p>3.
