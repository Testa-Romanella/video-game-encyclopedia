But the solution is not always simple.\u00a0 You will have to be clever and think out of the box sometimes to get the perfect score.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You can play in local co-op or move both robots alone.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Move: WASD (blue); Arrow Keys (orange)</p>\n<p>Push: E (blue); Right shift (orange)</p>\n<p>Restart level: R</p>\n<p>Next Level: Enter</p>\n<p>Back to Menu: Escape</p>\n\n<p>I won't work further on this game for now but will probably\u00a0return to it some day.
