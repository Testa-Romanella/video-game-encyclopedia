(with an optional mode to play without randomization)<br/><br/>While your quest will be extremely challenging, there are a wide variety of unlockable character upgrades to supplement the extensive level of customization provided to the player character. Should you lose all three of your starting Lives, your Soul will live on with the ability to carry over unlocked upgrades to the next save file.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>8-bit retro graphics and chiptune soundtrack<br/></li><li>In-depth character customization<br/></li><li>Unlockable upgrades<br/></li><li>Achievements<br/></li><li>Player choice affects the outcome of more than just battles<br/></li><li>Lives system enables players to become more powerful after being defeated<br/></li><li>Randomized gameplay for incredible replay value<br/></li><li>3 challenging Chapters spanning a broad range of environments<br/></li><li>A vast bestiary featuring 150+ monsters<br/></li><li>3 secret levels<br/></li><li>Multiple endings</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T03:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b39524017db55c89b738e8893b37fd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mooglerampage", "Runelight Owl"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Runelight Owl"], "esrb_rating": null}
