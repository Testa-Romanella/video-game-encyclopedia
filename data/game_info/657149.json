There was a choice of 10,000 fake games but Wolf Tower won me over with its simplistic (but challenging) look and limited color palette.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Essentially the controls are point &amp; click. Manage your turns &amp; make sure you survive &amp; enjoy the story in this classic commodore64 style game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Extract the .rar or.zip file using WinRar (its free) &amp; launch the Wolf Tower.exe to play<br/></p>\n\n<p>The best &amp; easiest way to access my games &amp; other creations are to become a member on Patreon.
