{"id": 561092, "slug": "northbound-lev", "name": "Northbound (Lev)", "name_original": "Northbound (Lev)", "description": "<p><strong>-Overview-</strong></p>\n<p>Northbound is a linear, story-driven classic JRPG adventure made for the (You)RPGM GameJam #2. I\u2019ve tried something different map-wise, every map is 1920x1080 (40x22 tiles) and I forced myself to never exceed this limit. I\u2019ve used mainly stock resources but I added some Yanfly scripts and some custom overlay from other projects I\u2019m working on at the moment.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a simple turn-based RPG with a story inspired by nordic mythology where three unusual warriors will have to team up to reach the top of the sacred mountains and battle to retrieve an ancient relic with the power to save or destroy the world.</p>\n<p>As I am working on another great project, also centered on the story, any comment or criticism of the dialogue will be greatly appreciated.\u00a0Anyway, it felt good working on something else for a while, thanks to who hosted the jam, I've had so much fun working on this project and it was nice going back to the basics with rpg maker default tilesets.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>-Story-</strong></p>\n<p>The sacred fountain was dry for almost a thousand years. No one could ever imagine that it would recover some day. Legends say that whoever will drink that water will see any wish granted. Explore a magic forest filled with monsters, ancient ruins, abandoned mines and secret dungeons to reach the infamous sacred mountain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Font<br/>https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-free</p>\n<p>Mountain Image Pixel Art<br/>\u00a0https://vnitti.itch.io/glacial-mountains-parallax-background</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T04:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/717/717137b1c8076e39f86edbd1f8b8b85d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
