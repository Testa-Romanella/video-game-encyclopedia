{"id": 112631, "slug": "royalty-free", "name": "Royalty Free", "name_original": "Royalty Free", "description": "<p>You are a young boy who just got hired to be on the royal guard. You meet five princesses, all with unique personalities, quirks, and interests. Things are going well, and he slowly falls in love with one of them.</p>\n<p>But as he finds out, princesses have their own problems to deal with, too.</p>\n\n<p>This is more an open beta than a fully released \"game\". A lot will still be subject to change, which means I <em>really</em> need feedback, because no one has seen these parts of the game yet besides me, and I know a lot of it is flawed (like both of Hinata's endings, so expect those to probably get rewritten).</p>\n\n<p>If you want to play this in a Let's Play on YouTube or a stream on Twitch, please feel free! Just make sure you link to this page in the description/chat so that others can see! If you could link me to the stream/video, that'd be great! I'd love to see what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f2/7f2c678e2ddf8eed26d45798956072cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Emily L"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
