The full game is still a work in progress.</strong></p>\n<p>Death. It is a natural occurrence. Everyone will experience it at one point. What happens after that, however, is a mystery. Maybe an afterlife awaits us. Maybe there are a plethora of Gods that await us. Maybe it is just a inky black void of nothingness.</p>\n<p>Well, this game shows us what lies after. Dive in to the story of a young unnamed girl, one who has recently died. She is to discover what lies after death. She is sent to the Lost Realm, a dimension where the souls of the dead are sent. Here, she is assigned the role of a Revenant, a soul that is sent to the Material Plane to do the Lady of The Lost Realm's bidding. Will she be ready to take on the role of a Revenant? What will she do? What kind of hi jinks and shenanigans will she be caught up in?\u00a0 Maybe she'll have to slay a party of Soul Shredders. Maybe stop an arcane cultist from bringing the destruction of Earth. Who knows what she'll have to do, but remember: Revenants are only sent out if something MAJOR is happening, so whatever it is, it will be AMAZING!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/caf4a961ad5af269a95d8bbb9fb2d6f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vendetta-Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
