It has 3 play options: Chill, Easy, and Fast.</p>\n<p>- Chill gives you 5 minutes of playtime and as long as you need for a word.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Easy gives you 30 seconds per word, and every 1 minute, the level goes up.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Fast is similar to Easy, but you start with 15 seconds, and every 30 seconds the level goes up.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you run out of time before guessing the correct word, it falls into 1 one of the 7 drop rows below.\u00a0If all these slots are filled is game over.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, if you guess a word right, you get some extra time, have another go at one of these dropped words, and save it. Especially towards to end of the Easy and\u00a0Fast games, things can get very hectic. It is true test of your fast thinking, word recollection, and short-term memory.\r\n</p>\n<p>Enjoy.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T19:42:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/588/5880a72363d645061c2d34b6f3c7f34d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hbroek13"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
