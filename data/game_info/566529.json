{"id": 566529, "slug": "pesky-humans", "name": "Pesky Humans", "name_original": "Pesky Humans", "description": "Pesky Humans is a reverse Space Invaders, where those darn Humans are trying to colonize your newly discovered planet!  Can you hold them off until your people can arrive?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Humans come in four different classes of ship:  Colony, Frigate, Fighters, and Scouts.  Colony and Frigate ships will beam down bases while the Fighters and Scouts will work together to defend them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour targeting and weaponry is a little less advanced than the Humans, so you'll need to plan ahead, lead your targets, and defend your own nukes as you do your best to keep them off your planet!  The two edges you have are that you can hide in the magnetic poles of the planet and can instantly warp between the two, and you can buy the help of some raiders to come in and sow a little chaos to the battlefield.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPesky Humans is a single player, shoot-em-up game with multiple difficulty levels.  Each session plays out in roughly thirty-five minutes, assuming that you can survive that long.  Crystals earned during game play will allow you to upgrade various aspects of your ship or to hire bombers or raiders to help bring you back from defeat.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T03:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/435/435adb525bdd5ab279c90cb2dae7145a.jpg", "website": "http://www.peskyhumansthegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Serious Tangents"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Serious Tangents"], "esrb_rating": null}
