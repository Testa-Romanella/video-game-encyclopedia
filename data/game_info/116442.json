It is still in early alpha stage, and it will be released when it's ready. I'm planning to release it as Windows standalone, UWP for Windows 10 and Xbox One, and, if resources permit (i.e. if I can properly test it and make sure there are no bugs), Linux and macOS standalone. Story is yet to be determined, more enemies are yet to be made. I will be posting updates as the progress is made.</p>\n<p>Demo Day 20 build is up.</p><p>Demo Day 20 bugfix build is up. Fixed a bug where you could be killed during a dialogue.<br/></p>\n<p>An Xbox One or 360 controller is highly recommended for the game.</p>\n<p>SELECT BUTTON ON CONTROLLER QUITS THE GAME!!! Be careful with that.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/87442136b2c46567ab8a593244f4b61f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kr0s"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
