The day ends in 10 minutes. When the day ends, you and your kids have to survive the night in the igloo. <br/></p>\n<p>If the igloo is incomplete, it's going to get cold and you and your kids freeze to death.<br/></p>\n<p>Your results will be rated at the end!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How To:</strong></p>\n<p>When you are around a snowstack\u00a0 <strong>hit Space multiple times</strong> to dig and create a ice block</p>\n<p>Press Space in front of the ice block to drag it. Press Space again to drop it. You can drag up to 3 ice blocks. But take care, they slow you down!</p>\n<p>Drag the ice blocks in front of your igloo (or its designated space) and press Space to build it.<br/><strong><br/>Hints:<br/></strong><br/>Take care of black ice\u00a0 you may slip and loose your ice blocks!<br/>During the day the global temperature is rising. The isnow stacks, ice blocks and your igloo are melting!<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Of course there is never enough time to finish a game perfectly :) <br/>- Kids animation sometimes doesn't change to \"laying on the ground\" when they got eaten by an ice bear .</p>\n<p>- Statistics at the end of the game are a bit messed ab. The results are not always clear</p>\n<p>- Attacking controls are not always flawless\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T14:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebc6a7046c9eec4b43299bf4c8bc1d72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["virtualjourney"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
