You place blocks and are required to have quick reflexes, puzzle solving skills and nerves of steel.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Honestly, what to expect?</strong>\u00a0Well, CubicPanic is a DIY project by a single developer, so everything isn't as polished as someone might expect. It is a small indie game.\u00a0<br/><br/>Main features:</p>\n<ul><li>Over 30 single player levels</li><li>1 vs 1 local multiplayer (bragging rights included)</li><li>Genuine Coder Graphics</li><li>\"Asset flip\"- free content</li></ul>\n<p>On the single player game, your goal is to place blocks on the board while time and speed is of an essence. Place your block in such a way that you cover green cubes on the board before they reach the sweeper down at the bottom.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Compete against your cousin / sister / mortal enemy in a hectic run for bragging rights. Get points for covering green areas and avoid red ones. First one covering all the green on the board receives the legendary level bonus. How many levels does it take to totally humiliate your opponent?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game has been done as a solo project by a single developer. Almost all the graphics, music, programming, sound effects etc. have been done in the comfort of the developer's basement , so the developer is single-handedly responsible for all the heartache this game might inflict. By purchasing this game you support developer's and his friends' habit of bathing and consuming beverages.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/877/8773f59d0c2a3c312a3ae1692570baee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pophead"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
