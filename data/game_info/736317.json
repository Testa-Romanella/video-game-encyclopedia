{"id": 736317, "slug": "highway-acceleroid-booster", "name": "Highway Acceleroid Booster", "name_original": "Highway Acceleroid Booster", "description": "<p>Highway Acceleroid Booster is a GZDoom gameplay mod where you play as a robot girl that&#39;s part car and part super fighting robot. Armed primarily with mobility, a series of battle chips for extra combat data, and a variety of utensils installed into her gauntlets, she zips from place to place to gather additional combat data. And to help out wherever she&#39;s needed, admittedly. Helping feels nice.<br />\nInspired by Mega Man X, gameplay feel is a little bit more cartoony and high-tech than usual, with some pretty outlandish weapons doing some silly functions.. Designed to act as a complement for sci-fi/space-age mapsets, the gameplay mod acts as a direct contrast with High Noon Drifter. Rather than being very simple and low-tech, this mod is a little bit more complicated and hi-tech.<br />\nIf you&#39;ve been looking for a mod where you can play as a robot, android, gynoid, or you&#39;ve been looking for something to compliment Stardate 20X7, this might be up your alley.</p>\n<p>Note 1: Keep in mind that because of all the mobility options, it&#39;s extremely easy to sequence break even by accident! It&#39;s encouraged not to try this mod on a mapset you haven&#39;t already played, unless you&#39;re brave. If you get stuck, just hit Use Inventory.<br />\nNote 2: This mod was designed with GZDoom 3.4.1 in mind. Super-extended resolutions brought about by any further versions are probably going to make things look funny.<br />\nNote 3: Make sure your Sprint is bound! Same with Reload and/or Zoom. Grab walls by hitting Use in mid-air.</p>\n<p>FEATURES:<br />\n- All sorts of mobility tricks and abilities I could fit in! Double-jumping, dashing, wall-grabbing, wall-jumping, speed boosting, mantling, rocketjumping, mid-air rocketjumping, and more...<br />\n- A crazy amount of work for ensuring compatibility with situations found in Boom/Vanilla and most ZDoom mapsets! Well, ones that don&#39;t replace players/weapons, at least.<br />\n- Support for both rocketjumping maps with extreme mobility, platforming maps that require precise movement, and normal run-and-gun maps you&#39;d find with normal Doom shenanigans!<br />\n- 9 new weapons, each with a separate primary fire and alt-fire each for 18 different attacks! Technically there&#39;s a couple more weapons but phhbbttt<br />\n- Simple SNES-style aesthetic! Simple particle effects that won&#39;t clog your computer! Bit-crushed sounds that emphasize the crunch! 0% adherence to actual SNES authenticity!<br />\n- Cvars out the ass! It just wouldn&#39;t be a TerminusEst13 mod without a pants-shittingly overwhelming amount of options.<br />\n- A whole bunch of new and original graphics!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T03:14:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d58b35e9c08a38b3a8ecd13530d7d4.jpg", "website": "https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=66819", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
