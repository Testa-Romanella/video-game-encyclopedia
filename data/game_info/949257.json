There is plans for fighting mechanics, lots of quests and story-telling, being able to choose mates and have a meaningful relationship with them, choices that acutally affect story, in depth characters who you can choose your relationship with and so much more.</p>\n<p>This is just a teensy little baby demo compared to the entire project! The demo will probably be added onto more until I reach the full game, which since I'm putting so much time and effort into will probably cost a tiny bit of money (No more than 5 dollars), but I will\u00a0<em><strong>always</strong></em> have a free version with less content available!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T15:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/2499af3dfa0a534d1280300775df93d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SparkSpore Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
