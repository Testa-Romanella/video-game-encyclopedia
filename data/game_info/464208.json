Stealthily, you make your way to the control room. The many-tentacled alien being had just left the terminal unmanned, for presumably what looks like to be a ... toilet break? (let's not think about it too much now). It's now your turn to control what appears to be a keyboard... seems like there's some instructions coming through the terminal now...</p>\n<p>This is a physics-based game made for the GMTK game jam 2020. The theme was \"OUT OF CONTROL\" and the game\u00a0uses the entire keyboard as a control scheme.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Actually the game is pretty easy to control, but if you're looking for a challenge that is\u00a0more in-line with the\u00a0theme, try to achieve the <strong>best time possible</strong>! Remember, you can plan (and scan) ahead before starting your move. Only a tutorial level and a fuller level sadly (I ran out of time) but <em>have fun</em>!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT: I realize that the UI ended up being too small on high-res screens. Here's a link to a build which fixes the UI scaling, else I\u00a0feel sorry for your eyes!.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move, Enter to speed up the dialog, Spacebar to scan, Escape to restart,\u00a0and alphabet keys\u00a0on the keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Attributions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Font -\u00a0comfortaa</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0Quirky-Pretty-Beautiful-Synth arpeggios (Human Conditioning) by SoularFlair</p>\n<p>SFX - from Freesound</p>\n<p>Assets - UFO by me, everything else is from the Polygon asset pack (Simple\u00a0Town)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3c41cd1231b6b61824cb9b80e72aad3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["randomphantom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
