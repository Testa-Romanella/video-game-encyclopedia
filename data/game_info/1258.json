{"id": 1258, "slug": "counterspy", "name": "CounterSpy", "name_original": "CounterSpy", "description": "<p>CounterSpy is an indie stealth game developed by Dynamighty.</p>\n<p>The game is inspired by the 60s style spy movies such as the James Bond series or The Man from U.N.K.L.E. Set in the Cold War, the player controls a spy that infiltrates the military bases of rival countries. </p>\n<p>The game is a 2.5D side-scroller but the players are able to target their weapons in a three-dimensional space. The main objective is to prevent the enemy from launching nuclear missiles. The players have to be cautious as getting detected affects the DEFCON status of a country in which the player is at the moment. If the player gets detected too often, the country enforces DEFCON 1 and launches uses its nuclear weaponry. The players can abort the launch if they make it in time, which results in completion of the level. </p>\n<p>Throughout the levels, the players can collect intelligence, which serves as an in-game currency. Intel is spent to buy ammo, upgrade your weapons or buy new ones.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-20T19:30:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86b/86b4df751b6781cd460b7f784e042e5f.jpeg", "website": "http://www.dynamighty.com/#counterspy", "rating": 3.2, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 42, "owned": 1235, "beaten": 87, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 119, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 70, "ratings_count": 225, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 228, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PS Vita", "PlayStation 4", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "PlayStation Mobile", "Dynamighty"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "PlayStation Mobile"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
