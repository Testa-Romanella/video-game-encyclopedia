I originally added music better graphics and some flashy graphics &amp; graphical effects, but it all felt a bit ugly so I simplified it. It's just tic-tac-toe after all... It doesn't even have a CPU opponent--just pass-and-play local multiplayer with a friend. Sorry I wasn't able to submit something cool! Maybe next year! <br/></p>\n<p>This is a Game Boy (DMG) ROM that can be played in a GB emulator or on a real Game Boy. I'll try to add comments and re-release the source to help people who are curious about GB programming. If I have time, I might add some stuff like link cable support, Super Game Boy functionality, etc.--we'll see...<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Only the directional pad and A button are used. It should be self-explanatory.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:05:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f4/9f44dae530a1a04f7922472facdf8199.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cabbage"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
