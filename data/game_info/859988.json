{"id": 859988, "slug": "lost-games", "name": "Lost Games", "name_original": "Lost Games", "description": "<p>Emerging from a bunch of dusty old Spectrum tapes I finally located, this is the first batch of my half-decent games to be coaxed to load, digitised and made fit for download. After a lengthy 39 year hiatus, I think it's nicely fitting that the timing of their rediscovery coincides neatly with the ZX Spectrum's 40th anniversary.</p>\n<p>Although they didn't make the cut with the publishers at the time, I think these compiled BASIC 16K games were quite fun for the era, and I'm happy to offer them here as a budget download rather than see them fade away forever!</p>\n\n\r\nROBON II\r\n<p>Robon II is a fun little 16K blaster and the follow up to the commercially released Robon, also from 1983. It loads into the lower 16K RAM via the LOAD \"\" CODE command.</p>\n<p>Although it didn't make the cut with the publishers at the time, I thought this compiled BASIC game was actually quite fun with its multiple long, glowing lasers, atmospheric droning sounds and frantic gameplay.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Guide your player to destroy the Robon Army for points.</p>\n<p>More advanced players can skip the game's early waves by pressing 'M' on the menu screen to select their starting wave number</p>\r\nKeyboard\u00a0Controls \r\n<p>O - Left<br/>P - Right<br/>A - Up<br/>Z - Down<br/>M - Fire</p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>Although the game was originally destined for the 16K Spectrum, and only loads into the bottom 16K of RAM, it was developed on a 48K model and saved out from that environment back in 1983. Consequently, Robon II only runs on a 48K Spectrum. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately I don't have the source code so I can't recompile again it for the 16K machine, but I'm happy to release it knowing that most users either have the much more popular 48K model or are running via emulation, which can easily handle it.</p>\n<p>I made some small code modifications which allow the game to now respond to both Issue 3 and Issue 2 keyboards, and also to pause once the game loads, ensuring the loading screen is displayed for fast loads. There was no loading screen made at the time so I've prepared one in the style of my others from the same era.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nQOG\r\n<p>Qog is an interesting little 16K game that loads into the lower 16K RAM via the LOAD \"\" CODE command.</p>\n<p>It was written in compiled BASIC in 1983 and at the time I wondered if it might be a viable commercial release for the 16K Spectrum, though publishers thought otherwise!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Guide Qog to destroy the invading Yuj before they steal the 9 Kith from the centre of the screen.</p>\n<p>Note that the Yuj must WALK INTO the Energy Field to be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Up/Down controls have priority over Left/Right.</p>\n<p>Recharge Qog at the charging station at the top left of the screen when Energy Field Charge is low.</p>\r\nKeyboard\u00a0Controls \r\n<p>O - Left<br/>P - Right<br/>A - Up<br/>Z - Down<br/>M - Energy field</p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>Although the game was originally destined for the 16K Spectrum, and only loads into the bottom 16K of RAM, it was developed on a 48K model and saved out from that environment back in 1983. Consequently, Qog only runs on a 48K Spectrum. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately I don't have the source code so I can't recompile again it for the 16K machine, but I don't think this should be a problem as most users either have the much more popular 48K model or are running via emulation, which can easily handle it.</p>\n<p>I made some small code modifications which allow the game to respond to both Issue 3 and Issue 2 keyboards, and also to pause once the game loads, ensuring the loading screen is displayed for fast loads. I also modified a m/c routine to tone down the extreme flashing of the display during the game menu screen. The loading screen has been slightly modified from 1983.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nWEEDY\r\n<p>Weedy is an original 16K Spectrum game that loads into the lower 16K RAM via the LOAD \"\" CODE command.</p>\n<p>Weedy was written in compiled BASIC in 1983, and though it wasn't to be, I had hopes that it might be a viable commercial release for the 16K Spectrum at the time.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Weedy is tasked with keeping the garden wall in order.</p>\n<p>Guide Weedy to prevent the weeds from reaching the top of the wall.</p>\n<p>When Weedy's Weedkiller Powder runs out, move to the side of the screen to refill. Spiders and slugs make Weedy's task harder.</p>\n<p>If the weeds grow out of control, use the Super Weedkiller to blast everything at once!</p>\r\nKeyboard Controls \r\n<p>O - Left<br/>P - Right<br/>Z - Scatter Weedkiller Powder<br/>6-0 - Super Weedkiller</p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>Although the game was originally destined for the 16K Spectrum, and only loads into the bottom 16K of RAM, it was developed on a 48K model and saved out from that environment back in 1983.

Although it too didn't make the cut with the publishers at the time, I have now regained access to the source of this compiled BASIC game and have added a few features to boost its appeal.</p>\n<p>Use the LOAD \"\" command to load the game.</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Enter the Hyperzax arena and use your skill to repel the alien invasion before they steal all 9 space pods from the planet's surface. <br/></p>\n<p>Extra points are awarded for thwarting pod abductions and for shooting down satellites during their frequent overpasses.</p>\n<p>Bonus life awarded every 10,000 points earned. Bonus pod awarded every two waves completed.<br/></p>\n\r\nKeyboard Controls \r\n<p>1 - Left<br/>2 - Right<br/>9 - Thrust<br/>0 - Fire</p>\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>The game was originally intended for the 16K Spectrum. However, since I've regained access to the BASIC source, I was able to add extra features to boost its appeal, and have compiled it with Colt for the 48K Spectrum. </p>\n<p>Extra features include the new red aliens that can fire back, a satellite that makes regular appearances across the screen and drops missiles in later stages, a bonus life every 10,000 pts, and a bonus pod for every 2 waves completed. Fire button sensitivity has also been improved.</p>\n<p>I also made a loading screen to match the style of other games from this era.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T09:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bf/4bf791221ee5dfc2267b1ba258716eee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cosmium"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
