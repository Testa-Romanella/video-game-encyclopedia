Recently I salvaged it, removed some of the API crap I had to put in and make it run again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And I thought why not upload it here to preserve the little game in a place where it can actually by played by people (since I couldn't find it anywhere else anymore).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Click/touch left or right from the character to make it move. Click/tap above or below to change gravity direction. Collect all cupcakes to complete a level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T10:53:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/488/4888b8c73206584c0fcebd712bed9ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelRebirth"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
