I thought of it one day while watching ducks and turtles at a local pond.\r\n \r\n</p>\n<p>As ducks emerged from the water, their butts would wiggle back  and forth, seemingly independent of the rest of their bodies. If you've  ever seen a duck shake off some damp, you'll know what I mean. \r\n</p>\n<p>As  turtles sank deeper into the water, I noticed that their features faded  as their depths increased. Eventually, I could see only vague blobs  with stumpy limbs drifting in and out through patches of light.\r\n \r\n</p>\n<p>Shapes and light and motion are what I was watching that day at  the pond.  I thought might be fun to make a toy that lets a person draw  some shapes in order to watch them drift and shift and wiggle.  So  that's what Wiggle World does. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T07:16:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f82bd4880cdd1855527284b7effb783.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Colin Okay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
