The race is held outdoors in a wide open country. Can you keep control of the bike over various obstacles and finish the course as fast as you can? It's rather hard to overcome all the obstacles as you need to calculate both the time and speed. There is no jump button so it's all about the tilt and speed you take, keep control and work your way through all of these insane bike levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/896/8967c88f59698479bf90c2e542f18750.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Defei Yuan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Defei Yuan"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
