Starting with only meager funds and dogged perseverance, you will conduct an intelligence investigation of the President\u2019s circle of aides, advisors, and donors. Surveil targets, tap communications, set up honey traps. Build dossiers on powerful members of the Washington elite as you generate intelligence and gather evidence. <br/><br/>Work sources, follow leads, and serve search warrants to build the case against those who would harm democracy. When the time is right, begin to prosecute and remove people from the board before all three branches of the U.S. government fail. If you succeed in pulling out the roots of treason you may be able to save the country, but only if you can remove the final piece from power -- the President.<br/><br/>But beware -- powerful forces, both foreign and domestic, work against you. Trust no one. Survive. Find the truth.<br/><br/><ul><li>Is the President a Traitor? is a strategy management game based around people, resources, and time.<br/><br/></li><li>Allies, enemies, and everyone in between are randomly generated.
