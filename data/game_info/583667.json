He has help though from an unlikely source - but needs to use it wisely as every time he does he feels slightly weaker...<br/></p>\n<p>In Eerie Halls you navigate a procedurally generated dungeon to find your lost cat in a throwback to the dungeon crawlers of old. <br/></p>\n<p>Play by using the arrow keys or WASD, and then press H to get help to guide you to the exit of the dungeon. When in battle use the left key to hit the box on the left to do damage,\u00a0 the right key in the red box to block attacks and the back key to escape from battle when the slider is on the yellow box.<br/></p>\n<p>For some details on our journey in this game jam check out our blog here: https://eeriehalls.wordpress.com/<br/></p>\n\n<p>Blgdchap - coding</p>\n<p>LeanriM - art and coding</p>\n<p>RubyHellScream - blog and story</p>\n<p>FordAudioDesign\u00a0 - music</p>\n<p>LanceBunt - concep, logo and character portraits<br/></p>\n<p>Everything seems to work well in the dungeon, the only part that didn't get finished in the jam is the volume and difficulty sliders in options don't effect the game - we kind of forgot in the big rush to implement that part before submitting the game :(\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any comments are welcome and we will release an updated version after voting based on feedback from the community. The procedurally generates dungeon is currently 25x25 tiles big which makes it a fairly short game, but in future will tie that to the difficulty slider.</p>\n<p>Thank you for looking at our page :)</p><p>Monsters and animations were all sourced from the Unity Asset store from AmusedART:</p><p>https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/28394</p><p>Seamless textures also taken from the Unity Asset store.</p><p>All 2d art was made by us during the jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T00:09:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b845ba577e2167eb3481b70c74472987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blgdchap", "lancebunt", "RubyHellscream", "FordAudioDesign", "LeanriM"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
