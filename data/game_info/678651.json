You will score points on how large your population grows but also on how sustainable your town is at the end of your mandate. <br/><br/>In Tiny Town, the more you build, the more land you acquire. And the faster your population grows, the more time you are afforded. <br/>But be sure to balance-out your production, your population's needs and your world's natural resources. Because if your environment collapses, so may your townsfolk know deprivation and famine!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T03:43:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88c/88cd6aeda1685eaa8f4241dfa74ad0a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["6 Toad Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["6 Toad Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
