The theme was \"Lost and Found.\"\u00a0\u00a0 I interpreted that as a mad rush to get ready at the start of my day to get somewhere, where I forgot where I put my wallet,\u00a0 phone and other items from the night before.\u00a0<br/><br/>I made all of the sounds using things around my house and my voice. I used MS Paint /GIMP to\u00a0 create the base circle, square, triangle, and tiles.
