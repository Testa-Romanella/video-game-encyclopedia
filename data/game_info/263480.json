In fact, it's limited in many ways - it has a fixed 16 color palette, 32KB of memory, and a 128x128 screen resolution. That's the whole fun of it!<br/>(If you'd like to learn more, please visit https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)</p>\n<p>The first stage in this process was to create a simple 3D engine. I had to relearn some basics of linear algebra and research how 3D software renderers are implemented.
