To be clear, the only reason this game had any chance to exist in such a short time\u00a0was because I used the Unity Frameworks and Tools\u00a0that I've been developing over the past ~2 years. As far as I could see it's allowed to use frameworks in the jam and most of it is free for everyone to use on the asset store. Still, I wanted to mention it because building this from scratch in such a short time\u00a0would have been pure insanity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T17:28:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2b/c2b47b4b0374604b7c7541941fc25b61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Star Banner Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
