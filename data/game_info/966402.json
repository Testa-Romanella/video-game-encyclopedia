Can you master the skill of square farming and earn yourself a quadrangular harvest?<br/><br/>***HOW TO PLAY***<br/>Plant your weirdly shaped blocks of seeds somewhere in your big, square field. If you fill a row, column, or 3x3 square, the crop is harvested! Harvest multiple times at once, and your crops will be a better quality!<br/><br/>Farm your way through the year, and as you do, you'll unlock new crops, each with their own unique shape and values. Which four crops do you want to use today? Aim for your best score!<br/><br/>***VILLAGERS***<br/>Every once in a while, you will be visited by a local from the nearby town of Squarewood!<br/><br/>Give a villager one of the flowers you grow on your farm to further your friendship and move their unique story forward. Who will you make friends with first?<br/><br/>***FEATURES***<br/>-Upgrade your farm with new buildings! A barn? A stable? Or maybe it's time to fix that fence?<br/>-Buy tools to help you farm. A watering can, for example, will grow crops instantly, while fertilizer will double the crops grown!<br/>-Animals! Animals can be used to farm animal products instead of crops. They are a little fussier, but they earn good money!<br/>-Watch the season change as you progress through the year. Plant the right crop in the right season to earn bonuses.<br/>-Squarewood Town is just around the corner. Hop on your bike and give the village a visit!<br/>-Ad free!
