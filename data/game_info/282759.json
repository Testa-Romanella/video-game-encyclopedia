Fair difficulty, many levels, many\u00a0 mechanics. Controller it's highly recommended.</p>\n<p>The game is still in early access, the graphics and aesthetics of the game might or might not change a lot, there are still many mechanics that I'm testing and will create levels to introduce them. I am the difficulty to be medium and scale to hard. Music for the game is nearly done but I'm still thinking how to better integrate it. The character might remain a cube or a 3D character with animations for jumping, running, wallslideing, etc.</p>\n<p>What I will add for sure: More levels, more mechanics, a better character \"tail\", sounds, menu.</p>\n<p>What I will guarantee: If I'll be able to finish the game, if you will buy it, you will have the full game, no Paid DLC or ANY UNETHICAL money grabbing method.</p>\n<p>If you guys got any feedback I'd love to hear it on \" ioanastelian94@gmail.com \", I'd love to hear it that much so I'll give to most valuable contributors free game keys when the game will be done and polished.</p>\n<p>The final price of the game will probably be somewhere near 5 euros with the option to download it for free. Not a promise, it depends if I will team up with somebody and the level of the polish the game will have.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/16509cb4035c6ffcd618fecf4a92f82a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corangar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
