Great price,great gameplay.<br/><br/><br/>Meatball Marathon is a race to make the world a healthier place to live by saving people from eating junk food. <br/><br/>Being a superhero was Snacky G's dream. He was pretty passionate about saving people, but equally as passionate about junk food. That's where his dilemma came in. After much thought, he finally came up with a way: he'd take the two things that meant the most to him and bring them together in one beautiful combination. He hatched a brilliant plan to be the first superhero that would save the world from unhealthy junk food by eating it all himself! <br/><br/>Meatball Marathon features: <br/>* Fun gameplay <br/>* Easy to use controls <br/>* Fast-paced excitement <br/>* Customizable game levels <br/>* Online editor to creat and submit your own levels <br/><br/>Your mission is to assist Snacky in finding food by helping him leap buildings, jump over obstacles and eat as much food as possible. Keep in mind that Snacky G isn't your usual superhero. He's got a little more bulk and therefore requires more consideration and space before he goes jumping and leaping about. <br/><br/>Think you can create levels of your own to help Snacky G find more snacks and rid the world of junk food? GREAT! Download Meatball Marathon now, and help Snacky G help you live a healthier and longer life. <br/><br/>Better interface, more levels and more objects. <br/>Thank you for your support!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5f23662513197ce54b2a67d94ac943c.jpg", "website": "http://www.meatballmarathon.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ingenieria Digital Oviedo"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ingenieria Digital Oviedo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
