Wife, take the children... It seems that an ancient evil has awakened, a primal thirst for human flesh and an irresistible desire to swallow the whole world is already close. Demons and Dinodragons, Giants and Ogres - they all stand in our way to a peaceful life. But only three warriors, whose valor allows them to fight, rose to defend the village.</p>\n<p>R\u014dnin is a once glorious stench that has lost its master, but not lost its honor. He is fast and strong, but the lack of armor makes itself felt.</p>\n<p>Ky\u016bdo is a brave archer whose arrow is capable of striking even the most cautious enemy. Prefers ranged attacks to melee attacks.</p>\n<p>S\u016bmo is the kindest of them all. Thanks to its strength, it is able to destroy a whole squad of villains at once.</p>\n<p>Gather your warriors and fight off the forces of darkness!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T04:45:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99f75e813d8734ea24664d7ab5216f13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["koro.games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
