We borrowed assets for physics from the unity store and had an additional package for text (TextMesh PRO) that we did not make ourselves.<br/></p>\n<p>==================================<br/></p>\n<p>Theme: Return</p>\n<p>Reverse Metroidvania:</p>\n<p>You will be losing power as one passes through the same level. Power ideas: stun enemies when facing them, insta kill, dash etc. Fights the same boss at the end of the level, when level is complete choose a power to lose and boss gains the power, return to the start of the level again.</p>\n<p>Lore: Cat has become all mighty and powerful, it has not returned to fight and give back its power.<br/></p>\n<p>Moral: Don't overwork! Take rest!</p>\n<p>Returning to work after being in quarantine for ever and now you don\u2019t have any social skills left, you maybe don\u2019t like your job anymore and want to go on strike, challenge your working conditions because now you realize how much better it can be.<br/></p>\n<p>My teammates and I created a video game and composed a soundtrack in just 48 hours for a charity game jam!
