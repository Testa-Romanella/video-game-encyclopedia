Its housing is yellow, the screen shows an empty road across a green field below a blue sky. The battery is in a good shape, they say. There is a left and right button on it. You press START.</p>\n<p>FEATURES</p>\n<p>========</p>\n<p>- LCD game simulation</p>\n<p>- beautiful multi-color scenery</p>\n<p>- controllable via left and right buttons</p>\n<p>- lame like a (cheap) real one</p>\n<p>- a truly disposable software</p>\n<p>- battery included</p>\n<p>- It has sounds!</p>\n\n<p>GAME INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p>=================</p>\n<p>Your car is placed on a road, on which your car is moving, even if you don't notice that. There are other cars coming down on this road, and you must avoid them using your cursor LEFT and RIGHT buttons. You can only drive either on the left or the right side. Note that other cars beside yours look like just yours, the only difference is that your driver and a passenger are visible. If you crash into another car, a crash sound plays and some flying particles are visible for a short time. The game goes on anyway. Note that the battery lasts around 2 minutes, after that you must dispose of your game.</p>\n\n<p>PROGRAM LINES OVERVIEW</p>\n<p>======================</p>\n<p>Use the LIST command to view the program lines. You can use the LIST from-to syntax to list certain intervals, eg.
