In Trash Panda, you play as both Ricky and Box Man, fighting off the Mouse King's henchmen and eventually fighting off the Mouse King himself to save the park from his terrible rule! <br/><br/>\"Trash Panda: The Adventures of Ricky and Box Man\" is a <strong>2D side-scrolling, platformer, shooter</strong> in which Ricky has the ability to use WASD to move left, right, and jump, as well as the left mouse click to throw trash at enemies. Sometimes Ricky needs the help of Box Man to get him to higher places. Unfortunately our box friend has a fear of heights, so he can only use the left and right arrow keys to move side to side. When E is pressed, it teleports Box Man to Ricky's current location. With these controls, the duo is unstoppable! Join Ricky and Box Man as they <strong>adventure</strong> through the park to defeat the evil Mouse King!<br/><br/>Keyboard and Mouse Supported.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T03:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c88d7a7ea28e32ac4616ef1d3b9e5cb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ky McLeod", "Alex Ibarra", "Caleb Myers"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["DET@ACU", "Sizzlin' Siesta Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
