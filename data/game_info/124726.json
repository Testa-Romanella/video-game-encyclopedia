Every 50 kills will be awarded with $500. The game is the author's first attempt at making a computer game and is extended from a tutorial series at\u00a0www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys.</p>\n<p>The game was initially intended to share with friends and family. Now I\u00a0would love to make it even\u00a0more enjoyable with your feedback and\u00a0suggestion to extend/change/re-balance the game, e.g. camera shakes. This is a small project that I\u00a0did in one week so there is a lot of room for improvement.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5df/5df9d970235a3ed166f3646b678ef8bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nam Nguyen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
