This is concept demo of what that could be.</p>\n<p><strong>Submission for Retro Jam 2021</strong></p>\n<p>The idea was to integrate the theme of the jam, \"side effect\", into the game in the form of resource management. Cutting down all bushes gives you sticks, which you can use to build things, but then you also need to build other things and so you would need to reuse the materials from built stuff in some way.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I sadly didn't have time to finish this game, so the player is merely a debug mesh. I was going for the look of the beta footage of \"Zelda 64\" from\u00a0Nintendo Space World\u00a0of 1995.</em></p>\n\n<p>https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Development_of_The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_...</p>\n<p><strong>Keys</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD for movement.</li><li>J for \"B\"</li><li>K for \"A\"</li><li>L for \"C down\"</li></ul>\n<p>Or if you happen to have a retro-bit N64 USB controller that'll work too!</p>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Bridge from @devilsworkshop -\u00a0https://devilsworkshop.itch.io/low-poly-3d-and-pixel-2d-rpg-game-assets</p>\n<p>Trees and fences from @devilsworkshop -\u00a0https://devilsworkshop.itch.io/lowpoly-forest-pack</p>\n<p>Stick sprite from\u00a0The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time (\u00a9Nintendo) ripped by GaryCXJk -\u00a0https://www.spriters-resource.com/nintendo_64/thelegendofzeldaocarinaoftime/shee...</p>\n<p>Ground textures from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time (\u00a9Nintendo) ripped by BIOHAZARD -\u00a0https://www.textures-resource.com/nintendo_64/legendofzeldaocarinaoftime/texture...</p>\n<p>Button sprites from Donkey Kong 64 (\u00a9Nintendo) ripped by Mr. C -\u00a0https://www.spriters-resource.com/nintendo_64/donkeykong64/sheet/40217/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b1/5b12b579c71f4e0ee570cf01cf9a129b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["johnbrynte"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
