Something fishy is going on with which way is down...<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>A and D to move left and right, Space to jump (hold for higher jump).<br/>Click and hold to shoot a hook, release the mouse to release the hook.<br/>You can jump to disconnect from the hook, or once in mid-air after you have released it.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game jam, so I'm super interested in hearing feedback from y'all! I hope it was an interesting concept. I hope it's about the right level of difficulty and it's not too hard to learn.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T03:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/414414b122ff4e1738b2b44a42ae515f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["steampunc"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
