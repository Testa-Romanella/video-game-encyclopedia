In this jam version, only one class of abilities exist, rage  abilities. There are 4 more ability classes planned, but time ran short  to implement them.<br/></p>\r\nThis game has a game breaking bug. While it is technically able to be played and even completed with some difficulty, you will not be able to use the entire main mechanic of the game. If you would like to play it as intended, the fixed version is at the page below:<p>(The fix was made less than 10 minutes after the end of the jam. It is not a post-jam version with extra features and content. It is the exact same game just fixed)<br/></p>\r\n\u00a0https://standoffsoftware.itch.io/amelia-vs-the-goblin-mafia-1", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T06:39:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc8/dc82486078f28dd6f1fe0f0422ebf8f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StandOffSoftware"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
