In that case, you'll be thrown into the opposite direction of your attack. Use this to clear canyons, make your way up walls and cover big distances. This is very early stuff, so there are no sound effects. I would still love to know wether you think the controls work well, wether the level design could be improved, or if you have something to critique in the art department. But don't get me wrong, this demo should still be fun, even\u00a0though\u00a0you\u00a0might\u00a0encounter\u00a0a\u00a0bug. If you do, tell\u00a0me\u00a0all\u00a0about\u00a0it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T06:26:50", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grafond"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
