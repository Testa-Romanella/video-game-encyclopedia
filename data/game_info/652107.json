The whole point is to get combos to shoot out supers. 10 direct hits at the boss (without any other bullets not hitting the boss) will give you a super with a lot of damage and will destroy all raindrops on screen. This is a not very polished game sadly because I placed a deadline on myself and because there was school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Arrows or WASD to move and Z to shoot out normal bullets. X to do a super.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming and (a bit of) Art: Takago</p>\n<p>Art and (first time to make) Music: Miyaki\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:38:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44c/44c3197eb49503276737e19fc79b0add.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
