You cannot save during a quest.</p><p>Disclaimer: Rage Mage was my first proper game I ever developed. It is very basic and short and it was mainly meant to be a learning experience for me. Don't expect this to be your newest addiction, or to be the next greatest game of the year. But thanks to all the nice feedback, it's been great :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/724b859735534ff144b144f5318273eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Blizzard Muffin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
