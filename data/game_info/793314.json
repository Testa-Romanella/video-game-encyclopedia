The theme was permanence.</p>\n<p>Solarpunk Mei is about bringing life back to your home. As trash falls from the wealthy space colony above, collect and use it to craft items and upgrades to clean up the pollution long plaguing the planet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We used trash and pollution to target the theme. The trash and pollution we create has to end up somewhere on the Earth. Even if we don't see it in the short term, it builds up in the long term due to it's permanence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrow keys to move</li><li>Left click and hold to drag items</li><li>Scroll wheel rotates the screen</li></ul>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Not all items can be combined and the trash item can only be burned.</li><li>Drops are random so sometimes there are long stretches where you don't get items that will combine together. Fire and patience are your friends here.</li><li>Don't be afraid to throw useful items into the fire so trash does not build up. You will lose progress but it's better than losing the game :)</li><li>You can throw crafted items onto the houses.</li></ul>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>New Growth by gurdonark (c) copyright 2022 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial\u00a0 (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/gurdonark/64759 Ft: Duckett\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71d/71d3bde1c2f9aa607c87a282a322eb5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["C4Scar", "kiko1135"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
