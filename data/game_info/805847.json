This project was originally for school, yet, I went a bit above and beyond. I started working on it five months ago, although not much progress has happened in the past few weeks, therefore, I thought I might as well publish it on Itch before I lose all interest in developing it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I haven't had the time to watch a new player play it from start to finish so I can't give a solid estimate on the play time but I would assume from what I've seen so far that it should take about an hour. The game automatically saves so no worries if you can not play for that long in one sitting. I can personally beat the game in a few minutes so speedrunning is a real possibility. The game is designed to be difficult and unforgiving (i.e. you can fall halfway back to the beginning).</p><p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T18:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a9a8891a8c5f8cb90450e392a1518cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DenneMan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
