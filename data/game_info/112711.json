You play as a mysterious hero with a mysterious past and even more mysterious anatomy, and you must jump of the heads of bees. Where do they go when they fall? Who knows? It's up to you. (Technically speaking, the instance of the bee is removed when it falls out of sight.)</p><p>This game was programmed by Sam in GameMaker, and the art, concepts, and everything else was done by Jeff. (Apart from the sound and some concepts, which were by Sam. Apart from the music and some of the other concepts, which were by Jeff.)</p><p><strong>Enjoy the bees.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67b/67b5e87be412488c238533d5bd9263c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kat Pokesie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
