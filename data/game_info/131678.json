However, several days later, the poem still stuck in my mind in its entirety; I still have no idea why, as I still don\u2019t think the words particularly mean anything together, but there was something there so I aimed to capture a bit of that vague but interesting mystery in exploring abstract aesthetics. Which is really just a roundabout way of saying I just wanted to make cool looking places.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Wander around and explore. If something sticks out it\u2019s probably a distraction, and if something feels rather empty there\u2019s probably something there. 2 of the 4 levels have a secondary secret(-ish) method of progressing. A disproportionate amount of work went into them instead of silly things like the overall game\u2019s actual quality or cohesiveness (or sound (I'll fix that in a later update)) so please find them.</p>\n\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<p>Currently there's a bug with the Winter level's rendering. Shadows don't seem to exist.</p>\n\n<p>4 Seasons from Steven Fan on Vimeo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/caf63d7b1d61edb995c4f8d9b9ee53ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Syf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
