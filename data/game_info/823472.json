The main part to win the game is to block out\u00a0 ways of other players and bots in the game. It's important to not collide with other obstacles and objects.

It has it's own initial speed and in different levels speed of object is different. When it collides with another object, it explodes and the player loses game.</p>\n<p>-&gt;\"SpeedIncreaser\".This object gives opportunity to increase the speed of \"Snakie\" and make tricks. It's very useful for overtaking bot or the other player and block the way. The skill will be active for 5 seconds after taking it.</p>\n<p>-&gt;\"SpeedDecreaser\".After taking this object \"Snakie\" becomes slower. It's useful in small world, when speed is so fast and space is small. It becomes easier to go trough holes when the speed is smaller.

Basically, the Left Arrow and Right Arrow buttons are preferred to control the game. It differs only in the \"Play With Friends\" levels, where players can use the same computer to play together. There you can use \"A\", \"B\", \"Left Arrow\" to turn the \"Snake\" to the left, and \"D\", \"M\", \"Right Arrow\" to turn the \"Snake\" to the right. When playing with 4 players, you can also use a computer mouse.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T23:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9cd087a9fd1711ad37e78331b19113e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ehyoZamon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
