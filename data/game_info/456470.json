You are a simple circle in the mind! And you MUST stop your person from getting depression! This was made for the GameDev\u00a0Hideout #1,\u00a0 and relates to the theme of Black and White in a few ways:</p>\n<p>1. It's mostly black and white (because I couldn't find any nice colors)</p>\n<p>2. You want to see light, not darkness, the darkness is depression, since they only see the world badly, and the light is happiness!</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS -</p>\n<p>W - up</p>\n<p>A - left</p>\n<p>S - down</p>\n<p>D - right</p>\n<p>Mouse - Aim</p>\n<p>Left\u00a0Click - Shoot</p>\n\n<p>The more depression squares you kill, the more points you earn!
