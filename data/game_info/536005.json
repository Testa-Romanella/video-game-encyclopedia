Zoom out to play the game.<br/><br/>A couple of months ago I\u00a0streamed myself making 6 games in 12 hours, which of one game\u00a0was the start of this project. After that I procrastinated for 4 months, until finally deciding to spend a few days on this to finish it. Unfortunately I\u00a0have 0 artistic sense, and my music is horrible, so I decided to not spend time on adding either of those to the game.<br/><br/>That said, it's a fun 3 minute experience, with some jokes you might recognize if you watch dani's videos on youtube (wishlist Karlson), and I urge you to try using the different \"attacks\"\u00a0multiple times to see what changes.\u00a0<br/><br/>Credits\u00a0(I think I took some stuff from danis thumbnails too that's not listed)</p>\n<p>Return arrow by Kokota, for thenounproject.com<br/>    thenounproject: https://thenounproject.com/icon/2385417/<br/>    Karlson Vibe music by Evan King<br/>    Youtube: </p>\n<p> Spotify: https://spoti.fi/35SpOWd<br/> Bandcamp: https://evanking.bandcamp.com/album/karlson-vibe-milkman-karlson-theme<br/>Karlson Vibe video by Dani<br/> Youtube: <br/></p>\n<p> Wishlist Karlson: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228610/KARLSON/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aad7e3fe988c228307ea83b9e9143b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ITR"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
