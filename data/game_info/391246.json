He\u2019s famous for his ability to solve crimes, unravel any mystery and catch even the smartest villains, but things are about to change really soon. That\u2019s where the story begins. Can one failure determine your future? Can you really escape from your past or at some point in time it\u2019s bound to come back to haunt you?<br/>Or maybe... every decision you\u2019ve ever made wasn\u2019t yours in the first place? What if you\u2019re just a pawn used for greater things to come?<br/><br/>In the game you\u2019ll play the role of a detective. Help your hero make his way to find purpose again. Of course, there\u2019s a possibility to meet quite a lot of beautiful women. How will you treat them? In a gentleman fashion or maybe use them for your gains? Be careful! Each decision can impact your character\u2019s future. You decide if you want to become the hero or the villain.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>My Two Cents:</strong><br/>I\u2019d love Deliverance to be more story and character-oriented, where every person appearing (more often) on the screen has a motivation, purpose \u2013 a character arc.<br/><br/>The story's planned out more or less from beginning to end, so I know where I'm heading. The game will definitely not be abandoned, simply because it's my dream to finish the project. One important thing to notice is that I treat it seriously: I invested in a powerful PC, tons of assets and I'm willing to spend every minute of my free time to work on it.\u00a0<br/>The game in later chapters gets big and I mean BIG. To keep it exactly as I planned I'm going to need even more models, kitbashes and assets in general, so any help is appreciated and keeps my motivation flying high!<br/><br/>Please consider visiting my Patreon\u00a0page.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce37674982c2c88b8e24eb5721024666.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["1Thousand"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
