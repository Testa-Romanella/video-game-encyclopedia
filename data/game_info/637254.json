He can make move using \"A\" and \"D\" and jump using \"W\". He can also shoot bubbles when you hit space. Bubbles can make Lucky fly for 2 seconds before popping, however, each bubble costs him one of his 9 lives. He can also shoot bubbles at his enemies, the Jack-O-Lanterns to make them fly for two seconds but BEWARE! Moving Jack-O-Lanterns are immune to bubbles. At the end of each level, Lucky refills on his bubble liquid and gets his 9 lives back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:08:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c8/3c8774b28f3f498630ab000d9ecf422f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cactus_cat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
