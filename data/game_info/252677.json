These features are subtle manipulations of the aesthetic of the Sublime (Vastness, Infinity, Succession, Uniformity) all building to create an evocative journey for the user. The physical qualities of the built objects are influenced by religious architecture but do not borrow from any single aesthetic, instead affecting the audience through their form and scale rather than relying on\u00a0 pre-established cultural understandings.</p>\n<p><em>Firmament is designed to be experienced through the Oculus Rift VR Headset but can also be played through traditional PC Controls, also supporting Xbox Controls.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/143/14361e1c5641750cae9921d312d1b6be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucian R Lovell"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
