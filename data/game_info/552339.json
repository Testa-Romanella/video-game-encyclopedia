You must reach the finish flag to go to the next level.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>This arcade game with simple but difficult mechanics was developed for Blackthornprod Game Jam # 3, which established a period of 1 week to complete the project. As I am very clueless I discovered the event a little late so I really only had 4 days to finish it, I wish I had done the best I could.<br/></p>\n\n<p>You can turn the ship using the <strong>DIRECTIONAL ARROWS</strong> or the <strong>A / D</strong> keys.</p>\n<p>To control the ship, it is very simple, press\u00a0<strong>SPACE\u00a0</strong>or\u00a0<strong>W</strong>\u00a0to start the engines... Be careful! The\u00a0<strong>LESS\u00a0</strong>fuel you have, the\u00a0<strong>MORE\u00a0</strong>speed you get.<br/></p>\n<p>_________________________________________</p>\n<p>The levels are very short, but you have to be careful and explore the map to find the best route... You know what? If you want to <strong>speedrun </strong>the game, you would make me very happy. I want to see how long it can take someone who masters the game.<br/></p>\n<p>I will be glad to receive your comments and feedback, this is my first game released in this year and I was looking forward to working on such a project.</p>\n<p><em>The game is available in English, Spanish, German and Esperanto.</em><br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Programming, Art and Music by StivArts (me)</p>\n<p>Monogram font by datagoblin</p>\n<p>Made with Unity 2019.4 LTS</p>\r\nF.A.Q.\r\n<strong>Why do the rocket goes faster?</strong>\n<p><em>Because when the fuel runs out, the weight of the ship is also reduced.
