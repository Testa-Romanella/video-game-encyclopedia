In lieu of oil, our astronaut must collect trash to fuel his ship, while avoiding obstacles and drones. Trashtronaut is a side-scrolling, resource-collection game in which you must collect soda cans, banana peels, and old tires to take back to your ship before the level's time runs out. Collect power-ups to improve your time/abilities. Some trash is worth more fuel than others!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/586/586de849b1e0921896cf7399a3ad6e89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AmericanWonton"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
