They used to be close and now they need to remember the tight bond they used to have.</p>\n<p>In their memories, Toby is a little rascal who never runs out of ideas. He is as brave as a knight, as long as big sister Mindy is the one scouting the road ahead. His \"helmet\", a red bucket, protects him from the darkness and shadows.  Mindy is a sweet and imaginative little lady who's strength you could compare to that of a tiger. She is always carrying her little cat plushie around as a guardian angel. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/77379c473339ed419353166625a4ba4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juvenext"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
