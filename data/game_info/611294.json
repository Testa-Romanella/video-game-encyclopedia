You will have to control of a player and can move laterally left and right. The player will run forward automatically with time. Holding up a button will allow the player to start jumping. Letting go will cause the jump to settle as one would expect it to. The user will try to dodge obstacles or jump on top of obstacles to avoid them. Hitting a wall or falling off the track will cause you to lose and have to start over. In the background and on the sides of the track will be textures and colors doing a wave like animation to try and give the game an aurora or techie feel. There will be some sort of techie music playing also.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T08:07:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c57/c57f3b955780ef6f297254e9640d11a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Muhammad Ali Developer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
