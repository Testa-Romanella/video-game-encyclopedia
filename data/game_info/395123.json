The game features a rotating main area, to represent the ring that needs to be traversed. There is a demon that can float through the ring to attack the soul as well.<br/><br/>To succeed, the soul needs to get through the maze on each ring, avoiding enemies and traps, and venture through the portal at the end of each maze.\u00a0This will take them to the next level up, until they escape into limbo.</p>\n<p>==========================================================<br/>Credits: TEAM INSOMNIA<br/>==========================================================<br/>Joshua \"JDSherbert\" Herbert:<br/>\u00a0- Lead Artist, Textures, Models, UI, Lighting, Particles, Music, MainMenu, Co-leader</p>\n<p>Martin \"Jimbob\" Beockett:<br/>- Lead Programmer, Mechanics, Enemy AI, Level Design,\u00a0Co-leader<br/><br/>__________________________OTHER ROLES_________________________________________<br/>George \"PK\" Allmark:<br/>\u00a0- Narrative and thematics<br/>Blighted Iris:<br/>\u00a0- Sound Effects and Sound Samples<br/>James England:<br/>\u00a0- Support and Quartermaster</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T04:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be0/be00c365f45e9c95fd5e4b0da2a7aaf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JDSherbert"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
