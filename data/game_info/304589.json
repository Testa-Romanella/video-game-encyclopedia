Most of the levels are designed around a photograph and then made to be audio-reactive. The game doesn't have many formal structures or defined mechanics it is more of an experience.\u00a0\u00a0The art in the game is made from found photographs from circa 1960-1980 South Africa. This was a tumultuous period in South\u00a0Africa's history.\u00a0Some of the photographs and resulting levels are distortions of figures from a secret police counter-insurgency\u00a0unit called \"Koevoet\"~ crowbar. The brutality and tragedy of Apartheid\u00a0are distorted and disseminated in this artistic series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-29T04:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0de/0de52dedb1797be53c33567f36547699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digidevolution"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
