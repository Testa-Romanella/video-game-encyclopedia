How wrong he was. Aleric the Craven, a once-respected Coven Alchemist, has fallen to madness and corruption. With dreams of curing death, he has subverted the natural cycle and succeeded in bringing about a local apocalypse. He flees across the desert to an ancient cathedral dedicated to the memory of a long-dead god. The Inquisitors follow.
