The alien ships will come in waves form top or bottom of the screen at the rhythm of the music. After each level you can upgrade some stats using your score points as credits, but these will be deducted form the final score! There are only 3 levels, average playtime is 8 minutes. Enjoy!</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>I started this project as a personal prototype while I was learning to use Unity following a tutorials on www.GameDev.tv<br/>I decided to\u00a0continue developing the game as a School Project, add my own features without looking at a sept by step guide. I used books like\u00a0Game Programming Patterns\u00a0and\u00a0Unity Game Development Cookbook: Essentials for Every Game.</p>\n<p>The 2D assets are from\u00a0Space Shooter Redux\u00a0on\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/</p>\n<p>The music I used was form Juhani Junkala</p>\n<p>This is his game music portfolio: </p>\n<p>This is his contact information: juhani.junkala@musician.org<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to my Professor <strong>William Hendrix\u00a0</strong>for the mentorship, feedback and ideas.
