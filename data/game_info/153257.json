In this game, there are no zombies or monsters, just different puzzles of variable complexity.<br/>\r\nOur goal with Fade Out is to experiment with this gaming genre and to bring an escape room to the player's living room.<br/>\r\nFade Out is a single player virtual reality game, available for HTC Vive and will be supporting Oculus Rift later on.<br/>\r\nIf your actual room is small, or if you prefer playing the game sitting on the sofa, you can use the built-in teleport system. The game is violence-free and although it is based in unsetting environments, it can be played by gamers of any age.<br/>\r\nFade Out is created by a very small and multicultural team from different countries (5 countries for 10 people).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98d/98d9b89c13e3fcbf43ee8ddfa87e5f1d.jpg", "website": "http://www.fadeoutgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["karpopper", "PlaySys"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["PlaySys"], "esrb_rating": null}
