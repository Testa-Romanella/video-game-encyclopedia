Haven't got the occasion to polish those because of time limitation.</p>\n<p>Suggestions and criticisms are always welcome :D</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bugs</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is full of them, and I couldn't patch them all because of time limitation. I hope you will be able to enjoy the game anyways :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T08:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7be/7bebf356cd044bc9f46587219735f5b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Distru121"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
