Luckily there are some techniques that focus on recreating a dream-experience!\r\n<br/><br/>Somnior: Dream-Simulation is an experimental, surreal artgame, which aims to convey the 'Dream-experience' through the following 3 methods:<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>1.)\u00a0<strong>Simulation</strong>: The 'dream' is explicitly represented and mimiced. The game was developed with a dream-diary in mind!\r\n</p>\n<p>2.)\u00a0<strong>Surrealism</strong>: Most content is randomly generated, at least to some degree, and has no apparent sense, going so far as being incoherent and illogical in nature\u00a0- giving you plenty of space to create your own meaning!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>3.)\u00a0<strong>Daydreaming</strong>: Multiple aspects of the game encourage the usage of the player's imagination - trying to inspire an individual fiction.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>______________________________________\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This game was created at the\u00a0Game Design // UE\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Europe for Applied Sciences.<br/></p>\n\n<p>______________________________________<br/>Game by Leo S.</p>\n<p>Some third Party Assets used in the project from:<br/><br/></p>\n<p>- Textures.com (Textures)<br/>- AmbientCG (Textures)<br/>- Pexels.com (Textures)<br/>- PMSFX (Sound FX)<br/>- Musescore 3.6 (Fluid-R3 Soundfont)<br/>- Google fonts<br/><br/>List of used software can be found in the build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T08:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29b/29ba70502673feb01fec525571fee94a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\ud83c\udf80Birgit Plum\ud83d\udc80"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
