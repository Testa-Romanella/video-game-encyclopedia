But also in the centuries preceding and following that, they pioneered with their characteristic painting styles and emotional depictions on canvas. The power of paint, colors, brushes and spatulas, combined with the genius of the painters created a new world, elusive in between reality and abstraction. The Dutchman Johannes Vermeer conquered the world with one bright glance from the Girl with a Pearl Earring. This extraordinary painting has become an icon; the intense blue color of her headscarf is recognizable to anyone. The Mona Lisa, the most famous painting ever, was painted by Leonardo da Vinci and is on display in the Lourve in Paris. The faint smile on her face, painted so beautifully and with such precision, makes the Mona Lisa the most valued painting of all time. The genius Rembrandt van Rijn painted many self-portraits, and even the portraits he made of others reflect his own facial features. From enhancing goddesses painted in a drawing-like manner by Sandro Botticelli, to the sad faces by Titian and the emotional portraits by Frans Hals, some of the most beautiful portrait paintings have been collected for the Old Master Pairs.<br/><br/>Although the painters influenced and inspired each other, most paintings are immediately recognizable as distinctly coming from one of the old masters.
