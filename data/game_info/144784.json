Once the player's health drops low enough, the resolution will drop from 64x64 to 32x32 (the resolution will be 8x8 by the time the player dies).</p>\n<p>Also, the player's health decreases over time, and must be replenished by collecting coins. This, combined with the dynamic resolution, creates an element of challenge and brings a sense of panic as the player's vision deteriorates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89f/89f954b1b603ce8471c211412389be4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["colorVision"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
