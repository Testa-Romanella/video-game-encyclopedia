Enhance your build by installing a wide variety of upgrades.<br/></p>\n<p>RECURSOR's mechanics takes inspiration from the <strong>platform fighter genre</strong> with both movement and combat, but also classics in the platformer genre like <strong>Super Metroid</strong> and <strong>Celeste</strong>. This combined with randomized levels and upgrades of the rogue-lite genre multiplies the depth and replayability.</p>\n<p>RECURSOR has an extensive moveset allowing you complete freedom of movement! For the speedrunners and labbers, RECURSOR comes with a debug mode to move frame by frame, view your current state, see hitboxes and more!<br/></p>\n\n<p>RECURSOR's artstyle takes the classic pixel art charm and makes use of modern graphics technology to give it a fresh look. Most evidently is the lighting system that casts soft shadows and uses normal maps to create the illusion of 3d.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the scifi films and anime of the 80s and 90s, RECURSOR frames the game within a computer terminal / CCTV station that grants the user the ability to monitor and control the RECURSOR robot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T08:58:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd0/cd00afd1d23ad810865c7f39d2b6e771.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["schmoo"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
