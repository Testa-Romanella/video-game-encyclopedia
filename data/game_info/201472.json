You must exit each process (level) before the process <em>runs out of memory space</em>. You can create cubes to get to the exit trigger, but these use up memory. You can remove a limited amount of cubes to free up memory, but only at a limited distance. Later levels require you to obtain keys before you can exit.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move. Press 0 for no ability, 1 for cube building and 2 for cube removing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31a/31a7db64d03673b0181ad90f5e8b4c46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tritium5"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
