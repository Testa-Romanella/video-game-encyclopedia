There is no story, no clutter - everything is simple, minimalistic. Whole game tries to keep you focused on one simple goal, which is solving current puzzle.<br/><br/>To solve the puzzle, you need to click on a tile to change the colors of its neighboring tiles so that the expected pattern is reached. We have prepared <strong>lots</strong> of challenging levels, each including a PAR that displays the minimum number of turns necessary to complete the level. While appearing deceptively easy, the gameplay gets progressively harder to ensure the player is challenged at all times.<br/><br/>Minimal is very challenging and it will require a lot of brains to solve all the content. But don't worry, if you get stuck you can always go to other levels and come back later.Features<ul><li>250 hand-made levels<br/></li><li>Simple rules &amp; controls<br/></li><li>Hours of challenging gameplay</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-02T07:02:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/506/506c42487d2cb9560930965dcf7c84d6.jpg", "website": "http://minimal.gammosaur.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 29}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gammosaur"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gammosaur"], "esrb_rating": null}
