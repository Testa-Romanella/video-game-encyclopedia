{"id": 551240, "slug": "dying-lights", "name": "Dying Lights", "name_original": "Dying Lights", "description": "<p>This is my first Game Jam game. Use WASD to move and SPACE to interact with objects. Play as BulbBoy who has been sent to fix the lights at a strange house. Turns out its not just a house but a haunted house and it's inhabitants have a real big appetite for fruit. Use your light head to give electricity to specific objects and solve puzzles as you find your way out of the house. Very short micro/demo but I hope you enjoy it. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Attributes for extra game assets -</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Spooky_theme by NoFaceCH (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCes2SZaMbCf_GXwEBTGsnhA)</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Art:<br/>Moden Interirors Complete version LICENSE (https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors) by LimeZu (https://limezu.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>--<br/>Cover Art -\u00a0 by AaravosDaervic (https://twitter.com/Bobsters1999?s=09)</p>\n<p>Sounds:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Super Dialogue Audio Pack - (https://bckr.itch.io/sdap) by Dillon Becker (https://dillonbecker.com/) .
