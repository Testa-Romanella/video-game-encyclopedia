The game was released on November 9, 2010 on the Xbox Live Indie Game marketplace for 240 Microsoft points (the equivalent of $3.00). Tempura of the Dead was very well received, both in terms of sales and ratings (it still ranks high on the top rated list on the Xbox Live Marketplace). Critics praised the game&#39;s retro style, unique gameplay mechanics, and longevity. </p>\n<p>In the game, players take control of either Sugimoto, the samurai, or Thompson, the President. These men are two of only a few survivors of a zombie apocalypse in the United States. Rather than killing the zombies, Sugimoto teaches Thompson how to release their souls from their bodies, freeing them from the bondage. Eventually, the duo reach the source of the virus; a corrupted version of the Statue of Liberty. After defeating it, the United States is saved, and a closing cut scene depicts the two shaking hands and going their respective ways.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-14T02:55:32", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox 360"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
