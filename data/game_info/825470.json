{"id": 825470, "slug": "mischief-managed", "name": "Mischief Managed", "name_original": "Mischief Managed", "description": "<p>Mischief Managed is a retro 2D Top-Down game that I've been working on recently. In this game, you take the role of a newbie scientist who is having a horrible first day. After a genetic experiment went awry, your new co-workers have fled or vanished.. you're not too sure. There's blood, lots of blood. All you know is you need to avoid everything that moves and get the hell out of this rat-infested lab.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0fully intend to add several unique enemies, responsive audio/animations/effects, and many more levels. I\u00a0will be uploading iterations of the game here and eventually the final version. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to play this, if you like or dislike anything please come back and leave a comment to let me know. Any honest feedback is appreciated and I will take it all into account as I\u00a0continue with iterations of this game. Thanks for taking the time to play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T05:44:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/380/3805005c227330ddc4293a370cb9956e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
