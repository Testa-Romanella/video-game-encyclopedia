Jackarais did the art and I put the bits together. Our theme was \"Dinosaur Styled Collectathon Stealth Game\".\u00a0 Follow the adventure of one sneaky rat lad as he learns what it takes to become the dominant species.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to collect and hoard food without getting stomped to death. To do that, you have to use the environment as cover to stay safe from roaming dinosaur bullies.\u00a0Controls are: WASD/arrow key movement, E to interact/collect items,\u00a0R\u00a0for sprint (25 second cooldown on that i didnt have time to indicate in any way &gt;:O), P for pause, and, fun fact, there's a secret movement option, Sneak, that you can access if you press L. It slows you down to 1/4th of your speed and has no benefit at all.</p>\n<p>MUSIC IS BY THE FIETCHER BROS ON YOUTUBE!! https://www.youtube.com/user/dfiechter2\u00a0They make seriously great stuff, check them out for quality tunes you can use on non-commercial projects ^_~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:42:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/069/06968804ef654ec5266956ac5ea0d5c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["utzsar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
