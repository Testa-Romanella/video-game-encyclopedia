And be careful, not every obstacle is just static! There are also Virus vehicles driving along the track with you, trying to put an end to your existence.<br/><br/><br/>While playing you will collect electrons that unlock new powerups. The powerups will allow you to survive longer and defeat the Virus constructs. They are grouped in active ones that are reusable (e.g. missiles) and passive ones that are consumable (e.g. shield).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Play together with up to three friends on one PC.
