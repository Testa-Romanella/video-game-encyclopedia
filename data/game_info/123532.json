We are a team of three people, we split all jobs evenly between the three of us and finished this game within a month. </p><p>The game although completely playable, still needs more to go. The ultimate goal is to be able to implement this game into mobile. We decided to put up here as a pc playable for now to hopefully get the funds needed to bring this into the app store. </p><p><strong>Game Info<br/></strong></p><p>This is an infinite runner styled game, with the 80s theme look to it. The goal is to just survive as long as you can and get the highest score. Dodge enemies, collect power ups to survive longer. <br/>Do you think you can be the top player? Give it a shot and let us know what you think. <br/></p><p><strong>Future plans</strong><br/></p><p>So like stated earlier we would like to bring this into mobile, but we also have plenty of plans left for the game itself. We would love to add in more environments, add more to the UI, leaderboards, and plenty of other things. Any feedback given to us is greatly appreciated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d2/2d27c2965e26ed0af151979329a9412b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["coregamestudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
