Inspired by- ok... maybe let's skip that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Through her sexually frustrated eyes, we explore distinctly Singaporean characters-- their backstories, their circumstances, and their heroism.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In tandem, we have the opportunity with our gorgeous artwork and sound to highlight what is attractive in completely Singaporean terms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The experience we're going for is one of mounting tension as the characters break social scripts in order to overcome their isolation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the question of whether to cheat or not? Whether that's wrong or not? Whether it's just a fantasy or not? Are left to the player's interpretation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But hopefully, the answers you find impact the way you experience the ending and most importantly, leave you thinking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:41:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0d/c0d1aed8671edc5d01868967a1890b97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zmcn", "Kei", "Wavepool Music", "Keira Tang Yuan", "cylim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
