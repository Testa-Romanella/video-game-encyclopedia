Well, maybe not the ultimate, but is a lot of fun. But one thing you should know, no one has ever finished the game. It is just too hard.<br/><br/>Do you think you have what it takes?<br/><br/>Just hold your finger on the screen to guide the skier through the flags until you hit the end. Hit a flag, a tree, or take your finger off the screen.<br/><br/>But be warned, each level gets longer and harder.<br/><br/>No ads, no in app purchases. One price for the complete game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T05:03:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32e/32edac6097ecf829800d92a4d7763041.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["JOhn Lyons"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["JOhn Lyons"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
