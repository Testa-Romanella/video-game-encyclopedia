That will activate the door and block the laser. Second thing you do, is find another block and put it on the button that is on the door you just activated. Third thing, you can either open doors and go through the level with a shortcut or you can use the portals to break the door below and block the laser to just fall down. Then you just parkour through the rest of the level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T09:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c67/c6783a5b9e69d575c1a9a81a95f33116.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["deactiveasdf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
