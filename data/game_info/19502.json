James Patterson is on his way to the wedding of his sister at the manor of a wealthy Romanian Duke. Upon arriving at the destination, James sees crosses nailed to the doors and meets a holy father who tells the protagonist that this manor is a home for vampires and the Pattersons are held prisoner.</p>\n<p>The objective of the player is to save every one of their family and fight back the vampires. At the beginning of every game, the rooms in the manor are generated randomly using several templates. The players are given some time to find a save a family member. Should the player fail, the game&#39;s boss will grow stronger. The more family of yours you save, the easier it will be to fight the final boss.</p>\n<p>Initially, the only weapons James has are a sword and bare fists, yet it is possible to find new weapons, such as firearms or classic vampire hunter weaponry later in the game. There are notes scattered around the manor which describe the monsters and how to fight them.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2003-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:39:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/559/559fb67a9c379630bbb821595e102bee_2EQC8gc.jpg", "website": "http://kiss-ltd.co.uk/", "rating": 3.07, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 90, "owned": 1795, "beaten": 46, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 55, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 153, "suggestions_count": 450, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 154, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Idol FX"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Kiss", "Funbox Media", "Blue Moon Red Owl"], "esrb_rating": null}
