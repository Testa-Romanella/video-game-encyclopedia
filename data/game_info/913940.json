Users can log in by connecting themselves to the computer, choose a gear and enter it. Sadly, due to recent events, a Rogue AI has been infecting all the systems. To shorten it, we just call it virus. <br/></p>\n<p>Thus we have called upon you (and others) to help us destroy the virus before it reaches the core and consumes it all. You'll be granted a special suit, of which you can choose your own gear. Choose between the various heads, torsos and legs. Weapons too. Just beware of the heat meter. The burn feeling is real.</p>\n<p>We must keep our chatter brief, for the virus could be listening in. For all we know, it could even use the gear settings as well. Beware.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Comms closed.<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>... And it will be a treat</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Made for Godot Wild Jam #53, theme \"Assembly required\".<br/>Wildcards used.: \"Wait What?\", \"Thermometer\".</p>\n<p>Despite the low quality, I do hope that whoever plays it enjoys the \"adventure\". Bit more than what I could chew so much of what I wanted to do isn't in.\u00a0<br/>I'm not going back tho.
