Sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and your brain forgets to un paralyze your body and you can't move any part of your body except your eyelids. This causes panic and makes you hallucinate really scary things and they seem very realistic but they're just your imagination. You can't un paralyze yourself so you just gotta ignore the entire thing and fall asleep till its morning and you're un paralyzed.</p>\n<p>In this game, you must click on the shadows to get rid of them. If there are more than 3 shadows in the room, you loose the game and then something happens (surprise! Wait actually no the surprise is kinda scuffed). Good luck</p>\n<p>Also sleep paralysis is a real thing and a lot of people are affected by it regularly.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Code: BigManCloudy<br/>Music and art: Lil Pogchamp<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36a/36a01e6b23293f36cae808c236e66648.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BigManCloudy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
