There's no real story or anything yet since this current version is a proof of concept. <br/></p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>There's no BGM or SFX save for a few placeholder sounds atm, and there's some things missing like status effect icons or card scores, but the game's totally playable in its current state despite that!<br/></p>\n<p>The goal of this current version is to gauge player interest and hopefully build a community around this idea in the hopes of using everyone's feedback to make this game the best I possibly can.</p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you have fun playing it! And if you'd like, you can join our discord server in community link below to talk about the game with others and let me know what you thought. Thanks!<br/></p>\n<p>(Most fatal errors should be fixed, if it happens just restart the client)<em><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure you save after each fight! There's no autosave, and there's a few things that will cause the client to crash at the moment, so be wary.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Discord &gt;&gt; </strong><strong>Community Server</strong><br/><br/><strong>[This page will be updated as the game's development progresses.]</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T16:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15a/15a2da0274a01517be32a94cda4b6007.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Riddel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
