Despite that, only PC and Mac builds were done. As a flea, your objective is to reach the end of the beard strands while avoiding the dragon, sheeps and wolves.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Daniel - Programming and Game Design</p><p>Kevin MacLeod - Music</p><p>FreeSound.org - Sound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54eb1ac2c7f90d271a4fac078d7a8248.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Daniel Jung"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
