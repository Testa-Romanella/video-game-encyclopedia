You're a mortal that broke into the Underworld and took an artifact to steal other's souls. To escape the underworld you have to defeat the Reaper. You don't lose your progress when you die, only your items and healing flasks. Attack the Reaper statue to enter the last fight!<br/></p>\n<p>The game has controller support (recommended!) but you can play with keyboard and mouse also.<br/></p>\n<p>We used Unity 2019, Blender, FL Studio and some Gimp.<br/>We decided to make a 3D game, even though we have no 3D nor 2D artist in the group, so the whole week was a learning experience.<br/>The main programmer was learning about Unity during the jam, while the main 3D artist (who is not a 3D artist, he's actually a software developer IRL) was learning about 3D modelling and animations (took 4 days of the jam to be able to consistently export the models and animations and to learn how to animate in Blender and export to Unity, etc), so it was a bit messy.</p>\n<p>Project source is available on https://github.com/hsnavarro/roguesoulslike-7drl<br/></p>\n<p>Henrique Navarro - Programmer (Whole gameplay)<br/>Jo\u00e3o Pedro Xavier - Programmer (Map generation) / 3D Artist (Items)<br/>Jos\u00e9 Maria Arcanjo - Music<br/>Luciano Barreira - Programmer (Intro UI) / Sound effects<br/>Naum Azeredo - 3D Artist (Models and animations) / Programmer (Bug fixing and adding animations)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T10:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90c/90cff4b79034dd76dd3ca4e26c67801e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["kogyblack", "hsnavarro"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
