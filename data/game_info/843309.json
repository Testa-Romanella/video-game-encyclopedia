It's very bare-bones in terms of art etc. There's no sound or music.\u00a0It was a learning experience. I'll probably keep working on it after the jam,\u00a0so if you like it and want to see what it turns into let me know!</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T11:24:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c92/c92cac3cfcadc9c7024be44b5b57f33e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Triangletriangle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
