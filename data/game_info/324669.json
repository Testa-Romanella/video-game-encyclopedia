You do this by cutting off other traffic or by almost crashing into the back of them. The closer you get, the more points you earn.\u00a0If you get really close, then the bar in the top left turns green and you get +50%.</p>\n<p>There are\u00a0six different types of cars; including famous ones like Lambo Aventador, Ferrari 458 and generic van with racing stripes. The cars drive at varying speeds, so how does the traffic not crash into one another?</p><p>The game was inspired by a roadtrip to Italy last summer. Their impeccable ability to have near accidents on narrow mountain roads\u00a0needed to be turned into a game.</p>\n<p><strong>Total development time: 19 hours</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74b/74bf0d4a843aebe246d5ff01414b7569.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mika la Grand"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
