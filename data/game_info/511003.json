{"id": 511003, "slug": "labyrinth-sprint-demo", "name": "Labyrinth Sprint (Demo)", "name_original": "Labyrinth Sprint (Demo)", "description": "<p>Blending the timeless dot collection and ghost avoidance formula of pac-man with hit points, equipment pickups, varying levels and randomly selected monsters, Labyrinth Sprint aims to steal some of your time on Linux and Windows*. It's programmed using the Rust programming language and the full source code of the game will be released under the GPL licence once it is complete.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to clear levels and get through to the final boss. Levels can be cleared by either collecting all of the coins (which contributes to the highest possible score) or killing all of the monsters. Killing monsters, however, reduces the players health; and with the only way to regenerate it via occasionally spawned health potions, the monsters are probably best to be avoided.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are items of equipment littered around the mazes to help stack these odds marginally more in your favour, but a canny player will have to learn to navigate around the mazes without being spotted; for as soon as one monster spots you, the whole horde will give chase...</p>\r\nKickstarter\r\n<p>There is currently a Kickstarter campaign running to raise funds for the game's development. Any money raised through here will help to make Labyrinth Sprint a better game.<br/></p>\r\nTODO\r\n<p>Development of the game is well advanced, but there are still many things left to do before it can be released.</p>\n<p>Those things left are:</p>\n<ul><li>Adding sounds!</li><li>Fixing the menu system which, while functional, is a little user un-friendly.</li><li>Adding more monsters, levels and pickups.</li><li>A final level with a boss fight so you can actually finish the game.</li><li>A tutorial so you aren't thrown straight into the deep end.</li><li>Balance tweaking and bug fixing.</li><li>Basic i18n support (internationalization)<br/></li></ul>\r\nGiving Back\r\n<p>Over the course of the development of Labyrinth Spring I've benefited greatly from the expertise and generosity of the community. I'm also a firm believer in open source software, without it the development of the game would have been impossible in the time frame allowed by my savings.</p>\n<p>The source code for Labyrinth Sprint (but not the game resources such as graphics and sounds) will be released on github when the game is finished. This way others can hopefully learn from it and if they want to play it on other, future platforms, porting it across should be made much easier.</p>\n<p>Once the game is released, I also intend to donate 10% of all profits from the sale of the game to some of the open source projects it is built upon wherever possible, so that they can continue to improve and keep helping others.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T06:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea7/ea715a439395a4e0adfaf5bf13a0fee1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["BezPowell"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
