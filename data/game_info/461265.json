{"id": 461265, "slug": "thekla", "name": "Thekla", "name_original": "Thekla", "description": "The Art Direction Project, was a collaboration between the Master and Bachelor students at KADK.<br/>The goal was\u00a0for all students to try working as in a team with a formal structure on a 3D project. The students\u00a0were tasked with setting up and managing a workflow and production pipeline within their team, and students\u00a0were asked to volunteer for preferred development roles before the project started.\u00a0<br/>Two separate project were created\u00a0by five teams consisting of both bachelor and master students, both of which were based on the book Invisible Cities\u00a0by Italo Calvino, where students had to select a description of one of the cities to base their 3D project on.<br/>The projects were created in Unity, and the usage of online assets were permitted.\r\nThekla from Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino<br/><br/>Those who arrive at Thekla can see little of the city, beyond the plank fences, the sackcloth screens, the scaffoldings, the metal armatures, the wooden catwalks hanging from ropes or supported by sawhorses, the ladders, the trestles. If you ask \"Why is Thekla's construction taking such a long time?\" the inhabitants continue hoisting sacks, lowering leaded strings, moving long brushes up and down, as they answer \"So that it's destruction cannot begin.\" And if asked whether they fear that, once the scaffoldings are removed, the city may begin to crumble and fall to pieces, they add hastily, in a whisper, \"Not only the city.\"<br/>If, dissatisfied with the answers, someone puts his eye to a crack in a fence, he sees cranes pulling up other cranes, scaffoldings that embrace other scaffoldings, beams that prop up other beams. \"What meaning does your construction have?\" he asks. \"What is the aim of a city under construction unless it is a city? Where is the plan you are following, the blueprint?\"<br/>\"We will show it to you as soon as the working day is over; we cannot interrupt our work now,\" they answer.<br/>Work stops at sunset. Darkness falls over the building site. The sky is filled with stars. \"There is the blueprint,\" they say.\r\nProject 1 - Week 1 &amp; 2\r\nGroup 4 members\r\n<p>Milas Norman - Art Director</p>\n<p>Michael Tran - Lead Artist</p>\n<p>Casper \u00d8bro - Tech Artist</p>\n<p>Sofia Holm - 3d Artist</p>\n<p>Anna R\u00fcth - Concept Artist</p>\n<p>Jonas Halver - Texture Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f811c7f31f1f0e8b2f83f32938e3de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KADKGAME"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
