{"id": 263114, "slug": "jetsam-jam", "name": "Jetsam Jam", "name_original": "Jetsam Jam", "description": "<p>Jetsam Jam is a small game that I built in a month using Unity. It was mostly improvised early on, but as some interesting mechanics revealed themselves, the development process became more targeted. This game is a unique 2D fighting game that utilizes some simple physics, resource management, and skill-shots to pit you and your friends in exciting space battles.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Your primary goal, since this is a fighting game, is to defeat your opponent by claiming all of their stocks. There are two ways for a player to lose a stock:</p>\n<ul><li>Being pulled/pushed into a star</li><li>Reaching a max fuel of 0</li></ul>\n<p>You have a limited amount of fuel at your disposal. You can get fuel back in two ways:</p>\n<ul><li>Entering the gravitational range of a star</li><li>Bouncing into an arena wall with no fuel</li></ul>\n<p>Your max fuel is lowered every time you are stunned; you lose more max fuel from lasers than from wakes.</p>\n<p>Your laser uses all the fuel you currently have, but stuns for longer when you fire it with more fuel. The knockback you experience from firing the laser also is dependent on how much fuel you had when you fired it.</p>\n<p>When you use fuel to propel yourself, you leave a wake behind you. This wake pushes and stuns other players. Wakes from opposing players destroy one another. Your wake is stronger and larger when turning around than when continuing in the same direction.</p>\n<p>Being stunned isn't the end of the world; you can see your stun duration clearly and try to plan your next move.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>This game <strong>requires </strong>the use (at least for now) of two Xbox Controllers.</p>\n<ul><li>Left stick - Movement</li><li>Right stick - Aim laser</li><li>Right bumper - Fire laser</li><li>Start - Reset map (at game's end)</li><li>Select - Select new map (at game's end)</li></ul>\n\r\nBugs\r\n<p>Since this game was created in a month, there are bound to be some problems. Please feel free to leave comments explaining any difficulties you're having with the game. That being said, I hope it works swimmingly. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e25/e253d50d472c3bb41aa4163dbf5f160f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jack Davis"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
