You play as a rogue mage who tapped into dark arts to try and gain more power but as soon as you opened a dusty old book, Fafnir was summoned and not pleased, which caused him to place a curse on you and sent you to a eternal dungeon. To survive you must battle through all the floors until you make it to Fafnir so you can break the curse and return back to the overworld.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T02:48:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/851/85145c1843449a2eb03d65674e7192bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Justice"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["James Justice"], "esrb_rating": null}
