Players have 5 seconds to memorize the cards. After 5 seconds, the 8 cards on the left will flip over and be face-down.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe objective of the game is for players to click on the cards on the left side to reveal them one at a time. If the card matches the one on the right, the enemy will be attacked and lose a certain amount of health. Conversely, if the cards do not match, the player will be attacked and lose a certain amount of health.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers must use their memory and quick thinking to uncover matching cards as fast as possible to attack the enemy and protect themselves. When the enemy's health bar reaches zero, the player wins the game and unlocks a beautiful CG image. Additionally, the player can choose one of three power-ups: attack power, combo power, or health, to enhance their abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, if the player's health bar reaches zero, the game ends in defeat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGet ready to test your memory, speed, and strategic skills in this exciting game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-04T02:42:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/805c4ab790a6ad7b130863c3075dcbc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LP  Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LP  Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
