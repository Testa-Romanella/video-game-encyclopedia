We're delivering a gaming experience that looks modern but feels fun and familiar. <strong>A game made BY wrestling fans, FOR wrestling fans.</strong>Our Philosophy<br/>Our mission with Pro Wrestling X is clear and attainable: <br/><br/><ul><li> Focus on simple-but-deep gameplay mechanics that are FUN!<br/></li><li> Build a game that's open and moddable. Give PC gamers the freedom and tools to create and share new content.<br/></li><li> Create a wrestling game platform that evolves and grows \u2013 and never goes backwards.<br/></li><li> The ultimate goal: the fun of WWF No Mercy + the depth of Fire Pro Wrestling.<br/></li><li> Give love and respect to pro wrestling for the memories it has given us.</li></ul>Roadmap to 1.0<br/>Thanks to a successful Kickstarter, we're committed to delivering the following functionality for our 1.0 release:<br/><br/><ul><li> Movement \u2013 Standard D-pad/stick directional movement; running/Irish whips; climb turnbuckle; enter/exit ring to floor; block/perry/escape (think WWF No Mercy); pick up downed opponent; taunt; pinfall attempt.<br/></li><li> Grappling \u2013 4 front grapple moves; 2 back grapple moves; 1 corner grapple; 1 special/finisher.<br/></li><li> Striking/submission \u2013 3 strikes; 2 ground submissions; 1 ground strike; 2 flying turnbuckle moves.<br/></li><li> Extras \u2013 3 playable characters; 1 base arena; blue steel cage (made most famous in WWF Wrestlefest); &amp;quot;international objects&amp;quot; (aka weapons).<br/></li><li> Controls \u2013 Keyboard and USB gamepad support (XBox 360 controller compatible)</li></ul>Current Status: Early Access<br/>Pro Wrestling X is an Early Access title, probably not for the faint of heart. We've started with basic movement, striking and grappling, and as we perfect each mechanism, we'll keep adding more. <strong>If you are looking for a complete game and don't want to see how the sausage is made, hold off for now.</strong> Add us to your Wishlist and circle back in a bit!<br/><br/>If, however, you want to witness a wrestling game get developed from the ground up and have your voice heard along the way, hop aboard the crazy train. There may be bugs and glitches and a not-so-deep experience on day one, but we're not going to stop \u2013 and <strong>we'd love your help!</strong>Nice things said about us<br/>&amp;quot;I'm very happy to make a donation for this. Best of luck as always and hope to see this come to completion!&amp;quot;<br/><strong>\u2013 Producer of WWF No Mercy, Sanders Keel, backing our Kickstarter</strong><br/><br/>&amp;quot;it's been a long-road for the game so far... we're betting that its passionate developers won't be pinned to the mat quite so easily.&amp;quot;<br/><strong>\u2013 PC Gamer</strong><br/><br/>&amp;quot;...An independently developed game that aimed to bring back the glory days of No Mercy was a thing that I very much wanted to play.&amp;quot;<br/><strong>\u2013 RockPaperShotgun.com</strong><br/><br/>&amp;quot;With Pro Wrestling X ... coming out, the future of wrestling games could be bright once more.&amp;quot;<br/><strong>\u2013 Kotaku UK</strong>Stay in touch<br/>We're all over the Interweb.
