You click the skull to gain bones, the more bones you gain, the more bones you make. With enough bones you can summon powerful (and cute) monsters to help you become rich with bones!</p>\n\n<p>The music used in game was not created by myself.

Sorry about that! I hope you have fun with this simple clicker game. Hopefully if i have time I will update it with new features e.g shops, monsters, permanent upgrades, saving, leader boards and achievements. This is my first attempt at a UI heavy game, and clicker game and it was a lot of fun to make.*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T11:22:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57e/57e00c7cb53e1fe0741e323ecc2adffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sp00kz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
