(Even if borders are closed, but nobody knows that.) Grab, aim and shoot your travel essentials to the evil suitcase in your main bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>You can't use doors! Oh no. No, no. Destroy your house foundation with the very couch you rest on, and kick down those walls to the rooms in your house to find the missing items.\u00a0</p><p>Easy, right? Except there's a timer! Crew captain will not wait for you. Get fast and furiously frustrated with OverPacked!
