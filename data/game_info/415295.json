On the open water, they\u2019re captured by the pull of an unseen force and wash up on a mysterious island, their boat destroyed. To their dismay and horror, the island is populated by possessed wood and stone spirits, all seemingly centered around the ruins of a lost civilization on the island! With Freddy\u2019s skill at making tools and objects, and Carlos\u2019s can-do attitude and aptitude with a spear (though not with a boat), the two brothers must venture forth and discover the secret at the heart of the island!</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE GUYS BEHIND THE GAME:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Hi, everyone! We're four amateur game developers at the University of Texas at Austin who had a week and a half to develop a working prototype for a narrative-based game. <em>Psysis\u00a0</em>is the result! We all had a ton of fun working on this game, and hope that you enjoy playing our prototype! Everything but the player character sprites and the boss sprite was made/coded from scratch. Sounds were downloaded from www.freesound.org.</p>\n<p><strong>Pete Cimino:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Environment Artist / Tileset Artist / UI Artist</li><li>Sprite Artist (enemies, pickups, and environmental)</li><li>Level Designer</li><li>Animator (enemies)</li><li>Intro Cutscene Animation/Dialogue</li><li>Boss Fight Gameplay Scripter</li><li><strong>Pixel Monkey</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Ethan Godwin:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Writer\u00a0</li><li>Gameplay Engineer</li><li>Producer</li><li>Scripter</li><li>Sound Engineer</li><li><strong>Honorary Project Dad</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Victor Do:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Head Scripter</li><li>Head Animator</li><li>Cutscene Animator / Dialogue Engineer</li><li>UI Design/ Scripting</li><li>Crafting Scripter</li><li>Enemy Scripter</li><li><strong>Absolute Mad Lad</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Jordan Jenkins:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Player Character Artist</li><li>Boss Sprite Artist</li><li>Weapon Designer/Artist</li><li><strong>Chill Beats to Play Sonic To</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T02:36:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/887/887305b87d437e6fe98bfc329511c9cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PeterCimino"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
