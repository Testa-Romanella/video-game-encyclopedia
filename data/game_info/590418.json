Can you defeat the epic final boss?</p>\n<p>This is a project I've been working on in my spare time, I liked the challenge of creating everything you need to make a game myself (sprites, animations, code, music,...). I learned a lot and had a ton of fun. I hope to use the knowledge and experience I gained from this to make more advanced and interesting games in the future. Plenty of ideas, just need the time to work them all out.</p>\n<p>Spaaace might not be the best looking game and the programming is poorly optimised. It ain't much, but it's honest work :)</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out my game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:31:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/478/47807760986fef570e78edec7b6974b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ScabbyOldBat"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
