While the sequencing is fairly basic, it was great fun to make work using Hypercard and watch what other people created. It simulates what a surreal digital museum might look like, taking cues from my own work as well as that of others such as Dumbtype (JP) in an interactive environment.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T07:21:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e75/e758647f8976c6b6db49a8dc96ab0604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Tom"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
