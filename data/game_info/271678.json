You can hold down the button to suck up lots of units or drop lots of units. Once you're done, click the Relocate button again to finish. (This whole process only uses 1 action point, but use it wisely)</p>\n<p>You can also use <strong>Shamans</strong><strong> (purple figure)</strong>\u00a0directly, click on one and it'll show a list of <strong>Shaman abilities</strong>, these work much the same as Site abilities, but they can also require a number of souls, a Shaman can gather souls by killing followers and the like, granting them more powers. If you have a Shaman\u00a0gain many souls from killing, they can be later sacrificed to the Serpent God by sacrificing the Shaman at the <strong>Serpent Totem</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, sacrificing increases <strong>Rebellion</strong> in the town, for every Rebellion over <strong>5</strong>, a new <strong>Rebel (red figure)</strong> is spawned in the town, and rebellion will go down slightly.\u00a0But each turn that ends with a Rebel in the town, the rebellion will increase by 1 per Rebel.<br/>You can deal with Rebels by building a <strong>Temple </strong>and <strong>Re-educating</strong> them, or building a <strong>Barracks</strong> and training\u00a0<strong>Soldiers (green figures)</strong>, if a Soldier ends their turn on the same site as a Rebel, they will kill each other. <strong>Temples</strong> and <strong>Watchtowers</strong> can also help reduce Rebellion before Rebels are spawned.</p>\n<p>Once you're out of useful actions, <strong>End the Turn</strong> in the bottom right.<br/>However, the Serpent God requires at least one sacrifice per turn, if you fail to provide this, she will make your followers <strong>Sick (black figure)</strong> and you'll need to heal them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a91/a91862fbe9e80f90d2e8aee287f4a0e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Impbox Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
