{"id": 109475, "slug": "recall-itch", "name": "Recall (itch)", "name_original": "Recall (itch)", "description": "<p>Ludum Dare 37 Entry - Jam Category</p><p>We took the approach exploring psychological problems of a person, facing his fears, trying to get rid of darkness and finding things lost. A person trapped not only in his room but in his mind. A room sometimes is not only a shelter and a personal intimate space, but also can be a cage, an obstacle, a confinement cell.</p><p>You're the projected psyche of a person who tries to find that single thing (a ring) to regain his sanity.</p><p>The ring is hidden in the room and you have to find it. To move you have to press the left mouse button to burst light and then you can move with wasd or arrows when the light's on.</p><p>Hope you enjoy it as much as we had fun making it. If you find bugs please tell us in the comments.</p><p>Authors:</p><p>Anil Ayaz - Art, Design</p><p>Rodolink - Programming, Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/507/507ef5d22483fa472ba96db575d273c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rodolink"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
