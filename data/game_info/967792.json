Viewer discretion is advised.<h3>Summary:</h3><strong>Degradation: Kyomu's Fury - \u52a3\u5316\uff1a\u30ad\u30e7\u30e0\u306e\u6012\u308a</strong> is a 3D bullet-hell/FPS game in which you explore a strange, seemingly abandoned island while discovering its hidden, vast virtual network. Fight viruses, survive insane waves of rays and bullets, and find out more about the inhabitants of the Network.<h3>Some overall primary features:</h3><ul><li>Up to thirteen chapters and three possible endings.<br/></li><li>A variety of locations, alternating between short exploration and boss battles.<br/></li><li>6 difficulty modes, including a practice mode, and a \"MEGA\" mode with unique enemy attack patterns, best suited for a second playthrough.<br/></li><li>A light story about AI, viruses, and making new virtual friends!</li></ul><h3>Gameplay considerations</h3><ul><li>The game can be played with a controller, but a keyboard and mouse setup is recommended.<br/></li><li>DLSS is available.<br/></li><li>Realtime ray/path tracing is necessary for some of the effects used in the game. Thus, a GPU capable of handling this type of rendering is required.</li></ul><h3>Bonus content:</h3><ul><li>A game not previously released on Steam, titled World Annihilation Operations: Space Manipulation. It showcases various sci-fi and surreal environments in which space seems unstable. From impossible objects, to teleportation portals, or multiple depths of reflections, explore 5 levels of weird visuals while occasionally solving environmental puzzles.<br/></li><li>A second much smaller game, never released anywhere, developed in the context of a game prototype design class a few years ago. It is a simple platformer game set in a long tunnel where gravity works in mysterious ways.<br/></li><li>A music player, letting you listen to the music found within the main game, at your own leisure.</li></ul>This content can be unlocked through specific in-game challenges, or immediately, as gifts for buying one of my DLCs (essentially donations).<h3>Academic context:</h3>This game (as well as the first bonus game) is done in the context of a PhD research on the integration of logical contradictions in video game fiction. It is expected that more games emerge from this research. Following the publication of these works, the operations developed through the creation process should lead to the development of one much larger adventure game in the coming years.<br/><br/><br/><strong>This game is entirely free. If you would like to support the developer, please consider purchasing one of the DLCs (they do not add any content not accessible within the game!).</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-16T03:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa5/aa571831b9c0c82f938017cc3d4cb9e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jesse Aidyn"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jesse Aidyn"], "esrb_rating": null}
