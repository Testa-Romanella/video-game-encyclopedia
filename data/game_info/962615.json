A binary planet system orbiting its red dwarf host. You join us in the midst of a skirmish between the inhabitants of two worlds on the brink of interplanetary war.<br/><br/>The Avians (a bird-like species) occupy the original home world, with their distant cousins, the Trivexians (a reptile species) colonising and inhabiting its twin. Both planets originally had temperate climates with resources to spare, and while the Avians managed to maintain and protect their biosphere, the Trivexians could not; then following a climate catastrophe their world was reduced to an arid, near lifeless desert.<br/><br/>As resources diminished and calls for aid met with reluctance, the Trivexians became envious of their Avian cousin\u2019s world, with its tantalising oceans and luscious purple vegetation. Following a number of incursions to take what they believed was rightfully theirs, the fighting ensued. Join the battle, pick a side, fight for a cause, and destroy the enemy.<br/><br/>\u2018Gemini: Binary Conflict\u2019 is a multiplayer, class based, first person shooter set in an exotic environment with a bold visual style.
