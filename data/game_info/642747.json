There's a lot of updates to come as well. It's currently in alpha and I'll have at least a good year before it's a realized and fleshed out\u00a0game.\u00a0Feel free to leave feedback or suggestions, I'd be happy to discuss mechanics and monsters!<br/><br/>First release! man it feels good to put this out there. So far there are three buttons, and a LOT of mechanics surrounding them. to note what they do, human button places humans, animal button places animals, &amp; monster button places monsters.\u00a0 But the way each type interacts is unique and can cause some fun fights.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T08:41:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ea/6ea2948360a20412b8549e46e66739cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BTL games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
