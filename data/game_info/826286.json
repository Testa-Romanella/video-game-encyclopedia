You may drop away and fizzle out, but watch out \u2014 doing so summons a deadly mine!</p>\n<p>This game was designed for a tiny DIY console I made using only a dial and one action button. On the web and computer ports, the mouse replaces the dial.\u00a0The action button is mapped to the mouse buttons.</p>\n<p>To experience this game as it was meant to be, you'll need some supplies:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Raspberry Pi Pico (the $4 microcontroller)</li><li>OLED display (around $9 for two)</li><li>Breadboard</li><li>Jumper wires</li><li>One push-button switch</li><li>One 10k\u03a9 potentiomter</li></ul>\n<p>Most of these components can be found\u00a0in a single kit alongside many other parts that could be useful in future exploration. Wire it up as shown in MiniConsole_Schematics_A5.pdf in the pico.zip. If you move the wrong direction, you've reversed the connections to your potentiometer.</p>\n<p>The official documentation will tell you how to put MicroPython onto your Raspberry Pi Pico.\u00a0 Then simply upload the files \"miniconsole.py\", \"SSD1315.py\", \"starfall.py\", and \"main.py\" to the system using Thonny or rshell.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T11:29:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ad/0ad51acd7cf6f3895f86cafbaeabf54c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pineberry Fox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
