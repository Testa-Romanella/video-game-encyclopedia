The game features a silly, cute, and comical look which will be achieved through a stylized cartoon look with exaggerated characters and colorful environments. Players will have to proceed through the levels befriending demon bosses on each level to proceed up the tower. However the princess and her family and extended family of demon generals stand in your way. While these bosses will throw everything at you; you are only able to avoid the attacks of the demon boss on each floor, as you don\u2019t want to harm your potential future\u00a0in-laws. Use your jumping and evasive maneuvers to befriend the boss and get to the next level via a portal behind the boss until you get to the top of the tower where the Demon Princess awaits. Hopefully, you have proven your worth to her by the time you get to the top of the tower.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:06:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a1684b38d63152a3091e3f646a6cc45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Donovan Garcia-Buckler", "Dante Xystus", "James Ofori"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
