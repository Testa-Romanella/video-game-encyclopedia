We even include a fully automatic mode if you just want to site back and watch the game play itself.<br/><br/>Twelve piles of cards are dealt out in the pattern of a clock face, the last 4 cards are placed in a pile in the centre of the circle.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to avoid the Kings. If you turn over all the other cards before finding the 4 kings then you win.<br/><br/>Play starts by turning over the card in the central pile. When a card is revealed, it is placed on the pile at the corresponding hour and the top card of that pile is turned over. If a King is revealed, it is placed on the central pile.<br/><br/>We highlight which card to turn over next and will help to put it on the right pile so you can't go wrong.
