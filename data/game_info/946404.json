One day his autopilot goes haywire and he crash lands on the planet Pepaja.</p>\n<p>There the spaceship shatters into three parts. These three parts are now scattered on Pepaja and Captain Coco has to find them again to be able to fly away from this planet.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is relatively simple. Coco can do a single jump and a double jump. He cannot run. So the player has to decide how he wants to do the jump.</p>\n<p>The jump is unloaded, so the second jump can be staggered.</p>\n<p>Scope of the game:</p>\n<p>- Three game worlds</p>\n<p>- A total of 24 levels</p>\n<p>- Intro and Extro</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T16:25:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/038/038096d3dda28eccddc1d224b25fb15c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["grinseengel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
