The local town cats would love to join you for the ride too, if that's ok.</p>\n<p>Short Trip is the first instalment in a collection of interactive illustrations created for the web. It has been\u00a0created as a study into capturing the essence of graphite on paper within a digital context, and to learn more about web-based graphics technologies. Short Trip will run on most devices supporting WebGL, including mobile devices.<br/></p>\n<p>The original release was made at \u00a0alexanderperrin.com.au/paper/shorttrip</p>\n<p>Due to the current limitations of both WebGL technologies and my understanding of them, there\u2019s bound to be issues found here and there. If you\u2019ve found something particularly odd and have a spare few minutes it would be greatly appreciated if you tell me about it either via itch or\u00a0here. At the moment there\u2019s a few known issues particularly relating to Android support. I hope that these will improve with time.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I hope that you enjoy your journey.</p>\n<p><strong>Desktop Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left Key:\u00a0Move left</li><li>Right\u00a0Key:\u00a0Move right</li><li>Space bar:\u00a0Ring the bell</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Mobile Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Hold left side of screen:\u00a0Move left</li><li>Hold right side of screen:\u00a0Move right</li><li>Tap on the tram:\u00a0Ring the bell</li></ul>\n<p>Thank you to my family, friends, and cat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad9/ad99b72dd0c41ce072a3dd24ab5ee673.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alexander Perrin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
