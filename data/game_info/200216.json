Honestly, the singleplayer is meh but everyone who played the multiplayer found it fun. There was originally planned to be a Climb mode\u00a0 where you just try to keep hitting the ball as high as you can. I didn't have time to do it justice though so I didn't include it. The button is there as a reminder of what could've been.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the menu music is either \"The Tale of Ehrgeiz\"\u00a0from Ehrgeiz or \"\u30b5\u30f3\u30b8\u3068\u30a6\u30bd\u30c3\u30d7(Sanji and Usopp)\"\u00a0from One Piece. The in game music is the Lucio Ball music from Overwatch. Yeah enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47a/47a62ffd5d522bbc360dd1de04a385c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JetaluskiPro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
