That's right, with every new delivery you have to avoid a ghost of yourself who delivers previous package. While the number of deliveries grows, the game becomes difficult. Night Shift has a very simple controller (only left and right direction) but packs lots of fun with 5 amazing levels. And since our Leader sees everything, your story will end in the newspaper, so better make sure its a happy one. And there is also fun with ragdolls.</p>\n\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 42 Compo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/9179ed3dc1c1b22398ba8e770e59d8da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TomekS"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
