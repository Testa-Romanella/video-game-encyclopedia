This is mostly a prototype to demonstrate the crafting mechanics.</p>\n<p>By merging buildings you unlock new bigger ones which types are based on what were the building used to craft them. <br/></p>\r\nCommands:\r\n<ul><li>Use your <strong>mouse</strong> to select a group of <strong>four buildings</strong></li><li><strong>Click to craft</strong> a new one out of them.</li><li>Hold <strong>middle button</strong> to <strong>rotate </strong><em><br/>other ways of rotating the camera will be added soon for laptop users</em></li><li><strong>Scroll</strong> to <strong>zoom</strong>. </li></ul>\r\nInformation:\r\n<p>This project is more a <em>toy</em> than a <em>game</em>. In an upcoming version you'll be able to select which building to place on the map, and to upgrade existing buildings, making it a proper game. Follow me here or on twitter to get news about this and my other projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d773644a00245c99c04c0584f7c429d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tim Krief"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
