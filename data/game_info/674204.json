In all cases found, this is by means of a series of doors appearing in the walls, all in a straight line, such that it is possible to walk forwards and end up at the starting position. The alteration to the rooms does not affect neighbouring rooms and floors. There is as of yet no known explanation for the appearance of this phenomenon.<br/><br/>SCP-970-01 is a cell-block within Sector 19, and the first example of the SCP-970 phenomenon encountered by the Foundation. It was constructed with the intent of housing class-D personnel, and fulfilled that purpose until \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, when several D-classes breached containment in an escape attempt. The investigation into the incident led to the discovery that a series of doors had appeared in the cell-block, leading into rooms on the opposite side of the corridor. It was quickly established that the layout of the building did not support this addition, and that the rooms were following a non-standard geometry.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T02:32:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d0777c556b0d1909db38cd93b15879c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HJ GAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HJ GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
