The pieces are randomly located on the shelves or hidden in the cabinets. If you have a Pendant of Life and run out of time, 60 seconds will be added to your clock. The faster and more accurate you are, the better you'll score\u00a0and win\u00a0<strong>BIG PRIZES</strong>.</p>\n<p>Post your score in the comments to earn bragging rights.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>WASD:\u00a0Move</p>\n<p>Left mouse button: hold to pick up and drag items/doors</p>\n<p>Right mouse button:\u00a0hold the right mouse button while holding an item to rotate it. If you're on a mousepad (wtf, seriously) you can rebind RotateMoveable in the Unity launcher</p>\n<p>Shift:\u00a0sprint</p>\n<p>Space:\u00a0jump</p>\n<p>ESC:\u00a0Menu</p>\n<p>PROTIPS</p>\n<p>The monkey is slippery. Firmly grasp your monkey!</p>\n<p>Release the right mouse button frequently to recenter the held item. This prevents slippage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The head is the hardest piece to fit correctly. It's easier to insert the rod first, then rotate the head to align in the correct direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If it seems like you should win but haven't triggered victory, try jiggling the monkey's pieces to ensure a good fit.</p>\n<p>If the game seems hard, it's because it is! The sponsors expect a 30% pass rate. Hate the sponsors, not the game!</p>\n<p>KNOWN ISSUES</p>\n<p>Sometimes the pieces get stuck in the geometry. Try hitting it with another piece. If that sounds unfair, it's because it is!</p>\n<p>Sometimes your score won't calculate properly if you retry after forfeiting from the menu. If that sounds unfair, it's because it is!</p><p><strong>If the game seems frozen\u00a0after using \"forfeit\" press the escape key. The lazy dev probably forgot to check a flag that unpauses the game when Unity switches scenes. They will be reprimanded. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Basically everything: Justen Brown (@jaybee_tyn)</p>\n<p>Fart and crowd sound effects:\u00a0Freesounds</p>\n<p>Music shamefully stolen from the source</p>\n<p>Various textures: Wikimedia Commons and public domain images<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T09:43:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed4ad2c3d73c7c2ed38c721fb68e86b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jaybee"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
