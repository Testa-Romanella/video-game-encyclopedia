It also received a small amount of polish and bug fixes in the 5 days following the event.</p><p>The theme for PTBO Game Jam 01 was \"<strong>Cats On Leashes</strong>\".  This game depicts an alternate universe where cats are <em>not</em> on leashes.  The ramifications are truly terrifying as you can witness by playing the game.</p><p>Defend your flower gardens by operating a state-of-the-art, mechanized, cat-deterring, high-velocity sprinkler system.  Spray water on the cats to score points and annoy them.  Cats will leave the garden if you keep annoying them.</p><p>The game ends once all your flowers are destroyed by cats.  Your final score will then be displayed.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Use the <strong>mouse to aim</strong> the sprinkler system.</p><p>Press the left <strong>mouse button to spray</strong> high-velocity water towards the cats.</p><p><strong>Web Version</strong></p><p>Play at lazymammal.com/cats</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b2/4b214073ca70c0476846990e5cf75bf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["LazyMammal"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
