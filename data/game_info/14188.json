Arrange and combine lavishly illustrated panels, each one a separate interactive window into a living game world. Navigate the scene inside each panel. Align the images in adjacent panels. Solve puzzles and advance the story by stacking and connecting panels. Imagine pictures on a wall escaping their frames and joining together to create new impossible scenes. Elegantly simple and yet astonishing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-06T03:03:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3e7/3e70b112ae2f814b105552dfea7c16dd.jpg", "website": "http://gorogoa.com", "rating": 4.34, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 63, "owned": 960, "beaten": 391, "toplay": 122, "dropped": 41, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 70, "ratings_count": 397, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 406, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "Android", "macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Annapurna Interactive", "Buried Signal", "Jason Roberts"], "genres": ["Casual", "Family", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Annapurna Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
