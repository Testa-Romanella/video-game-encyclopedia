As they reach the enemy HQ, the enemy health (HP) will decrease by the units attack amount. Win the game by defeating the opponent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 6 unique units, along with 6 unique spells, each that cost reinforcement points (RP) and mana points (MP)\u00a0respectively, that you accrue each turn.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Click on the corresponding unit or spell buttons to use (if you have enough RP or MP). Hovering over buttons will provide additional information.</p>\n<p>Hovering over spawned units will also provide individual information about that respective unit, such as current HP.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Tiny Topdown Tileset by PondGames\u00a0https://pondgames.itch.io/ttt-series-rocky-grassland</p>\n<p>16x16 Dungeon Tileset by 0x72\u00a0https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset</p>\n<p>Pixel Art Fire Ball by Matheus Frantz\u00a0https://msfrantz.itch.io/free-fire-ball-pixel-art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T05:48:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d92de96e0060b9d3363f6f4bc193e287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MalosoCreations"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
