The original team was as follows:<br/></p><ul><li>Project Lead<strong>:</strong> Julien Deville</li><li>Lead developer<strong>: </strong>William Dyce</li><li>Developers<strong>: </strong>Maxime Ailloud, Alex Verbrugghe</li><li>Artistic Director<strong>: </strong>Ga\u00eblle Rouby</li><li>Graphic artists<strong>: </strong>Jules Bacon, Stephanie Bottex, Caroline Vic</li></ul><p>I've continued the project, adding a layer of polish and some feedback improvements, as well as gameplay tweaks. Also gamepad support, multi-resolution support, highscore, giblets, screen-shake, all that jazz. Unfortunately I'm not good enough an artist to emulate Ga\u00eblle so I couldn't add any content to speak of. I've provided a link to the original jam version so you can see the difference a bit of sleep and some non-pizza foodstuff makes.</p><p>Please get in touch if you have links to these fine peoples' portfolios - I will add them forthwith! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e512e5acb7b8dcfcdbabf23be61ce1ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["wilbefast"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
