And your only way out is to break the blocks of ice with a paddle and ball. As you play, you will discover new areas of the ice cave. Within each area are a variety of different ice blocks that you must break in order to escape. But be careful not to let your ball get past you as you only have a limited number of lives.\u00a0You may also encounter something that doesn't want you to leave.</p>\n<p>Snowbank Breaker is a simple 2D game where you control a paddle to bounce a ball at the ice blocks above. Once each breakable ice block on screen is broken, you may move on to the next level. NOTE: Not all ice blocks are breakable.
