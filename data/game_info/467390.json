Anything else may change in the future. You need to survive as many waves of squares  as possible, but everytime you do so, something in the gameplay changes. You could forget how to move, or you could become\u00a0 uncontrolably fast. As the number of waves you survived goes up\u00a0, the number of enemies grows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But fear not! If you ever find yourself in a tricky situation look out for these :</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>These Power-Ups can help you get temporarly stronger for one wave of enemies and increase your total score. However they are pretty rare so be sure not to waste them.</p>\r\nGOOD LUCK, YOU'LL NEED IT!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:18:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84eecbe76d97f59c78d21a7ce52e1f1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Psonbre", "Philou213"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
