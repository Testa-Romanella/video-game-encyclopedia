This game is a compilation of the original Robot Wants games from 2010:\u00a0<strong>Robot Wants Kitty, Robot Wants Puppy, Robot Wants Fishy</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>Robot Wants Ice Cream</strong>. In addition, it includes\u00a0<strong>Robot Wants Y!?</strong>, a mini-game that was actually the main banner on the JayIsGames website for a while. And of course, Robot wouldn't be wanting it all if we didn't add\u00a0<strong>Robot Wants Justice</strong>, a\u00a0<em>brand new</em>\u00a0Robot adventure!</p>\n<p><strong>Robot Wants</strong>\u00a0pioneered the \"mini-metroidvania\" concept - an adventure you play through over an hour or less, collecting the powerups you need to go from zero to Kitty along the way. And all with a clock ticking - speedruns are the goal!</p>\n<p>Each of the included games includes 2 alternate maps (an \"Easy\" map, which sometimes is not so easy, but we guarantee it is short! And a \"Remix\" map, which is never easy, or quick), and there are also 12 Mutators which allow you to transform the way the game plays in a variety of helpful and horrible ways.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The ultimate Metroidvania action - you can't even\u00a0<em>JUMP</em>\u00a0without first finding a power-up in some of these games.</li><li>A massive shop full of features and game modes to unlock as you play (with space money, not real money.
