That's it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:\u00a0This was a game meant for me to learn how to use a game engine so I can make\u00a0the games I want to. This includes doing everything that goes into the game so I can get a basic knowledge\u00a0of how to do everything. This especially helps for future projects, making it easier for me to communicate my needs, for those developing with me.\u00a0For other projects, I'm getting others to do what I can't do well or at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game isn't complete or the most balanced, optimized,\u00a0or enjoyable. Honestly, I\u00a0don't expect it to run very nicely. I'm not experienced with optimization and anything I tried made the game either run worse or look terrible, also due to my lack of experience.\u00a0While working on other games, I want to work on this game more, but it\u00a0depends on how things go with those projects. Any time you spend playing my\u00a0little game, I hope you enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move - WASD</p>\n<p>Jump - Space</p>\n<p>Sprint - Shift</p>\n<p>Pause - Escape</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T05:20:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e44/e44b4143f40615839ed77a957fd96303.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bennnperson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
