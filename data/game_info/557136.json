You play as Markenzie, an alcoholic pilot who crashes into a snowy wilderness. You must keep warm in the cabin by gathering sticks long enough until rescue comes to help you. (the current win state is set to survive for 5 minutes -- please comment on how feasible this is)<br/></p>\n<p>This project was a made in approximately 30 days as part of my ongoing 2021 challenge of making a game each month. There are a lot of features which were cut due to limiting the scope to meet the deadlines, and will be implemented at a further date to be determined. Certain features such as an introduction to the main character, and all my voice lines were not included in this build.<br/><br/>I would appreciate any comments, feedback and criticisms about the game, especially based around the current game mechanics in regards to difficulty of the game, if the win state is achievable, or anything else.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T08:35:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3e8b5ad5e29c521d1829d157d98f426.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["syntaxless"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
