The gauges at the bottom of the screen represent the control capacity of both ships: anything you do (as well as taking damage) depletes your gauge, and you lose the game if your control over the KNiGHT drops to zero. Your objective is to reduce the DRAGoN's control to zero by either outmaneuvering or damaging it with your attacks.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Accelerate/decelerate/turn left/right: WASD or Arrow keys<br/>Attack: Space or LMB<br/>Exit: Escape; reload: R; take screenshot: P</p>\n<p><strong>Attributions</strong>:<br/>All code and visual assets have been produced by me, Koveras.<br/>Royalty free sound snippets are courtesy of\u00a0https://www.freesoundeffects.com/, https://www.videvo.net/, and https://www.theforce.net/.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97a/97acea81d5bd508eebefec449833bdea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Koveras"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
