The switches' places are changing from game to game, so you can play with game multiple times. The impediments can decrease your health and can kill you. <br/>\r\nIt's a bit mixture of a maze game and the first level is a little bit of platformer game. <br/>\r\n(My first little game to get an overview about game development and release processes.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T03:24:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f08/f08e2ad9582500a346d6a4bec32938f8.jpg", "website": "http://www.keycube.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Kaarel Kirsipuu", "3dreals"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kaarel Kirsipuu", "3dreals"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
