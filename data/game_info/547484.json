You can\u2019t just walk in and take the item, but\u00a0 will have to sneak through the vents to get where you want to go. Not all vents are connected to each other, and not all rooms are easily accessible, so you'll have\u00a0to go in and out of the vents to find your way through the museum.</p>\n<p>The problem? The entire museum was designed by an artist. This includes the vent layout, where the artist took some\u2026 artistic freedom. It\u2019s basically a maze.</p>\n<p>Oh, and you weren\u2019t actually told what you are supposed to steal. Just that \u201cyou\u2019ll know when you see it\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Keyboard/Mouse</strong><strong>Controller</strong>Character MovementASDWLeft StickCamera MovementMouseRight StickJumpSpacebarACrouchLeft CtrlLeft TriggerToggle First/Third-Person CameraVYPause GameEscapeStartInteractEX", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T08:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/722/722ce02f8bc4eeda682f979d4ca9c2cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tim Rademaker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
