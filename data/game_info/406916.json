The theme was \"Intentional Bugs\". Game made with Godot 3.0 (first with this engine).\r\nYou should not read the following if you want to discover the intentional bugs by yourself (greatly advised!).\r\nFirst bug : You can walk on other enemies without dying, the enemy will then be considered as part of your ship, but his AI will still work, he will keep shooting. It makes the game more interesting as you can use it shoot on enemies, but also more challenging as you have to be careful not to shoot the fortress.\r\nSecond bug: Try pressing space and a direction key at the same time. It will move you forward, then shoot, for only one point of energy!\r\nAll other bugs aren't intentional...\r\nEnjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T05:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c10/c102ce65586a9392dfba563248a57e96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Darenn Keller"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
