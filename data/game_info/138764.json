And then there was Earth, a frozen rock floating around in empty space! And then Sun, being lonely, shined on Earth which created Life. Life started worshipping Sun, which made Sun happy. Happy Sun shined brighter and brighter, warming the Earth. Earth, noticing it was getting warmer and warmer, knew it had to act. Earth created You and Him to stop Sun from getting too happy but at the same time keep him just happy enough so Earth could enjoy a healthy amount of Sun. And so the 'Ritual Of Just Enough Worship' was created, an endless cycle of turning Life into happy Worshippers or unclean Heathens. (ps, heathens and other features might not be implemented)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d71/d71e070d2b25300a339227635840b8fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcel303"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
