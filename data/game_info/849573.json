While drinking coffee she regains lost energy and becomes fast, electric and out of control, running and jumping great distances.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The game's hook consists of knowing how to balance these two gameplay states, alternating between the tired, slow and accurate state and the caffeinated, fast and uncontrolled state. Each has its perks and downfalls that should be used with caution.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The Flow consists of learning different ways to use these mechanics, and performing different combinations and maneuvers of them as required by the levels. Each level explores a new mechanic or a different combination of the ones that have already been introduced. The player engages when feeling challenged and if he dies he is quickly reborn, decreasing frustration.</p>\n\r\nMeet the Team:\n\n<p>Programmer:</p>\n<p>Mateus de Bomfim Marcelino - https://mateusbomfim.itch.io/<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Programming assistant:</p>\n<p>Israel Tavares Ribeiro - https://israboy.itch.io/<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Producer:</p>\n<p>Giovanni da Silva Mariano - https://linktr.ee/gio_gamedev<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Game Designer/Level Designer:</p>\n<p>Julia Wojtowicz Sigwalt- https://linklist.bio/julia_wojtowicz_portfolio<br/></p>\n\n<p>Artis:</p>\n<p>Lucas das Neves Santos - https://nevesart.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T05:49:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a14/a14f38cae8004453aa7679b1c9d69f1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MateusBomfim"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
