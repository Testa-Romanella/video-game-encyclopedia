{"id": 663415, "slug": "dropped-marble", "name": "Dropped Marble", "name_original": "Dropped Marble", "description": "<p><strong>Dropped Marble</strong> is a simple physics-based platformer that will test your skills. Push, spin,\u00a0 jump, and fly your marble across moving, tilting, slippery and springy blocks\u00a0to get to the golden finish. Once you've completed a course, master it and complete it in the fastest time possible.</p>\n<p>If you need some competition, invite your friends to play with you over LAN (Hamachi works great) and see who wins! Or just sabotage each other, that's always fun too.<br/></p>\n<p>If platforming isn't your thing, try out the <strong>Hungry Marble </strong>modes, where you eat smaller balls to grow larger. But watch out! Other balls can and will eat you to grow themselves. It's great with friends or just single player.</p>\n<p>If you enjoy the game and want to give any feedback or talk to me, join me in the game's discord server at\u00a0https://discord.gg/VfacXv7p!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:39:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bd/8bd17e2029f8e071f8fcb07f1a1fc09b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wraithghost2736"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
