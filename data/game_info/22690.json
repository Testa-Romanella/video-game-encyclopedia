Set against the historical backdrop of maritime trade at the time of the Hanseatic League, the Patrician series sees the player take the role of a citizen of a medieval hanseatic town in Northern Europe, between London and Novgorod, with the aim being to rise from the status of an ordinary, unimportant trader to that of a major business tycoon and governor of your hometown.<br/><br/>To achieve this goal, the player must gain the respect and recognition of other inhabitants and try to make a profit through maritime trade, the production of goods and the completion of missions. The player can raise his profile by both improving the city and through diplomacy, or by raising money for his treasury by means of piracy and smuggling - but watch out, others want easy money too, so you would do wise to arm your ships!A realistic simulation of a complex world comprised of production, transport, trade and consumption\nA mix of genres including trade, economics, sea battles and diplomacy\nDetailed and historically accurate graphics", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe35c30d39ef66b1fe7521790d64ac1_Nf08ztL.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 450, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ASCARON Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Kalypso Media"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
