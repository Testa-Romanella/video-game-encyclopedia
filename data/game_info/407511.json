Build towers and clear lines. Control using the keyboard. Arrow keys move the blocks, up arrow or Z and X rotate the blocks. Q pauses and/or exits the game.</p>\n<p>Features:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Classic Tetris Gameplay</strong>\u00a0 - A fairly faithful rendition of the gameplay of the\u00a0Game Boy version of Tetris, including both A and B-type games.</li><li><strong>High score tracking</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0Try to beat your personal best!</li><li><strong>Tiny, unobtrusive graphics</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Micro Mode</strong>\u00a0- The game only occupies a fraction of your\u00a0screen real estate, and can even be displayed in half size on high DPI displays, making it perfect for discreetly playing at work or while watching something on your computer.</li></ul>\n<p>Currently I only release mac binaries, as that's the only platform I play these games on. There is no reason why they should not work on other platforms however. They are written in Rust and have a dependency on C libraries SDL2 and SDL_gfx. I don't think there would be any issues compiling for Linux or Windows, but I can't support those platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T04:01:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81e/81ea59c28dfa90b29fdc4898a54f410f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Liam O'Connor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
