But don't poke and prod at the objects too much! Each inspection method can cause damage to the object, putting Inspector Baggage's job in danger should he damage innocent cargo too much.</p>\n<p>Try to survive on limited clues and take your chances to avoid being blown up, poisoned, assassinated, maimed etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When a package arrives in view of the conveyor belt, click a tool to asset the Inspector's face. Their facial reaction will tell you whether the package is safe or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, most tools will do damage to the package and too much damage will cause loss of score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At any time, you can reject or accept the package to continue onwards. Keep playing until time runs out.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>The Anger (Michael) - Lead Game Developer<br/></p>\n<p>AkariZero (Jim) - Game Director, Developer<br/></p>\n<p>J-Dawgeus (Jenz) - Lead Artist, Developer</p>\n<p>Cam - Artist, Developer<br/></p>\n<p>MJ - Game Writer/Social Media</p>\n\n<p>RoboSlab Font by Google Fonts<br/></p>\n<p>\"Hard Boiled\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:51:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2b9fc10161f2dd2bfffce8a92eb4dee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AkariZero", "caelifera", "J-Dawgeus", "MJ Vradenburg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
