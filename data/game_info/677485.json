Common strategies for gender-inclusive language involve things like using an asterisk, underscore, colon etc. (e.g. Spieler*innen) for gendered nouns. However, these can present accessibility issues for people using screen-readers, people suffering from dyslexia and others (see references). Instead of using such methods, we avoided gendered nouns entirely, e.g. translating players as \"Spielende\",\u00a0\"Beteiligte\", \"Spielrunde\", \"Gruppe\" etc, and using \"Person\" to refer to individuals.<br/><em>\"Triggers\"</em> \u2013 We avoided the term \"trigger\" in the translation, as it is now frequently misused and far removed from its original, very specific context. Instead we refer to themes/content which can bring up\u00a0traumatic events/memories.<br/><em>Form of address</em> \u2013 Since this is all about inclusivity and being welcoming, we used casual \"du\" rather than formal \"Sie\" to address the readers.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Changes to the source<br/></strong><em>The colour\u00a0</em>\u2013 Yellow is a very attention-grabbing colour, and there's nothing wrong with that, but for our version, we're using a calm blue instead. In colour psychology, blue is considered a soothing colour. However, the cards remain yellow, as we do want them to command attention when used during a session (the text on them\u00a0is localised).<br/><em>Errata\u00a0</em>\u2013 Section 6 (Deploying Script Changes) refers to\u00a0<em>Highlight Reel</em>,\u00a0<em>Instant Replay </em>and <em>Wrap Meeting\u00a0</em>as being detailed in the next section. However, section 7 actually covers\u00a0<em>Highlight Reel</em>,\u00a0<em>Wrap Meeting\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Bloopers &amp; Outtakes</em>. In the translation, we therefore refer to <em>Bloopers &amp; Outtakes</em> at this point, rather than <em>Instant Replay </em>(which is covered in Section 5).<br/><em>Rejuggle</em> \u2013 In the original, folding along the dotted line would have either left Squicks visible while hiding Icks and the warning sentence, or hidden Squicks, Icks AND the warning sentence. We rearranged the element so that Icks and Squicks are under the fold, and the warning line above it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>References and Research</strong><br/>We found a few resources online where safety techniques for roleplaying settings are discussed.
