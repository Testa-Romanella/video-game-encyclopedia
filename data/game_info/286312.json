The current demo could be described as a vertical slice of what is to come should I continue with the project. It currently<br/></p>\n<p><strong>features:</strong><br/>- Six different characters (not in looks though), each with their own stats, attacks and abilities. You'll also need to unlock half of them!<br/>- Six different enemy types with a few sub-types. Yes, they're all re-colors of the same sprite.<br/>- A world map with what would constitute a \"world's\" or \"zone's\" amount of content.<br/>- A final boss awaiting at the final level. Some characters perform far better against him than others though.<br/>- An unending arcade mode once you're done with the main levels (you'll also have to unlock it). The algorithm will sometimes generate *really* annoying enemy waves.<br/>- Controller (xinput) support at a basically proof-of-concept stage. It's rough, but it works.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell me:</strong><br/>- What you think! I'd love some feedback on stuff like: character balance, game performance, enemy behavior, or just about anything else that comes to mind!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T04:03:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd7/bd75b26f77fa5003453d1308b6158f17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sinis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
