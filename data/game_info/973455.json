Be my harbinger, and you shall be rewarded with miracles!</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>Phantoms</strong> is a first-person horror game that takes place on a strange train. You're on route to see your old friend Floyd, but all of a sudden, you sense something's not quite right. What was a simple, relaxing train ride mere moments ago, transforms into a hunting ground in a blink of an eye... and you're the prey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game takes inspiration from retro PlayStation\u2122 graphics and aesthetics, combined with analogue horror and a hint of eldritch mystery. No two levels ever play the same as the layout of the train, and the items you need to collect, are randomized every time. <strong>Phantoms</strong> offers five story levels (the final one being hidden in conjunction with the secret ending), a custom level mode and two potential endings to the story.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T03:58:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a2/4a2fba28b7e73e6b7ac9a23bf4b614d8.jpg", "website": "https://phantomsgame.wordpress.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solitude Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Solitude Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
