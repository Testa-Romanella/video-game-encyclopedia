The one submitted misses 2 levels which were made before the deadline.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rUWQOFFYxgY25jsxjttUorr6BUMvCS8P/view?usp=shari...<br/><br/>You are facing the biggest obstacle on your path to a beautiful career as a Button Pressing Specialist - a job interview. You have been put through countless tests and evaluations and finally you are allowed to approach the final challenge. The task is simple: Make sure the test robots survive, by pressing correct buttons. Simple, right? Well, you never know when something goes out of control.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>Left mouse click to smash your fist down. If you manage to hit a button, it will become pressed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is a bug in the submitted file, which doesn't allow to progress after finishing a level. The simplest solution is to restart the game and a new level will be unlocked in the main menu. Couldn't fix it after the deadline, so it has to stay.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:41:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c612a6e03a88a38e26cc79e8e9d813ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScurvyRat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
