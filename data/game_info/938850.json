One player must use turrets and building blocks to protect their tower from incoming enemy waves, while the other player strategically places enemies and blocks to try and take down the tower. With each round, the roles switch, and the game becomes a battle of wits to see who can outsmart and outmaneuver their opponent to ultimately take down their tower. Will you defend your tower with all your might, or will you be the one to take it down in a hail of enemy fire? It's time to find out in Tower Takedown.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game is a \"Couch Co-Op\", meaning that it is played on the same device! And made to do so.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T13:49:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6f/d6f09e599f6e94740183467feb26aafc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BoxDudeDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
