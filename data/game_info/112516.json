VR (ALPHA)", "description": "<p>Thank you for testing my new game!<br/></p>\n<p>I've been working pretty hard on the beat detection and reader.<br/>In this game you will be able to input any of your own music! (.mp3s, .wavs, and .oggs)<br/>Then choose one of three different game modes! (Slasher, Dodger, or Shooter)</p>\n<p>I need some feedback on the beat detection and the design overall, but keep in mind:<br/>This is a very early build! It has no in game menus, it will just throw you right into the 'Slasher' mode with preset songs.<br/>I removed everything else because it is not finished and isn't needed at this point. I only have a Windows Mixed Reality headset.<br/>That in mind, I think it will work just fine with the HTC Vive, but I am not sure about oculus. Please let me know if it works for<br/>either of those. EXPECT LITTLE BUGS.</p>\n<p>SONG LIST:<br/>Belong - Cash Cash<br/>Decoy World VIP - INTERCOM<br/>Final Smash - MDK<br/>Fortress - Rogue<br/>Rock it - Toyko Machine<br/>Seven Nation Army (The Glitch Mob Remix)<br/>The Middle - Zedd<br/>100 Bills - Jaroslav Beck &lt;--- this is the song from the 'Beat Saber' trailer (more about that below in the 'Feedback' section)</p>\n<p>I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO ANY OF THESE SONGS!</p>\n<p>There are TWO BUILDS:<br/>Dynamic Speed : Beats will come at a speed corrisponding with the song intensity (My favorite)<br/>Static Speed : Beats will come at a single speed with no changes</p>\n<p>Both are gonna be an option in the final game, I just want to know which one people like better</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Hit the beats with the corrisponding sword based on the colors (red or blue).<br/>It does not matter in what direction you will hit it from (However that will be added later as an option)<br/>You don't have to worry about cutting through a blue to get to a red or being marked down for it. The game doesn't care if you cut through<br/>a blue to get to a red, but the blue will not go away when you do this unless you also cut it with the blue sword. The game does<br/>keep track of your swinging, so if you spam swinging, you will lose your combo and multiplier. Also, make sure you are swinging<br/>pretty hard because the game will not count a wimpy swing.</p>\n<p>Press both menu buttons to recenter yourself<br/>Press both touchpads in to skip a song (It will randomize it as you hold)</p>\n<p>Gameplay:<br/>You will see a HUD in the game when looking through the VR Headset. It has:<br/>Score : the score of the current song (1 beat cut addes the 'multiplier' to your score)<br/>Combo : how many beats did you cut in a row<br/>Multiplier : a longer combo will give you a higher multiplier<br/>Dots : These show how many swings you have left until you loose your combo, you have a set for each sword, and they reset<br/>when you hit one of the corrisponding beats!</p>\n<p>Feedback:<br/>Please let me know what you think! I know there is a VR game coming out called, \"Beat Saber,\" and that this is very similar, but<br/>this game will be different in many ways:<br/>It will have multiple game modes, not just 'Slasher'<br/>You can use your own music because it is procedually generated (Beat Saber only has premade songs I do beleive, but I'm not sure)<br/>Multiple maps all with customization<br/>Will, MAX, only be $15 when finished. (or if 'Beat Saber' is $15 or less, then $5 less than whatever 'Beat Saber' is) \"MARKETING\" ;)</p>\n<p>Please email me at: \"KFriskeStudios@gmail.com\" with your feedback or<br/>post a reply on the reddit post or on my old game's steam news post</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/19822617c75b0ec08bbc31db40164812.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KFriskeStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
