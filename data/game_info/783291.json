Fight alongside your monster friends in deep, real-time strategic combat, and hop on their backs to explore and collect in the whimsical world of Never Everland.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Fairy Tale Monsters</strong></p>\n<p>In Grimmlins Tale, all monsters are inspired by a fairy tale and characters within them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here we have Froggold, a water type based on The Frog Prince.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Howlhuff, a wind type based on Little Red Riding Hood and The Big Bad Wolf</p>\n\n<p>Gremlidge, a life and earth type based on the bridge troll in Billy Goat's Gruff<br/><br/></p>\n<p>These creatures are going to help you along your journey. In grimmlins, your partners can be out and interact with you and the world totally fluidly. In Never Everland, the setting of the game, the world plays out almost like a predetermined play. All grimmlins live in a magical loop of fate where certain events will ALWAYS happen to them regardless of what they do. This is all done by an entity known as \"The Director\" who makes their lives play out in a way that echoes the stories they emulate from our world. In this way, grimmlins have no free choice, unless you save them from this fate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Catch and Train!</strong></p>\n<p>Grimmlins is a lot of things, and one of those things is an rpg with lots of room for growth and player expression in their grimmlin and team building</p>\n<ul><li>Catch any and all of the more than 60 fully fleshed out and deep monsters from your favorite fairy tales</li><li>Train them to get stronger with a variety of customizable systems including equippable cooldown moves, equippable static abilities, and directly choosing stat investments each level!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Command Them in Real Time!</strong></p>\n<p>Grimmlins Tale offers a deep strategic control system over your monsters while allowing you to use multiple monsters at once.</p>\n<ul><li>Order your grimmlins where to position and who they should attack</li><li>Activate and aim a variety of equippable cooldowns on each grimmlin</li><li>Command multiple grimmlins at once with up to 5 grimmlins on each team in some battles!
