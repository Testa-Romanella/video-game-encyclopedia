The game currently features 4 playable characters, 1 stage, and two game modes. Keyboard input is supported, but the game was really designed with controllers in mind.</p>\n<p><em><strong>why is it scrapped?</strong></em></p>\n<p>This game was <em>way </em>more work than I expected. By the time I reached where I am now, I was burnt out and tired of working on it. So I've decided to put it out there in it's current state, and work on something else. I plan on returning to it one day, but for now I hope people can get a kick out of it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>keyboard controls:</strong></em></p>\n<ul><li>W/A/S/D - Move</li><li>J - Jump</li><li>I - Attack</li><li>O - Special Attack</li><li>K - Switch palette</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>gamepad\u00a0controls:<br/></em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left Stick/Dpad - Move</li><li>A - Jump</li><li>X - Attack</li><li>B - Special Attack</li><li>Y - Switch Palette</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T05:49:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ab/2ab3a63d01064bb8b6b09c4d743221b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sciman101"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
