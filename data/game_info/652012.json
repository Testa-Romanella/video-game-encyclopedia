I originally released this game in August 1993.</p>\n<p>Firefly is two games in one: a top top shooter with some simple weapons, and a race game. It has no relation to my later PC game Firefly (2003), this\u00a0game was inspired by\u00a0Salamander on the C64, and an ancient tunnel race\u00a0game I programmed on Dragon 32.\u00a0 Perhaps the most notable thing about Firefly is the music. The main theme tune, Trax, was later re-recorded\u00a0and released on my album Bites of Greatness.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/102d09fdceba428e3927440ae0c836a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
