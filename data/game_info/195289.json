The play is as addictive as any Zombie, Flappy Bird or snarky pig killing game, but better for your brain and your soul(you aren't killing a masterpiece, you are restoring it).<br/><br/>Puzzle Brain Break - Monet is satisfyingly difficult. Your brain really does get exercised. Even the \"Easy\" level is deliciously challenging.<br/><br/>It works like this: first the masterpiece is converted to a grid with 3 rows of 3 pieces(Easy), 4 rows of 4 pieces(Moderate), or 5 rows of 5 pieces(Hard). Then it scrambles the pieces and removes one. Your job is to move a piece that is adjacent to the blank square into the blank square, then repeat until you have re-assembled the masterpiece.</p><p>Sound easy? Think again. Unless you are way smarter than us or a Rubik's Cube champion, your brain WILL sweat. In point of fact, a Rubik's Cube is the best game to compare Puzzle Brain Break - Monet to. Think of a one sided impressionistic Rubik's Cube.<br/><br/>One more thing. It's cheating to have your genius kids figure it out for you.<br/><br/>With 4 puzzles, think of Puzzle Brain Break - Monet giving you 4 sets of 3 progressively harder reps of brain exercise on your phone or tablet whenever you blunder into a boring situation or just need a brain break. And it's free!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6f/d6f987d5533eb558435ac79b67414e50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scottsgr"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
