You must destroy all the spiders and sacrifice them at the altars. Attack with your dagger by holding left click; you cannot move when attacking. Attack with magic by clicking right click. Toggle your magic spells by pressing 1, 2, and 3. Collect magic mana by picking up mushrooms. Spiders can only be sacrificed to the corresponding altar. (The bigger the altar, the higher the level.) Level 1 spiders are blue with orange, level 2 spiders are green with yellow, level 3 spiders are red, and level 4 spiders are silver with red spots. You can use WASD to move, and LEFT SHIFT to pick up dead spiders and bring them to altars. Good luck, and enjoy our game!</p>\n<p><strong>Art credits</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Sylvia</strong>: Universal LPC Spritesheet Character Generator<ul><li>Author list</li></ul></li><li><strong>Spiders</strong>:\u00a0[LPC] Spider<ul><li>by\u00a0Stephen Challener (Redshrike) and\u00a0William Thompson (William.Thompsonj)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Altar mist</strong>: Smoke Aura<ul><li>by Beast</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fc/4fc7bb3e39d2dd4dfcae0d9cc3a221c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mertios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
