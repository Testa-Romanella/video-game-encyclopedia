The infamous forest of Dunkelwald is home to a vile Creature of the Night known to the locals as the H\u00f6gl. The creature that inhabits this forest is not the only sinister thing about this place, during the second world war, it was used to store gruesome weapons, and was used to test experimental weapons of mass destruction. The houses and huts of this forest have therefore been home to many victims of the great war, and this is where you come in. After many years have passed you have returned to the horrid Dunkelwald, to retrieve 5 dogtags of your fallen breathen. As you seach for the last remnants of your long lost companions, you find yourself not as alone as you might have thought...<br/><br/>Note:\u00a0<br/>1.
