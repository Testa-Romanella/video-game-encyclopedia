The ship can be quite challenging to navigate, and you might find yourself in the same room<br/>over and over again...But we're confident that you'll be able to figure it out!</p>\n<p>Best of luck.<br/>--------------------------------------------<br/>Escape. Where? Is a first-person puzzle game, where your objective is to escape a crashing spacecraft.<br/>The task becomes more challenging when you realize that the layout seems to make absolutely no sense, with<br/>rooms you just left behind appearing right in front of you. Navigate the ship, find the passcode, and escape.<br/>Oh, and I guess you can also complete the tasks to help out your fellow crewmates.</p>\n<p>=============================<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming: MrWhimble, Kitiliisu<br/>Modeling: MrWhimble, Kitiliisu<br/>Art: Kitiliisu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:43:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/572db1596bbb867cceac967e38466bfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mrwhimble"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
