This is my entry for the Untitled Game Jam #27.<br/></p>\n<p>It's a boss battle arena game where you face off against a bunch of bosses in a row until you reach the end. They're quite varied (and quite hard) so I that you get some enjoyment out of the experience!<br/></p>\n<p>The game has no real storyline but there's a little tidbit at the bottom of the description  if you want to know what's going on in-universe.</p>\n<p>~~~<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move the character up, down, left and right.</p>\n<p>SPACE - Dash, increases the player's base speed for a short time allowing them to dodge attacks, move away from the enemy, etc.</p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK - Swings a sword, you can swing the sword again as soon as it disappears.</p>\n<p>RIGHT CLICK - Fires an arrow from a bow. If you hold down right click, the damage increases, although the player moves at half speed for the duration.<br/></p>\n<p>~~~<br/></p>\n<p>CREDIT TO:</p>\n<p>https://beepyeah.itch.io/8-bit-sfx-pack\u00a0- various sound effects in the game.</p>\n<p>https://ozukamusic.itch.io/snes-original-soundtrack-small-collection\u00a0- background music.<br/></p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>On one ill-fated day, Yara awoke in a stoney chamber with nothing but a sword and a bow on her back. \"Peculiar,\" the girl thought. As she went to retrieve a nearby quiver (with a seemingly endless supply of arrows), a faint *squish* echoed from afar.</p>\n<p>*squish*</p>\n<p>*squISH*</p>\n<p>*SQUISH*</p>\n<p>As she spun with the energy of a rather confused dog wondering if they'd heard their name being called, she laid eyes on a giant gooey green monstrosity which set its malicious gaze upon her. <br/></p>\n<p>\"I don't suppose you know any way out of here?\"</p>\n<p>Although some slimes do possess the ability to talk and are sometimes rather well-spoken and fluent in the human tongue, this one could not. It simply bounced on the spot and replied with a *squish*.</p>\n<p>Yara, uneducated in the science of slime social anthropology, took the Slime's (lack of) response as the silent treatment.<br/></p>\n<p>\"Well, that's a bit rude.\"</p>\n<p>And then they tried to kill eachother.<br/></p>\n<p>~~~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:42:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f95c22b52fb3e98e4899c77fb4270952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DreamSequence"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
