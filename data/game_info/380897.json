The choice of strategy at decision points during the game isn't always trivial, which keeps it challenging play after play.<h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li> Six levels ranging from casual to deeply strategic<br/></li><li> More than 10-million unique puzzles<br/></li><li> Every puzzle is winnable<br/></li><li> Three unique daily challenges and one weekly challenge<br/></li><li> Zen and sophisticated art style<br/></li><li> Eleven collectible characters to unlock</li></ul><h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>In Match Solitaire, a standard deck of playing cards is shuffled and dealt into columns.<br/>Like traditional Solitaire, the object of the game is to remove all of the cards from the columns.<br/>But unlike old-school Solitaire, you remove cards by collecting matching sets!<br/>There are only 3 rules to learn in Match Solitaire, and if you've played Solitaire before you probably already know 2 of them.<h3>RULE 1: Stack Cards</h3>You can move any one card from the top of one stack to the top of another stack, as long as you're stacking cards with matching suits in sequence. You can stack cards up, down, or both ways! Values \"wrap\", too, so you can put a King on an Ace or vice-versa! You may move only one card at a time.<h3>RULE 2: Use FreeCells</h3>At the bottom of each stack is a FreeCell, into which you can place any one (and only one) card. Use them wisely!<h3>RULE 3: Collect Matches!</h3>You can collect a complete set of cards with matching values (suit does not matter) and remove them from the board as long as none of the cards in the set are covered by another card.<br/><br/>That's it!
