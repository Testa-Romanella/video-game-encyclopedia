Although the vanilla game has color words such as RED, they only have an aesthetic\u00a0meaning. This levelpack asks: what if you could do something to\u00a0target all red objects? Coded using hidden text, this is enough to explore a lot of unique\u00a0color-related ideas that wouldn't be possible in the maingame (you may accidentally spoil yourself if you look in the editor). Made for the\u00a0One Stage, Many Acts competition.</p>\n<p><em>(The FEELING keyword is like a conditional</em><em>. For example, ALL FEELING YOU IS WIN would give the\u00a0WIN property to all things that have the YOU property.\u00a0Also, \"ALL\" does not include text. The word FEELING was introduced in Baba's official New Adventures pack.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Note: Watch out for red herrings.
