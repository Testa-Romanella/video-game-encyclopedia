I am interested in unraveling the human psyche so I spend a small portion of my free time carrying out bizarre experiments on the human brain. I am a student of psycho-physics (not what I major in but is a small part of what I am learning in my tertiary studies) and have taken up the hobby of learning to use the Unreal Engine to make a video game. Lo and behold, my first game. I am curious and looking forward to find out whether the curse, a result of a creative process that was dark and interesting, of The Succubi Trap is real. I may have taken things a tad too far. <br/><br/><strong>Enjoy</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2b/f2b0f967e738fd910e1a7530ea50b94e.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/cerebraloverloadTST/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cerebraloverload"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["cerebraloverload"], "esrb_rating": null}
