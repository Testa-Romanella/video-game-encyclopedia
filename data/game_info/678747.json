Though I may not have been able to include all of them within this submission, I was able to get to a few of them. Firstly, I managed to add instructions onto the \"Instructions\" section of the main menu. Instead of having to read the description, players should now be able to read them from within the game itself. Next are the mini-bosses, as well as the final boss itself. I will be honest and say that they are simply straight chasers, BUT they have been reskinned with skins made by me personally through the use of the website \"pixilart\". That's really the only difference though. They have different skins, but are much bigger and require much more attacks to take them down. Next are the lives of the player appearing in the bottom-left corner. As I said before, I feel as though the player should be able to see where they stand when it comes to the number of lives they currently hold which may trigger something within them to really focus. I have also added two extra levels. With that also in mind, as you play, you may notice that some of the levels are straightforward while some are a maze. I wanted to make them different and unique in a sense. Not only that, but as the levels progress, the number of enemies increases. If you have also noticed, the main menu screen is no longer the plain UI Backdrop, but instead of the main protagonist itself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now there are some modifications that I didn't get to make to the game. The one being\u00a0 adding power ups. As much as I wish I could have added them, I don't believe I would have had the time to come up with the scripting for each of them in time for the project to be due. I made the design, but seeing as I'm just getting into scripting, it would be difficult to do so. I have watched a few YouTube tutorials on how to possibly do this task, but either I still didn't understand it fully, or it did not match up with what I was working on. Hopefully at some point in time, when I am better skilled at working with Unity and scripting, I can come back and make major updates to the game.</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Creator: Devin Alexander Powell</p>\n<p>Game Engine Used: Unity</p>\n<p>Website Used to Make Mini-Bosses &amp; Final Boss: Pixilart</p>\n\n<p>Created by: Devin Alexander Powell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T04:49:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/82858fcf817c18df5c3d162293289872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["KingDp_217"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
