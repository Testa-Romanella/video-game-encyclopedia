You don't even remember anything... Anyway, let's go see what the city has to offer, it's not like there's anything else to do...</p>\n\n<p>...But it's dark. Something like a power outage. When the thunder strikes, you can see the city. For a brief moment, the power seems to come back, letting you see what's around you.</p>\n\n<p>Memories. This city reminds you something. Maybe there is a meaning in all of this ?</p>\r\nDiscover the true purpose of this place...\r\n\r\n\n\n\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>Anatole Chaumont Frelet</strong> - <em>Code / 3D Art /\u00a0Level Building / Writing</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thomas Lebrun</strong> - <em>Code / 3D Art /\u00a0VFX / Level Building /\u00a0Audio (Music &amp; SFX) / Writing</em></p>\n<p><strong>L\u00e9a Pequignot</strong> - <em>3D Art\u00a0/\u00a0Writing</em></p>\n<p><strong>Paul Godard</strong> - <em>3D Art /\u00a0Level Building / Writing</em></p>\r\nADDITIONAL NOTE\r\n<p>This game is meant to be played entirely in one playthrough, so there isn't any saving feature.
