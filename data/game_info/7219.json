Something like that!<br/><br/>\u201cBlitzKeep combines pinball with a dastardly RPG.\u201d - Pocket Gamer<br/>\u201cThe visuals in the game look gorgeous.\u201d - It\u2019s New<br/>\u201cMy favorite new game release this week.\u201d - App Advice<br/>\u201cI love the freshness of the idea.\u201d - Modern Jamming<br/>\u201cGame of the week.\u201d - Macgasm<br/><br/>Point your hero where you want him to attack, and he won&amp;#39;t stop moving until he&amp;#39;s reached a safe zone or has died! The latter happens far too often... Pick up gear to increase your power, and kill weak enemies first so that you can level up enough to kill the stronger ones. Eventually, you may even become strong enough to kill a massive boss! Don&amp;#39;t be disheartened by frequent deaths - it takes only moments to try again!<br/><br/>***iPhone 5, iPad 3, or better recommended!***<br/><br/>------------------------------------<br/>The Story<br/>------------------------------------<br/>You play as an intrepid hero who is descended from a long line of heroes, and has the blood of the heroes, and is very heroic. Your homeland was taken from you and your kin by the evil Blitz Mage, who used his villainous powers to curse the entire island! The curse says that whoever stands still while in darkness will turn into a monster themselves. Looks like you&amp;#39;ve got no choice but to keep running!<br/><br/>You will travel through 10 kingdoms on your way to the Blitz Keep, where the dastardly Blitz Mage resides. Each kingdom has a king that has been transformed into the most horrible of creatures \u2013 a huge boss monster. Beat the boss to move on to the next land.<br/><br/>The first 5 kingdoms are:<br/>Puddland - Home of the Crustacean Commander<br/>Archeologia - Domain of the Granite Gurkhan<br/>Spookane - Realm of the Ectoplasmic Emperor<br/>Amphibia - Land of the Toadlike Tsar<br/>Impopolis - Kingdom of the Malicious Maharaja<br/><br/>The other 5 kingdoms will be coming soon!<br/><br/>------------------------------------<br/><br/>After you&amp;#39;ve finally struggled through all the kingdoms, can you beat your high score? What about your friends&amp;#39; scores? Compare them on Game Center (more achievements coming with later updates)!<br/><br/>------------------------------------<br/>Help<br/>------------------------------------<br/>The tutorial should get you started. However, there are a few tips from us to you:<br/><br/>\u2022 The secret to winning is taking your time and killing absolutely every enemy you can.<br/>\u2022 You beat enemies by having a &amp;gt;= POW than them. Your POW is inside your sword in the HUD. If you have less, you die!<br/>\u2022 Enemies that are stronger than you will have a small skull above their heads.<br/>\u2022 You can increase your POW either by picking up items with a &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; (meaning they are better than what you&amp;#39;ve got), or by killing weaker enemies to level up. Each time your sword fills with blue you will level up, and as the Knight this will grant you 3 POW.<br/>\u2022 If you start to run out of time too often, go to the Shop and buy some time upgrades! The first few are very cheap.<br/>\u2022 When you collect gold, you keep it, even if you die or restart!<br/>\u2022 Your score for a level is: totalEXP + totalItemPower * 5 \u2013 it&amp;#39;s a direct measure of how strong you are, regardless of the class you selected!<br/>\u2022 Your progress in a level will be used for the next level only if you beat that level with a higher score than the last time you did it.<br/>\u2022 Tap as you hit a wall to boost. You&amp;#39;ll be invincible, will plow through enemies, and will also get a speed bump. Use this to beat enemies that are stronger than you.<br/>\u2022 Swipe while you&amp;#39;re moving to slightly change your direction. You can use this to get yourself out of infinite bounces, or to try to nudge yourself towards things.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/8479dae9b14d3c1bad8bf791f56d2e6d.jpeg", "website": "http://flintgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Flint Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Flint Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
