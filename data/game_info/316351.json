First time releasing a game you can somewhat play - yay!</p>\n<p>It is more like a demo rather than a finished game. You can walk from one room to another, visit a zombie who is following you. A simple \"punch\" animation is implemented but does nothing at all.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD - Walk<br/>N - Action</p>\r\nThe initial idea:\r\n<p>First of all:\u00a0I will continue development.</p>\n<p>You are a poor guy who awakes in a dungeon filled with zombies and other monsters. You are trying to escape using weapons laying around. But beware! Every item you collect will slow you down, so there is a tradeoff between gaining more power with items and loosing walking speed making you less powerful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4f2d5d585f53596efea2b738831c3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lompi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
