Download it at java.com!</strong><br/><br/></p><p>Welcome to Chamber Crawler! This game is a fun arcade/adventure-type game where you will explore every chamber and collect as much gold as possible before you die. Your character moves around in a grid-based system, while the enemies chase you. But you don't have to just run from the enemies: you can fight back. Press space to take out your sword and jab in the direction you are facing. You can hurt enemies and collect chests this way. There's a twist, though: each chamber is randomly generated, although there are some different kinds of chambers, like forest, maze-vertical, maze-horizontal, and empty. In total, there are 1600 open chambers where you can explore and collect gold. Download the .jar file and the font, install the font, open the game, and start playing!</p><p>P.S: This game was made for ProcJam 2016 in 4 days with the Tess2D art pack. Most of the art comes from that pack, which I did not make. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bloobchube"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
