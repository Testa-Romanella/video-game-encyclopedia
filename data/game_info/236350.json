It is based on Steve Reich's works such as <em>Piano Phase </em>and <em>Clapping Music</em>. You don't need any musical knowledge to use it. Just make the music that you like, and let you surprised by how it goes.<br/></p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<ul><li>Choose\u00a0a time signature and a BPM. The time signature determines how many beats there will be in one measure. 4/4 and 3/4 are pretty commons,     while 5/2 and 7/2 are quite odd. BPM means <em>beats per minute</em>, and it determines how fast the music goes (the higher, the faster).</li><li>Create a melody on the sequencer by activating tiles. Use the play button just at the bottom to listen to it. You can also change the tonic and the mode of the scale. If you don't know what that means, don't worry, just select something that sounds pleasant to you.</li><li>Select a tonic and mode for every section of the music. The number of section is determined by the signature. You can jump on a section to directly edit it on the sequencer. But you don't need to think too much about it: choosing random tonic and scales can give delightful results too!</li><li>Hit the <em>Start</em> button to listen to the entire song. You can still edit it while it's playing.</li></ul>\r\nWhat is \u201cphasing\u201d?\r\n<p>You might have start the song, and wondered \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d.<br/></p>\n<p>Well, this is phasing music. A minimalist technique created by the composer Steve Reich. Basically, a short melody is played and repeated by two instruments . Except that one of the two plays a little bit faster! This makes them get out of sync, creating new emerging patterns.</p>\n<p>Here, at each section (which last 4 measures), the second instrument is \u201cmoved to the left\u201d. Or more specifically: it plays one beat early. You can see on the sequencer that your melody is still there, but it is also shifted elsewhere. At each new section, additional notes move one beat to the left. And this is repeated until the two melodies merge again.</p>\r\nImport / Export\r\n<p>So far you can only export your music as a hash code. Use it to share your creations!<br/></p>\n<p>By copy-pasting hash codes in the <em>Import</em> field, you can load songs, and edit them if you want to.</p>\n<p>In the future, I plan to export songs into MIDI files. This way you might be able to use it in a music software to create a composition on top of it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db85db664eb8fbc2a7a7c55c0666c20e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itooh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
