It was entered<br/>into the PUR-80 category of the Basic 10Liner Contest 2021:<br/>https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/games-list-2021</p>\n<p>The game features complete gameplay with large colourful tiles.<br/>sounds effects.</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS<br/>------------<br/>Sokoban is a puzzle video game genre in which the player pushes<br/>diamonds around in a warehouse, trying to get them to marked<br/>storage locations.</p>\n<p>You move the player tile with the a,s,w and d keys. If you need<br/>to restart you push run/stop (or escape if using an emulator)<br/>and \"run\" the program again.</p>\n\n<p>SOURCE CODE<br/>-----------<br/>The main code is sokoban.txt which contains<br/>comments, and allows the basic lines to be split<br/>across multiple source lines</p>\n<p>The make script uses Unix utilities (tr, sed) to strip<br/>the comments and merge lines from sokoban.txt to produce<br/>a basic source file. This source file is compiled to a<br/>C64 basic program using the petcat utility from the<br/>Vice emulator. petcat is also used to produce a stripped<br/>basic listing in sokoban.bas, which is the same as the one<br/>seen in the C64 (with control codes expanded to text i<br/>equivalents like those used in type-in listings in<br/>Compute!'s Gazette and similar magazines in the 80's).<br/>The script then launches the program using x64, the<br/>Commodore 64 emulator also from the Vice package.</p>\n<p>Feel free to use my make script for your own projects,<br/>and modify it as needed.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T05:59:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/583/583bd3f7233e81a13a156f741aa4eb2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
