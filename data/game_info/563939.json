{"id": 563939, "slug": "copy-editor-free-preview", "name": "Copy Editor: Free Preview", "name_original": "Copy Editor: Free Preview", "description": "<p>Copy Editor is an intricate puzzle game that teaches you Regular Expressions (RegEx), commonly used in computer science and language theory. Build complex rules that process and revise famous texts for your wacky and demanding publishers! Game is soon to release in early alpha but enjoy this free preview for a taste of what's to come.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Using characters, scripts, and sequences, your goal is to align your \u201cInput\u201d with the \u201cObjective.\u201d Like its spiritual predecessor, The Devil's Calculator, no familiarity with the concept is needed. The basics are learned through gentle tutorials, with the focus always on tactics and lateral thinking. While you will no doubt learn valuable RegEx skills, the fun of Copy Editor lies in its sophisticated and rewarding logic puzzles. You must navigate playful obstructions such as a limited number of rules, certain keyboard keys not working for particular levels, and an embellishment of RegEx that extends to Natural Language Processing allowing you to discriminate on criteria like sentiment analysis, stems and parts of speech.</p>\n<p>Optimization is a big part of Copy Editor, and you can see how well you stack up to others with detailed breakdowns of your performance. In this way it is similar to RegEx Golf but far more elaborate and nuanced, since text replacement is of equal importance. Confident in your skills? A fully formed level editor will allow you to pose your own challenges to the community.</p>\n<p>Whether you are new to using Regular Expressions or want to test your proficiency, Copy Editor promises a fun and challenging puzzle experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:50:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd9/bd95ad59445bb54958a5b8afdadc3f39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cinq-Mars Media"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
