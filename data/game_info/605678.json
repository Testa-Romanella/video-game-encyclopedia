{"id": 605678, "slug": "no-longer-home", "name": "No Longer Home", "name_original": "No Longer Home", "description": "<p>Bo and Ao are graduating university and preparing to leave the flat they\u2019ve lived in together for a year. Thanks to visa limitations, Ao is forced to return to Japan, leaving Bo in England. Disillusioned by post-educational life and shoved aside by a government who doesn\u2019t want them there, both are trying to come to terms with their uncertain futures. And deep under their South London flat, something grows...<br />\nWander through an intimate flat and examine the everyday belongings of Bo and Ao. Have BBQs, play video games, and stay up late just talking in bed. Follow the day to day activities and conversations of two queer, non-binary students and their friends.  Get to know Lu, the multi-eyed, animal-like new flatmate.<br />\nNo Longer Home was born when the developers were similarly forced apart after university, and decided to stay in touch by working on a game together. Development duo Hana and Cel chose this project as a way to explore and express the emotions that came with saying goodbye.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-18T18:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d63/d63f669f13a9f61c768388957fe9c4cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Humble Grove", "eli rainsberry", "Hana Lee", "Cel Davison", "Adrienne Lombardo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Fellow Traveller"], "esrb_rating": null}
