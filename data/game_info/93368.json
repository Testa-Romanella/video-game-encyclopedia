{"id": 93368, "slug": "the-difference-between-us", "name": "The Difference Between Us", "name_original": "The Difference Between Us", "description": "<p>The Difference Between Us is a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fan game about Fluttershy on her first date with Pinkie Pie. Fluttershy never knew that Pinkie felt that way about her, and she struggles to figure out what she wants and how she feels about Pinkie as she finds her way through the date.</p><p>There are three main routes through the date, and each route has three endings, all with several different variations depending on your prior choices. There's a little drama along the way, but there are no bad endings, just different ways of exploring a new relationship and the new feelings that come with it. All of the mane six as well as the cutie mark crusaders make appearances to offer advice, hang out, or even put on a show. And all along the way, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie will tell stories, share secrets, heal old wounds, and, hopefully, grow a little closer.</p><p>The Difference Between Us was made in Ren'Py</p><p><strong>UPDATE 4/1</strong> - Fixed a bug that made the text beeps occasionally play even when text speed was set to infinite.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2d/e2dfb66d0679e838dde400e83db9f667.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Robin Daydream"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
