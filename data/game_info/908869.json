When using SteamVR or Oculus desktop, make sure that platform is set to the default OpenXR platform. It also plays fine when streamed to Oculus Quest and Quest 2 through Oculus Link.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\r\nControlActionTriggerPaint (Erase) / Activate ButtonSide GripDrag to flyThumbsticksWalk/Turn.

I started this game in the final 5 hours of the jam so I didn't finish it in time to submit it for the jam. The themes from the jam that I used for this game are: hide, reveal, and paint.</p>\n<p>There's no saving/loading of your creations yet, but if there is enough interest (i.e. donations)\u00a0I'll add it. In the meantime, take and share screenshots and videos of your wonderful creations.\u00a0</p><p>For those of you asking about an Oculus Quest native build,\u00a0I couldn't quite get the performance up to par with an\u00a0Oculus Quest build. I might work on this more if there is enough <em>interest</em>. But you can stream it to your Quest via Oculus Link or Airlink.</p>\n<p><strong>Third Party Assets:</strong> Universal Sound FX library.
