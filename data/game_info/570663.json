{"id": 570663, "slug": "steel-gear", "name": "Steel Gear", "name_original": "Steel Gear", "description": "Steel Gear is a fan re-creation project. Re-imagined, and created in Unreal Engine 4. Designed from the ground up using\u00a0scratch made, and\u00a0professional grade assets\u00a0from the Epic Games marketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are \"Viper\". A special agent sent north of Galzburg South Africa, to rescue a captured comrade. While on your mission, you are tasked to destroy the ultimate weapon, \"The Steel Gear\"!\r\n\r\n\r\nBETA v1.9\u00a0\r\nPlease be aware this game is currently in Early Access Beta. You may experience glitches or bugs during your play through.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs/Issues\r\n<ul><li>Laser sight may lose function after equipping the cardboard box. (A death/respawn will fix the issue)(Recommend keeping it disabled if using the cardboard box regularly)</li><li>Music tracks may overlap. Usually temporary.\u00a0(Entering or exiting a building will usually correct this)</li><li>Once set off, pit traps do not reset</li><li>There are a few placeholder models still in game. Once new models are made they will be replaced. (Example: The Arnold Bosses are currently fat zombies)</li><li>There is no player save functionality currently implemented, but it should only take 1.5-2 hours to complete the game anyway.(Video/graphics options do save)</li><li>After a respawn the player currently drops all firearms, and you have to pick them back up.(I have it coded this way to avoid a certain CTD I was getting during a respawn. Hopefully fixable in a future version)</li><li>Performance. Framerates may vary depending on your rig. Settings in Video/Graphics options may help get more frames. (Set View Distance to Low, reduce shadow or texture quality.)</li><li>Currently the game is a little bloated with some unused assets that need cleaned out. Future releases should be smaller in GB size as I get it cleaned up.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible with Windows 64-bit PC rigs<br/></p>\n<p>Medium to High spec PC rigs are recommended.</p>\n<p>Game developed and tested on</p>\n<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K</li><li>32GB RAM</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti</li></ul>\n\n<p>Yes we all like to cheat sometimes:) So I have included a menu that allows you to do just that. Need ammo? No problem. Need rations? I got you covered. A\u00a0 cheat sheet has been included in the download. This was actually a personal addition I added to Steel Gear to help me with the development process. Have fun with it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Playing the game will be very similar to the original, but not exact. Some weapons and equipment have been changed completely. Also, new explorable areas have been added. It will be a whole new gaming experience, with a heavy taste of nostalgia.</p>\n<p><em><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>THIS GAME DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND!</strong>\u00a0Following a walkthrough for the NES version will get you through it, if you are having problems. Veteran players of the original will have no issues on where to go.(You've done this before!)</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>clintmich</p>\n\n<p>\u00a08-bit music tracks\u00a0are owned by Konami.
