The problem is, your store room of ingredients has come to life! In this Roguelike dungeon crawler/Cooking Simulator you must traverse a <strong>procedurally generated dungeon</strong> full of various food enemies. <strong><em>Reuse</em></strong> their bodies for food resources to bring back to the tavern where you prepare the ordered meals. Hurry through the dungeon and don't get lost or your guests will lose interest and leave! Make enough money to pay off your debt from buying the tavern and you win the game! <em><strong>Beware</strong></em> brave chef! If you take too much damage you\u2019ll die and lose the game, but you can always start over with a new dungeon!</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: Movement</p>\n<p>Left Click: Attack</p>\n<p>Space: Dash</p>\n<p>E: Inventory</p>\n<p>F: Interact</p>\n<p>For the theme we <strong><em>REUSE</em></strong> enemies corpses to make delectable dishes!</p>\n<p>The\u00a0Genre's we combined were a <strong>Dungeon Crawler</strong> and a\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Cooking Simulator</strong></p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Known bugs and fixes:</p><p>-<em>Getting stuck in inventory after hitting 'escape'</em> <strong><em>FIX: hit 'e' again, it will bring your cursor back and you can hit back to game</em></strong></p><p>-Issues with hitting escape during minigames sometimes causes issues</p><p>-Players can hit through walls and so can enemies</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T08:13:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/718/71898ff6f0549c607edbd6976117136f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["CloakandKill", "Splonah", "OrenRazin", "ChrisTheDonut"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
