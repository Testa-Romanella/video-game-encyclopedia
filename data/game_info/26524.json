{"id": 26524, "slug": "thruspace", "name": "ThruSpace", "name_original": "ThruSpace", "description": "<p>\n      ThruSpace is an exciting puzzle game in which you\u2019ll move and rotate an \n      object called a keydron through gaps in walls. Putting your keydron \n      through a gap gets you points, but mastering this ability allows you to \n      perform combos (picking up pairs of crystals simultaneously) and tricks \n      (rotating the keydron so that its shadow covers all of the gap before \n      passing through it), which are the keys to achieving high scores.\n    </p><p>\n      Refine your skills in multiple game modes (Normal, Endless, Trick \n      Challenge), brush up on the rules in Keydron Tutorial, or watch replay \n      data in Keydron Memories. As the game progresses, the number of \n      keydrons, backgrounds, stages, and levels you can choose will increase. \n      You can even connect to the Internet (broadband access required) and \n      register your high scores in the World Leaderboard to compare your \n      scores with other ThruSpace players.\n    </p><p>\n      Easy to play, but difficult to master, do you have the skills and \n      reflexes to overcome the increasingly complex challenges of ThruSpace?\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
