You can start playing the Story Mode at 5pm (solo or with a friend) with some pizza and finish it around 3am, the perfect game night! And then there's another 10 hours of gameplay time with the Challenge Mode!<br/><br/>Created by the co-designer of Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves, <strong>TimeMelters</strong> brings you to a mythical land of dreams and nightmares, where witch trials seem the only answer to the preternatural forces threatening the land.<br/><br/><strong>TimeMelters</strong> is a strategy-adventure game that features a unique game mechanic: Time Travel, which allows the players to go back in time and fight alongside themselves. You play as Teagan, a witch whose powers were just recently unleashed by an unwelcome guest. Now, you must venture forth in a desperate effort to cleanse the countryside from the seeping evil that is corrupting it. <br/><br/>It's not an RPG (although it has some features we normally see in RPGs, such as a skill tree, a great storyline and an eerie soundtrack), it's not an open world either (although we have a campaign with 20 huge, unique maps to defend), it's really a game that mixes strategy and action with all kind of other game mechanics (tower defense, puzzles, boss fights, survival missions, escort missions, etc.). <br/><br/><h3>Features:</h3><br/>Unique Time Shift game mechanic!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hybrid Action-Strategy gameplay: Plan a strategy and execute it all in real time! Puzzle maps, boss fights, escort missions, survival, etc. -- each mission has distinct objectives and brings unique twists on the time travel mechanic!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Co-op mode: Play the full campaign and the Speedrun Mode with a friend who owns the game (2 players)!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Startling storyline: Engaging campaign with all the twists, turns, nooks, crannies and what-the-bleep-just-happened moments you would -- and should -- expect from a story based on Time Travel!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T04:47:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/979b295faa7cdee0f5536b8e3dc8e9d6.jpg", "website": "http://www.timemelters.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 442, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Autoexec Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Autoexec Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
