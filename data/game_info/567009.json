Welcome!</strong><br/><br/>I started developing my first game\u00a0<strong><em>\"</em></strong><strong><em>Pervert's Paradise\"</em></strong>\u00a0as a hobby in February 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n\"Please remember that English is not my native language and I do not master it perfectly, my game at first will not be complicated, as I do not have enough programming skills and my computer is not so good, but with time and maybe future releases I will learn it better and hopefully be able to keep improving and try to adding new features.\"\r\n<br/>Pervert's Paradise Synopsis\r\n<p>Alan is a single guy\u00a0who recently turned 25 and decided to leave the small town where he lived to try life in the big city. With little money and without having attended colleges, he simply took the few savings he had and went to try life in the great metropolis of Esidarap (fictitious name). Even with little money he was greedy and rented a room in a mansion, super perverted, fan of exhibitionism and a charismatic manipulator, Alan will try to transform his life.</p>\r\nWhat's this game about?\r\n<p>This game focuses on exhibitionism. Alan is a guy who will try to put every woman he knows in his harem and turn them all into total exhibitionists, some easier, others more difficult, Alan's challenge will be to achieve this feat in all the women he meets, with a pinch of comedy in a totally fictitious world.</p>\n<p>At first I will not try to put too many options to choose from due to my minimal programming experience, but with experience and time I intend to increase the player's range of choice more and more! And so be capable of creating innumerable variables of choices.</p>\n<p>Will you help Alan become the Exhibitionist Harem King?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T07:47:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/824a13c92b36fb8bde717835e8c3b4a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["caxrGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
