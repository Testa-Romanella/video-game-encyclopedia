But when she arrived at work today, all the robots were all messed up and violent. She must use her trusty DroneBot to fire friendship at them and fix them all up.</p>\n<p>With every robot you fix, they'll join your team to help you fix the others. Some more effectively than others. You'll have to collaborate with these AI's to fix all the robots.<br/></p>\n\n<p>RandoBot was made to generate random numbers, but instead he's generating random attacks, movement, and music! Those aren't numbers!</p>\n<p>HitYouWithAWrenchBot was kind of always evil to be honest. His whole thing is hitting people with wrenches.\u00a0Maybe you can get him to hit bad guys with wrenches instead?<br/></p>\n<p>BoomBot used to be a standard quality control unit, then he found a box of dynamite and started blowing up the rejects. He started seeing everything as imperfect and acted accordingly.<br/></p>\n<p>MirrorBot was made so the CEO could see all of his money at once, because he just has that much. Don't get any ideas about unionizing though! Also he reflects attacks or something. I don't know.</p>\n<p>Also there's some fifth one but I can't reach it because the game is too hard for me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T06:51:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1e/c1e9bac0231cfb1c8a38cacccff4fcb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kitty_McTophat", "Procymbopteryx"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
