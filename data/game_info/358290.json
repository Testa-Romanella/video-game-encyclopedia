F = 4 points)<br/>- Customize the word length bonus (ie. A 6 letter word gives a 4x bonus)<br/>- Use Qu for Q when typed<br/>- Choose dictionary (ENABLE, SOWPODS,TWL, MOBY)<br/><br/>- Choose what color you want the word to highlight as ( Blue, Green, Light Gray, Magenta, Red, Yellow)<br/>- Show letter trails for the word found (ie.
