{"id": 961162, "slug": "axecutioners", "name": "Axecutioners", "name_original": "Axecutioners", "description": "Axecutioners is a 2D fighting game in which players must determine which axecutioner reigns supreme! In a kingdom dying of boredom, the ruling king took it upon himself to find his subjects (and himself) a new source of entertainment. Enter the colosseum, with its new (totally willing) participants, all of the prisoners in the land! However, as the kingdom runs out of prisoners to pit against one another, the duty of entertaining the masses has fallen to the king's loyal executioners. Now at the mercy of a local necromancer (to ensure the fights never end), the executioners, armed with their larger-than-life axes, are now tasked with slaying each other in an endless cycle to see who can be spared being brought back from death once again!<br/><br/>In Axecutioners you play as an axecutioner fighting for their life for the entertainment of the king, the kingdom, and the necromancer! Utilize your low, mid, and high attacks in rock-paper-scissors style combat. However, be careful; even though you are an absolutely yoked fighter, your axe is quite large and unwieldy, meaning your attacks are powerful but slow! This means you need to be very intentional with each attack, or else your opponent will win the favor of your audience!<br/><br/>Additionally, pick up the crown each round to empower your attacks! While it won't make you hit any harder (it is just a crown after all), it will give you the extra ability to cleave your opponents in half if you land the killing blow! Impress the audience (and your friends) by showing the other axecutioner who's boss!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-22T03:55:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d9/1d95ee45609ea38c56c5734e1026042d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Asset Cannon Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Asset Cannon Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
