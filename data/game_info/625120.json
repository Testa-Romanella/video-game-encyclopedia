The work of introspection on what I wanted to do in my life as well as the lack of its meaning struck me. I opened a video game engine for the first time two months ago and I have not stopped working on this personal project in order to be able to transcribe my thoughts.</p>\n<p>I don't know if the game will appeal to everyone, but I'd be happy if I hit at least one unknown person.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to try my game, it is very valuable to me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T05:45:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b43/b43e170c3a3eac22eadcaaa20238820e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Azzury55"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
