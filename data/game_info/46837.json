Grant, replacing Halleck, took the risky gamble of attacking the Confederates on three different fronts. While Grant failed to gain any significant tactical advantage in any battle against Robert E. Lee, he succeeded at depleting Lee\u2019s forces. On the Western front, Sherman was able to capture Atlanta and seize Savannah. The Union\u2019s control of the railways and waterways gave them an immense logistical advantage, which would become vital to the North\u2019s eventual success. The Confederacy was ultimately fighting and losing a defensive war.<br/><br/>Key Features:<br/><br/><ul><li>New map zoom feature.<br/></li><li>High Definition Civil War Graphics.<br/></li><li>7 Mission \u2018Tutorial\u2019 campaign.<br/></li><li>4 Mission abstract \u2018Division\u2019 campaign.<br/></li><li>7 Mission \u2018Cold Steel\u2019 campaign.<br/></li><li>7 Mission \u2018Duty and Pride\u2019 campaign.<br/></li><li>7 Mission Blockade campaign.<br/></li><li>7 Mission \u2018Freedom Calls\u2019 campaign.<br/></li><li>All missions can be played as both sides\u2028 (except the tutorial).<br/></li><li>8 Unique Civil War Units:<br/><ul><li>Infantry with Muskets.<br/></li><li>Infantry with Rifled Muskets.<br/></li><li>Artillery.<br/></li><li>Generals.<br/></li><li>Wagons.<br/></li><li>Naval Gunboats.<br/></li><li>Dismounted and Mounted Cavalry.</li></ul></li><li>Four classes of infantry \u2013 Raw, Average, Veteran and Elite.<br/></li><li>Different infantry formations: unformed, line for shooting and column for charging!<br/></li><li>Detailed Combat Analysis.<br/></li><li>Flank Attacks\u2028.<br/></li><li>Strategic Movement.<br/></li><li>Hours of Gameplay.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f3/7f3d7149ac8d84f51d9d13ca20cd4816.jpg", "website": "https://www.hexwar.com/downloads/civil-war-1864/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 63}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["HexWar Games", "Hunted Cow Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["HexWar Games", "Hunted Cow Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
