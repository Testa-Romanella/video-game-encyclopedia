Please be advised that this is NOT a demo. The game isn't anywhere close to finished. This is a WIP beta of content that has been created so far. It has 4 story chapters and a couple of optional chapters. This beta starts from chapter 1, skipping the prologue and introduction of initial characters due to the prologue not yet being complete.</p>\n<p>This is essentially an FE fangame, so don't expect anything too original here. It's intentionally borrowing heavily from FE, especially in this early portion of the game where not much of the unique stuff is available yet.<br/></p>\n<p>Many assets are currently placeholder as I didn't have time to complete them before the jam submission period. Don't expect all graphics to look correct, but hopefully, there are none missing (please report if there are).</p>\n<p>I would appreciate it if anyone who plays fills out this feedback survey so I know how well I achieved the goals I've set out to so far: https://forms.gle/9SuLWyNPtb1C9YZUA<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T10:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1c/e1c7e6508724c1915189175a804105a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crazyli825"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
