{"id": 879464, "slug": "space-trucker-demo", "name": "Space Trucker (Demo)", "name_original": "Space Trucker (Demo)", "description": "<p>Play as a space trucker taking on missions gather a variety of different cargo across the galaxy while avoiding the perilous junk floating throughout space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main gameplay will consist of driving your truck around an open environment in searching of the cargo that has been floating about in space. Alongside the cargo will be junk that you can also collect but doing so will decrease the amount of money gained for the mission. You collect items by getting close enough where they get caught in your gravity field (similar to the tractor beam from Star Wars).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I contributed to this project by implementing the gravity field to catch cargo and potentially junk as well as the end screen background manager and effects (spawning objects/creating particle systems).</p>\n<p>This game was created in a group\u00a0including Gwen, Andy, and me.</p>\n\r\n\r\nReflection:<p>The Space Trucker demo is representative of the core loop we wanted (Drive Around -&gt; Collect Cargo -&gt; Earn Money). At its current state I wouldn't say the game is too fun because there are a lot of issues in the game like the gravity field collecting items too fast, the tile map moving, the asteroids getting clumped up after only playing for one minute. If I could change it I would zoom out the camera more so the player has a better sense of the environment they are exploring, I would make it so junk/astroids de-spawn 5 seconds after hitting a boundary then respawn, fix the gravity field so it doesn't pick up the items quickly and add some visual effect to represent the bounds of the field. I would take the idea next by adding a shop where you can buy a laser, for example, to destroy the junk near you so you are not always resorted to driving away, adding more relations between the junk you collect and the speech bubbles to amplify the humor, and create more random junk sprites that would be floating around.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T15:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/221e5a37aa659f29d0620e4e438da8f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cooper Rapp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
