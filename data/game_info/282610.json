You decide.", "description": "<p>A fun experience to muck around with. <strong>Herd pet ants around</strong> your screen or just watch them in this <strong>relaxing ant sim</strong>. Computer and Mobile friendly. Controls are included for both.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>VIRTUAL ANTS</strong> \u00a0is an updated version of REAL ANT with a better name ;) Ants are now faster and their speed scales with their size. Bigger ants move faster than their smaller counterparts. Their AI has been tweaked slightly to increase their realism even further. You can fool the non tech savvy and younger kids, into thinking you have an ant stuck behind your screen.<br/></p>\n<p>The single ant is fun to watch and play with. It will turn towards mouse clicks, or finger taps. It's like having <strong>your own pet ant.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Tapping or clicking exactly\u00a0on the first ant, will <strong>spawn another ant</strong>. On keyboards you can also press A for another Ant. Ants Spawn from the home icon... well they have to live somewhere ;) If you lose track of your first ant, don't worry. You can just click or tap repeatedly at \u00a0fast rate,  until all the ants are gathering under your pointer or finger and you will be able to spawn more ants.<br/></p>\n<p>You can <strong>spawn hundreds of ants</strong> as long as your device is powerful enough. You can herd vast amounts of ants as they all turn towards your mouse clicks or taps.<br/></p>\n<p>On Keyboards, press the up and down cursor keys to <strong>Resize your ants</strong>. Choose a size that looks realistic for your screen. The ants that reach the edge and corners  of the screen appear to try to get out before giving up and heading elsewhere.<br/></p>\n<p>On tablets and phones, each press and hold on the screen will increase the size of you ants one size, until they get too big and wrap around to smaller sizes again.</p><p>This was just a simple exercise to help me learn better AI for my main project Droid Arena but these little guys grew on me and \u00a0I just had to make a game? maybe experience is a better word, for them to star in. Enjoy!</p><p>One thing to add. \u00a0VIRTUAL ANTS has  <strong>very low system requirements</strong>. I've had well over 50 ants running around on an old Samsung Galaxy S2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d7/3d72130b942f2a2c27c5fea90ce50770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clockwork Hippo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
