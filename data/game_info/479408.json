Using the new Trijam branding art by AXLplosion, I created such a GIF using GameMaker Studio 2, tweening, and a little bit of Smear FX and Juice FX.</p>\n\n<p>This was the original artwork I sourced the components from:</p>\n\n<p>I later retooled the GIF, removing the \"Triple\" and repositioning the objects as needed to make a generic Trijam animated GIF that's now used for all the standard weekly Trijams.</p>\n\n<p>You download the GMS2 source code below for your own interest.</p>\n<p>It was mainly achieved with hand-designed tweens, rotating and growing the elements on separate timers. I used a bit of randomness for the bulk of the small elements, making that a bit easier for me while giving a nice effect.</p><p>You can see the development of subsequent test GIFs on the right-side.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:38:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b0/0b0a86e0e0771b578365036b71229fa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
