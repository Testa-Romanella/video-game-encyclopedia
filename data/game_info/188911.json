Rotate them with the left and right arrow keys while dragging them (or hold them over the turntable at the top left corner)! Or pull other items off of the grid to make more room! Items you drop, or allow to scroll off the screen, will reappear again later.</p>\n<p>The first number in a level's name rates how many items you'll see - a higher rating means more items! The second number is how fast the level is - a higher rating means items scroll by faster, and you get less time!</p>\n<p>Every level can be solved perfectly... but can you figure out how to do it quickly enough? Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7c795b5f15d68eec5eb0fa61354ce1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["talrnu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
