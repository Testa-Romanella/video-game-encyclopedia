It falls under multiple genres, such as: Psychological Horror, Drama and Mystery.\u00a0\r\nWeren't you at times curious about those creepy tales our grannies used to know...about heart devouring monsters, three headed dragons and earthly beauties being cemented alive into walls?... No?\u00a0\r\nWhat about stories of people talking to animals or the dead coming back to life? You might've heard of those, for sure.\r\nBlessings, curses, good and evil. We see it everywhere. But it's always the way how the events unfold that leaves people thinking in the end.\u00a0\r\nThe idea for Konstandin came as a result of our desire to show the world something inspired from our rich Albanian folklore, combined with a modern setting.</p>\n<p>And for us there is no better way, than turning our story into an engaging role playing game!</p>\n<p>A year has passed since the 26 year old Rinor Avdiu married his university crush Aulona. Due to her circumstances, the couple had to move to the only place that could improve Aulona's condition, a village named Buroja. It's a pretty desolate place, but as long as the two of them are together, all is well.</p>\n<p>Lulled into a sense of peace through their daily routine, the couple enjoys a relatively normal marital life. At times Rinor forgets to wash the dishes or buys the wrong groceries, but all is well.</p>\n<p>A nice day, a normal day, everyday...<br/>That is until two girls are reported missing and the couple slowly realizes that Buroja holds an old eerie legend in which they're partaking.\u00a0The legend of a cursed knight, called Konstandin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The story revolves around Rinor who tries to find the meaning behind it, while he faces horrific mental and physical challenges.</p>\n\n\n<ul><li>A story worth unraveling \u00a0</li><li>Full voice acting\u00a0</li><li>Original soundtracks and songs\u00a0</li><li>Various puzzles, riddles and fancy poems\u00a0</li><li>Beautiful character art\u00a0</li><li>Animated cutscenes</li><li>Custom made sprites and pixel animations\u00a0</li><li>Plenty of CG\u2019s</li><li>Unique blessing system\u00a0</li><li>6+ hours of gameplay\u00a0</li><li>4 playable characters\u00a0</li><li>100+ Parallax maps\u00a0</li><li>Choices you\u2019ll most likely regret making\u00a0</li><li>Numerous different ways to die\u00a0</li><li>Multiple endings\u00a0</li><li>Gross, detailed descriptions\u00a0</li><li>Awkward first meetings\u00a0</li><li>Lame jokes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d80/d80ade701030c83a4435608f59180ee8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Galanx"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
