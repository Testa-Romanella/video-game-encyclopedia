And that's where<strong> WIPE</strong> came out. Humorous, funny, multiplayer shooter about <strong>coronavirus</strong>, <strong>quarantine</strong> and <strong>urge to grab as much toilet paper</strong> as possible.<br/>It was a fun journey, allowing us to gather inspiration by doing something entirely different. These two-weeks internal Game\u00a0Jam renewed and motivated us to get back to our <strong>main</strong> 5 year project - <strong>Alan Sharp</strong>. <br/>Wipe: Toilet Plague is a free, fun project and any donation will be of great help to us in working on our projects.<br/><br/><strong>Wipe: Toilet Plague is playable via Steam Account. You need to have steam open in order to connect with your friends.</strong><br/><br/> #StaySafe #Havefun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T05:41:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63c9a2784ac26b549e19e6103d27f823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mystive Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
