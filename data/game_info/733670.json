I do this on purpose, because it is the most accessible UI on the planet.</p><p>You can find the source code at\u00a0https://github.com/playdeezgames/TGGD_sdldiscordjam1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/463/46345bf998f98631ba9dde840665496d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Grumpy GameDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
