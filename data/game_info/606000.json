Yes it is a platformer, at least for one player. In this game two players play against each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One is Persephone the cat, that tries to escape Hades, the underworld. Meanwhile, the other player is Hades themselves and tries to kill Persephone, so that she cannot escape them (We know the story\u00a0sounds quite similar to \"Hades\" the rouge-like but we had this idea before knowing about that game).</p>\n<p>Hades controls parts of the Underworld in form of blocks, with whom they try to crush Persephone:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>NUMPAD 4 and 6 / Left and Right</li><li>NUMPAD 8 / Rotate</li></ul>\n<p>She instead has only her cat body and tries to dodge those deadly blocks while also using them as platforms to get to the surface. She can double jump and use her claws to stick to the blocks. With her godly powers she can also use a super burst, which thrusts her upwards and also destroys blocks in her path. The treasures of the Underworld help her to regain that power:</p>\n<ul><li>A and D or Left arrow and Right arrow / Left and Right</li><li>W or Up arrow / Jump</li><li>E / Super Burst</li></ul>\n\n<p>This Game is made by</p>\n<p><strong>Cedric Nering</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kristin W\u00fcnderlich\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Saleem Ahmad</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Syawish A Rehman</strong></p><p>Also Credits to:</p><p>Models:\u00a0Column Model by https://bit.ly/2An9amn Kabourek Roman, sketchfab.com\u00a0</p><p>Images: Tile texture by https://bit.ly/2C2MOXH valadzionak-volha, freepik.com Background by https://bit.ly/31JK2BP UPKLYAK, freepik.com Sound Effects and\u00a0</p><p>Music: Coin sound: https://bit.ly/3eVkmpx by harrietniamh Background sound by https://bit.ly/2VIOeOm Jerry Lacey, Epidemic Sound Rotation sound, explosion sound, walking sound, squish death sound, jump sound by epidemicsound.com (subscription)\u00a0</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T05:50:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b1/6b127b352a63efa7cb5992acbdc40f67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IDHadow", "Arcaelia"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
