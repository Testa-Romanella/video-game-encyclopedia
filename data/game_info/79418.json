In Super Phantom Cat, players take on the role of Chemist White and embark on an action-packed journey through the Phantom World.<br/><br/>When Chemist White was a small child, he was saved by Super Phantom Cat -- who then became his personal hero. Years later, Flash Cat takes Chemist White on a journey to the Phantom World; there, Chemist White discovers he can collect data shards and change into a number of characters -- including the all-powerful Super Phantom Cat :)  <br/><br/>The world of Super Phantom Cat is filled with challenges that will make any platforming fan jump for joy. You\u2019ll need quick reflexes as you pull off incredible feats such as bouncing on a monster\u2019s head to land on a difficult-to-reach platform or rapidly jumping between small platforms to get across a massive chasm. You\u2019ll need to be inch-perfect if you want to make it to the end.<br/><br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/><br/>*   A modern twist on retro platformers with a quirky plot<br/>*   Clean, colorful art and whimsical character design<br/>*   Awesome chiptune soundtrack<br/>*   Hardcore platforming gameplay that\u2019s perfectly tuned for touchscreens<br/>*   Fully customizable controls<br/>*   Bonus levels for even more challenge and depth <br/>*   Endearing unlockable characters ranging from a cute chicken to a menacing vampire (and everything in between)<br/>*   Only two IAPs, which are used to get energy drinks and unlock special characters<br/><br/>******************************************************************************************<br/>If you have any idea to make this game better, please let us know :)<br/>Mail to hi@veewo.com<br/>Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/veewosupercat/<br/>Follow us on Twitter to get latest update: @VeewoGames and @SuperPhantomCat<br/>Join our topic thread at TouchArcade: http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=280459&amp;highlight=super+phantom", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bdc8dd7aed8c2e5c3cd888c2e4ebb92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Veewo Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Beijing Veewo Game Co"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
