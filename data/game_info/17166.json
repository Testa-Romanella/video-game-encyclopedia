Try to shoot anyone in your line of fire, and stay out of other player's lines for as long as you can. Be the fastest shooter or use slow bullets to control the play area, but be careful not to fire too haphazardly - needing to reload could be the end for you!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features many options and settings to customise gameplay, as well as AI players for a challenge when you're short on friends.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBANG BANG BANG! works well at events and game nights, and is well suited for parties or just playing with friends on a couch.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:06:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21d/21dec818013ed48c956d3ed93e613747.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 48}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sophie Houlden"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sophie Houlden"], "esrb_rating": null}
