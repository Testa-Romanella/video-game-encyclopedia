It is my entry to the 2022 edition of the BASIC 10 Liner Contest, PUR-80 (max 80 characters per logical line, abbreviations allowed) category.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Bastilude is inspired by the Joust arcade game, developed by Williams and first released in 1982. The player controls (with a lot of imagination) a knight riding a green dragon. The objective is to unseat the opponent knights, riding magenta dragons, in a joust, or hastilude. The winner of a joust is the rider whose mount is highest at the moment of contact. A collision of equal height repels the characters apart. The difficulty level progressively increases as the opponents are defeated and they become faster.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The o and p keys control the dragon\u2019s horizontal direction and velocity, while the z key makes the dragon fly. Only a single command is accepted at a time, so you can either control the horizontal speed and direction or flap the dragon's wings.</p>\n<p>Emulation powered by JSSpeccy.<br/>Sinclair and ZX Spectrum are \u00a9 Amstrad / Sky In-Home Service Ltd. <br/></p>\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
