I am a 14-year-old developer from the UK and I have made this game in just 2 weeks to try to raise funds for the trip of a lifetime to Tanzania. Of course, the game is free, and do not feel as though you have to donate, but all of the proceeds will go towards this trip where I will be trekking with the Maasai tribe, helping towards community initiative projects such as building for the locals and planting trees at the bottom of Mt. Kilimajaro.</p>\n<p>Immerse yourself in this <strong>stylized</strong>,<strong> first-person zombie</strong><strong>\u00a0wave shooter</strong> which has been inspired by Call of Duty Zombies. Set in a forest, fight your way through each wave and earn points to spend in the shop. Here you can purchase more guns or upgrade them as you wish. Pick up the ammo dropped by the zombies, or purchase it in the shop to ensure you are always in stock. If you get low on health, you can always purchase a health remedy to keep you in the fight. And remember:\u00a0look behind you!</p>\n<p><strong>Some of the features include:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A unique stylized forest setting</li><li>Waves like CoD Zombies</li><li>Intelligent zombie AI</li><li>Challenging gameplay</li><li>Intricate systems</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T13:31:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/100/100d2b5e9194e4c596e039712f5d3463.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarleyTho"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
