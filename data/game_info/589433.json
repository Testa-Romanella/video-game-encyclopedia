{"id": 589433, "slug": "danmaken", "name": "Danmaken", "name_original": "Danmaken", "description": "<p>With this game we\u00a0wanted to explore the melee danmaku concept.\u00a0The idea is to have an incentive to move around and proactively take risks by forcing the need to get close to the enemies. We integrated the \"10 seconds\" JAM theme right into this very idea:\u00a0if you stay still in a safe spot for too long and don't actively try to chase the enemies, you get punished. You have to take risks!</p>\r\nA bit of lore\r\n<p>The name \"Danmaken\" is referring to the sword. It's a cursed sword that has a will of its own, and will form a demonic contract with anyone who dares wiled it. In the game, the main character is but one of the many wielders it has had, and they're trying to use\u00a0the sword's power to defeat the Overlord of the Dankai:\u00a0the Amalgademon.</p>\n<p>\"Danmaken\"\u00a0is a word play on the japanese word\u00a0\"danmaku\" (\u5f3e\u5e55), which translates to \u201cbullet curtain\u201d. The \u5f3e \u201cdan\u201d part is the same, but the \u5e55 \u201cmaku\u201d part has been replaced by \u9b54\u5263 \u201cmaken\u201d, which sounds similar but means \u201ccursed sword\u201d.</p>\r\nFuture of the game\r\n<p>We didn't have nearly enough time to expand on the idea or fine-tune any of the different aspects. We plan on continuing with this project and eventually release a more polished beta with a full stage, more\u00a0enemy variety, better designed bullet patterns, and more interesting implementations of the melee mechanic. Stay tuned!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce2/ce2395b4ef69568cb11d5ae983d1c5d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["takokiko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
