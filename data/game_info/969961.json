The action takes place in an original fantasy universe in which you have to take control of the fate of an entire continent. During the story campaign, you will take one castle after another by storm, step by step freeing your patrimony from the power of the vile but powerful empire of Denatar. Para Bellum is an unusual RTS that uses original mechanics for the genre.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You are the first ruler to unite the scattered kingdoms of western Kiltmer under your rule in order to effectively counter the threat of the elven empire of Denatar. However, the Emperor of the Elves and the most vile of his vassals managed to outwit you: your army was weakened, your brother was killed, and you managed to escape only by a miracle, after a fierce battle for the capital. Many years have passed, and finally you have the opportunity to return what is yours by right, recapture every fortress of western Kiltmer and end the rule of the cunning elves!<br/><br/>Having examined the sketch of the fortress walls from your scouts, having analyzed the enemy's defenses, you lined up your army in the correct formation, putting each troop in its place. All troops have special abilities and their own specialization. It is necessary to correctly combine units with their abilities to overcome the enemy's defense.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, it doesn't end there! You have to personally lead the assault, opening up the potential of each troop on each of the five attacking lines simultaneously. Cover defenseless soldiers with shields, dodge the devastating shots of enemy ballistae, counteract the attacks of the besieged, light torches in the darkness and In the end, break through the gates of the coveted castle with successive blows of your rams!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game sets certain conditions at the stage of army formation. You are free to choose the troops and their formation by yourself. To line up a turtle bristling with shields so that no enemy arrow reaches the target, or opposite, to shower the defenders with heavy fire of their own arrows, so that they are afraid to even look towards your impending army - the choice is yours!
