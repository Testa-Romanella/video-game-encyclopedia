You start out at Level 1 with 1 row of bricks. You unlock the next level by hitting the ceiling, thereby unlocking the next row of bricks as well.</p>\n<p>You complete the game by hitting the ceiling in Level 8.</p>\n<p>When you shoot a ball, it is \"activated\". Only activated balls can break bricks or unlock the next level when they hit the ceiling.</p>\n<p>When a ball hits a brick, the ceiling, or another ball, it is \"deactivated\" and cannot break anything else for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>When you complete each level, your current score will be saved for that level and added to an overall score.</p>\n<p>It is up to you to decide whether you want to aim for the high score in a particular level, or overall.</p>\n<p>At any time you can also press E to end the game on your own accord.</p>\n<p>That's all you need to know.
