You do this by picking up money from piles found at fixed locations in the bank, that generate and store\u00a0money over time.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Sounds easy right?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It would be, if the nasty police wouldn't constantly be on your heels. You will need to find a balance between picking up money piles and fighting off the police. This is where your partners, who distract the police, will become a vital part to your strategy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is the DEMO version of the game, and is still being developed. A\u00a0kickstarter will be launched soon</strong>.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of things planned for the game:</p>\n<ul><li>Weapons with attachments and skins customization.</li><li>A lot of different banks, each with their own difficulties and strategies.</li><li>A partner progression system.</li><li>Challenges that require you to do specific things.</li><li>Even deeper player customization.</li><li>A more complex enemy AI, and a lot more enemy types.</li><li>Hiring a 3D artist to make custom models.</li><li>Hiring a sound artist to make cool music and SFX.</li></ul>\n<p>But this all depends on how well the kickstarter does.</p>\n<p>If you enjoy the game. Stay up to date, and help support the kickstarter when it comes out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/8c4tXAa</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/GhysStudios</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:30:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e99/e996826d6ef92940dbb058aac06e0e7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ghys Sudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
