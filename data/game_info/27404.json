I just read about this legendary Pyramid of Gold, and you&#39;re gonna help me go explore it. There&#39;s lots of treasure in there for the taking, and I want it all. I&#39;m sure there are gonna be all kinds of weird enemies and big, bad bosses in there, so if you don&#39;t think you can hack it, put the game down now. I don&#39;t want any losers making me jump into bottomless pits, you hear me?</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2001-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-04T12:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/64f/64f2745f1f49b106a523ce3defdbfc03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.24, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 31, "beaten": 57, "toplay": 23, "dropped": 18, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 57, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 59, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
