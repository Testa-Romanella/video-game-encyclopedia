We are trying to fix them. Huge thanks to all who checked this game! XD</p>\n<p>This is a small game created for a player experience school project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Part from our research report:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"In this project, we want to design a game without any jumpscare to test whether we can trigger the player's fear using only the environment and sound effects. Our game aims to create a horror puzzle game with no traditional horror elements that only create an immediate shock to the players and do not last long. We are using puzzles to entice players to explore the space and let players stay in the game. During the time they are in the spaces, the environment will gradually change from a normal kindergarten to a crashed horror space. We want to use a mild pace but let the players get goosebumps when they immerse in our game. We do not want to scare the players, and our goal is to let the players shiver.\"\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T09:29:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a120cc0501c799410cd821ea1246730.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Halfmooner", "monachen", "KuroTori_OD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
