Being irresponsible here is rewarded, as the entire level turns into absolute chaos thanks to our state of the art physics. In the end, only the most wasteful player gets to take home the victory! Make sure to pass by the clothing booth to customise\u00a0 your character!</p>\n<p>This is a student project Created by:\u00a0Alluyn A\u00e4ron, Cotman Sam, De voecht Jana, Geens Andries, Verstraete Simon.\u00a0The game features local multiplayer up to 4 players, full player customisation, an intractable menu that acts as a training ground and currently features one level. The goal of our team was to create a co-op party game that was accessible and easy to play by anyone of any age, we accomplished this by focusing on a readable art style, understandable mechanics and intuitive controller keybindings.</p>\n<p>FOR MORE INFO VISIT OUR WEBSITE BY CLICKING HERE</p>\n<p>(NOTE: Due to the game only having local co-op at the time, it might be difficult to get everything set-up to play with 4 controllers on one computer.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8c/e8cd4476f6ff431631b35898479c032f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ActuallyAaron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
