Your company's latest software, Regenerate, is capable of restoring a computer's software in case of a virus.</p>\n<p>You find yourself in a meeting room one day with no particular memory of what the meeting was about, or how you even got there. Trying to shrug it off, you go home only to get into an accident. Rather than going to a hospital, you regain consciousness in the meeting room. This repeats itself three more times, and leads to even more tragedy with each iteration, with the death of those close to you, and winding up in a psychiatric hospital.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Description:</strong></p>\n<p>This game is an open-world RPG with unique and intense storytelling. The game is sub-divided into 2 Acts, each Act containing 6 Chapters (or Episodes).</p>\n<p>The world itself is divided into several islands, some of which are inaccessible until later in the game. The free-roaming elements include buying businesses (you're a billionaire, after all), and building relationships. There's over 50 collectibles that can be found. With the right blueprints, they can be combined, with over 5000 possible results.</p>\n<p>You may also pick up various personality traits in the game. Increasing certain traits will change the player's personality, and how others react. For example, ranks in the \"Aggression\" trait may cause you to engage in more fights.</p>\n<p><strong>Character Description:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>John Caleb<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\"The Billionaire software genius who developed a computer program which has capability to reverse the effects of a virus and restore OS back to its original state.
