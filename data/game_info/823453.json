In this VR experience, you can shoot a grappling hook that comes out of your hand to swing around New York City! To shoot the hook, press trigger, and to reel it in, hold grip. Be careful with the reeling though, it is very fast and you usually shouldn't use it to swing effectively. Have fun!</p>\n\n<p>You might be asking: why try this game instead of all the other VR rope-swinging games? Well, this one uses the actual physics of the game engine combined with true rope physics, meaning that when you are swinging on the hook, you are actually swinging how you would in real life!</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the game is only supported on PCVR because of performance issues on Oculus Quest.</p>\n\n<p>Any donations are appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T23:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a8e41800d2ff286002b016e7886313c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frizame"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
