She's studied and played on and off the ice for as long as she can remember. Her knowledge and toughness are top notch. While she's never been gifted in natural skill, she's one of the best when it comes to adapting to opponents and teammates. There's only one problem, her temper. Paige has racked up innumerous suspensions and even been kicked off teams for her legendary bouts of rage.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tHowever, she finally feels like she has her temper under wraps and she's ready to give her favorite sport another go. Her brother has agreed to bring her to practice with his dek hockey team to see if she's ready to handle competition once again. First step, making sure she can get along with her new teammates! \r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 Romantic Interests</li>\n<li>6 CGs</li>\n<li>3 Date Epilogues</li>\n<li>Approximately 35,000 words</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nHey everyone! I finally finished this game after 2 years. It's amazing what a trial this was considering it is only around 35,000 words. So sorry for all the delays, it's been a busy year for me. Along with the new art, I've added additional content including date epilogues for each of the guys that take place a few months into the relationship.\u00a0The game is free, so if you enjoy it, I hope you share it with your friends!\u00a0I'm glad to have the updated and final version for you all to play!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tumblr Post</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/493/493a5e21468c0967dd4fa3f53e3f7e3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Yoshibb"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
