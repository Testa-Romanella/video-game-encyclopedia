It's an NES inspired RPG in the style of old classics like FF1 and DQ1. The alpha here is just the first continent but it definitely gives people a chance to try the game at and get a feel for what it's like. The difficulty might be on the harder side but the game can be switched to easy from the menu which should make the game much more accessable. If you're brave enough to switch it to hard just know I've not tested a playthrough of that out yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soon I'll have a questionaire up asking about peoples thoughts and experiences on what is essentially a demo. My hope is to have the game complete...ish sometime in the next 3-5 months working on adding more content to the game from this point forward.
