It is a trip into your past, a chance to rediscover long forgotten treasures or let go of old memories weighing you down. Packing can be a bitter end or the beginning of an exciting new adventure.</p>\n<p>This experience was created as a part of the Meditation Game project and is playable on September 3rd.</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://meditations.games/\u00a0</p>\n<p>The inspiration was very much my lived experience at the time of making the experience. I was in the middle of packing our house to move and I\u00a0don't look forward to doing that again any time soon!\u00a0 For fun here is a link to a twitter thread where I\u00a0documented some of the other weird things I\u00a0found while cleaning out my house.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/CodeCrafty/status/1066170764267786240</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:33:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32bbfd897b3fe2550e72536528051624.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Allison Salmon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
