It will teach you how to draw little oak trees, which provide shade for clovers, which make flowers that bees like, which then pollinate your oak trees so you can start over and draw more oak trees. It's a calming experience, though I\u00a0never really found that \"thing\" that would make it pop. I think doodle games could be a fun little genre and I\u00a0hope to make more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:55:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dd/6dd2a60f7bcc45017a64ac87e1e212cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marek Kapolka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
