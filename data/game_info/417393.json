Blue platforms have gravity pulling towards them and red platforms have anti gravity which pushes the player character and some physics objects away from them. The game is played from a 3d third person perspective. The goal is to navigate to the exit teleporter by solving the puzzles involving changing the direction of gravity using switches and a gun which will reverse the direction of gravity when fired at the platform.<br/><br/><ul>[* Reverse gravity using your gravgun][* Solve the puzzles to find your way to the teleporter][*change the position of the platforms to effectively clear the levels]</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T02:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b2/9b21fe5968a437fbbff56b39b3e2f8c2.jpg", "website": "http://thevoicesgames.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 68, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["The Voices Games"], "genres": ["Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["The Voices Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
