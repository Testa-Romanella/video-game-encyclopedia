The player must read a script one word at a time and press the corresponding button to continue the speech. Be careful, as there incorrect words thrown in to throw you off (stalling words such as ahh and umm). Also be sure to move around a bit on the stage and maintain eye contact with the audience.</p><p>We recommend you take some time to get used to the controls backstage before beginning your speech.</p><p>There are a number of alternative endings. See if you can find them all.
