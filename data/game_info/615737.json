It's me here :))\u00a0This is the version 1.1\u00a0of the Minesweeper mod - Legosweeper! In the middle of this virus pandemic, I was bored with developing Covid-20 P2 so I updated this.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wait, hold up, what IS Legosweeper???</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Well, Legosweeper is\u00a0a modded version of Minesweeper, which you'll be placed in a Lego-nerd's room, and there are tons of Lego pieces everywhere UNDER the carpet!! \ud83d\ude31 You must carefully get out of there as soon as possible. If you step on a Lego, you will lose a life. In this version, you will have so much more than the Demo Version: money, shop, menu, pausing, time &amp; highscore and so much more!! What are you waiting for?? :P\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>So, do I need to pay anything and\u00a0how to play it then??</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>First, this game sucks (like really sucks) so ALWAYS 100% free (or until it becomes better). Second,...\u00a0just\u00a0google \"How to play Minesweeper\" man! :P\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>If this was version 1.1, then where are the 1.0 version and the demo??</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0- 1.0:\u00a0https://dqg.itch.io/legosweeper-full-v-1\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Demo:\u00a0<em>https://dqg.itch.io/legosweeper-demo-version-the-lego-builder</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>But, what is difference\u00a0between this and v1.0???</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>- I've updated it quite a lot: A new menu, better gameplay, less lag, and many annoying bugs fixed!! But let me know if there are still bugs\u00a0in the comments! :)\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Also, if you like coding and Lego, you may like my channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7WGw-2FL5agpPTCGePwIhQ</p>\n<p><strong>If you have any concerns about this project, post a comment below!
