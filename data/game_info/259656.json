I'm a complete newbie in Game Development but i always had an interested in games since i was a little kid. I made this simple game by following the \"Roll A Ball\" tutorial from Unity and adding my own touch to it so i decided to share it. Obviously there is a lot of features that could be added and improved but i decided to keep it small and simple for my first ever game so i can have a strong foundation :) it's not the greatest game ever but i like it and maybe you will too! <br/></p><p><strong>In this game you are a ball that has to collect pick ups and carefully avoiding the obstacles! If you reach the score then you progress to another level. It may sound easy but different picks up have different score points, and increase your speed so it's harder to move around!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Controlls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D to move\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button to click</p>\n<p>R to restart<br/></p>\n<p>i would like to give credits to:</p>\n<p>Main Menu music by JBA_Music: https://freesound.org/people/JBA_Music/sounds/257869/</p>\n<p>Menu Play/Quit confirmation sound inspectorj: https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/403007/</p>\n<p>Menu Help/Back confirmation sound by Theogobbo: https://freesound.org/people/Theogobbo/sounds/397472/</p>\n<p>First level music by yummie: https://freesound.org/people/yummie/sounds/410574/</p>\n<p>Second level\u00a0 music by mrthenonorha: https://freesound.org/people/Mrthenoronha/sounds/369920/</p>\n<p>Third level\u00a0 music by xsgianni: https://freesound.org/people/xsgianni/sounds/388079/</p>\n<p>Pick up sound by inspectorj (cut down): https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/412068/</p>\n<p>Fedora model by Utzon Jorn: https://archive3d.net/?a=download&amp;id=ad3b4de7</p>\n<p>Helmet model by Boo: https://archive3d.net/?a=download&amp;id=08089062</p>\n<p>Cap model by Schindler Michael: https://archive3d.net/?a=download&amp;id=2382b1eb</p>\n<p>And of course a huge thanks to Brackeys,\u00a0 blackthornProd,\u00a0 Game Dev underground and Matthew Palaje for all their tutorials, advice and tips! :)</p>\n<p>You can let me know what you think!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66d/66d74718527f4c53e39692977f8fdc01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Chr0n1cle"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
