Heal them to restore your population and train new clerics:</p>\n<p><strong>Templars: </strong>The bulk of your defenses, Templars are cheap to train and hold their ground. [<em>cost 3 population</em>]<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Zealots:</strong> Aggressive units. Expensive to train, but will wreak havoc on the enemy. Have a tendency to charge off the battlefield. [<em>cost 10 population</em>]<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Medics: </strong>Trained to keep your Templars and Zealots alive. Won't fight the horde directly. [<em>cost 5 population</em>]</p>\n\n<p>To train you units, select a unit type from the top, and click one of the dots on the field. This will begin construction of a new training tower, which, once completed, will release newly trained units.<br/></p>\n<p>Once every unit from a tower is defeated, the tower will collapse, allowing you to train new units.<br/><br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Brian Cummings:</strong> Character Designs &amp; Sprites</p>\n<p><strong>Jacquillin \"Jackie\" Ly:</strong> Enviroments &amp; Concept Art<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Michael A Chartuk:</strong> Audio &amp; Splash screen<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Galan Montgomery:</strong> Programming<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:20:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3f/f3f500ef1213b61a76405d6a0c94f66c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Galan Montgomery"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
