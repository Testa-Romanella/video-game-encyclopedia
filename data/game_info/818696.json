You navigate a knight trying to ascend a tower reaching far into the night sky.\u00a0</p><p>You have two dices that you throw in combat and when you explore. You can only choose one of the dice so choose wisely!</p><p>You trigger your skills by choosing the right dice colors until the \"bars\" is full, and then you can trigger that skill by choosing the right dice color.</p><p>The game is actually inspired by one of my older jam games, the tower knight where I did the art and music myself for Ludum dare. But this time I decided to try to make a game with existing 3D models and SFX/music.</p><p>Thank you for playing! Let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T12:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a8293c346390e7e23447c4d5ccf8ee33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Appox"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
