But touching the sides of the tunnel can be dangerous as well, so try to stay in the air and collect as many red items as possible to restore your color and crack your highscore!\r\n</p>\r\nTotally underrated features\r\nLocal highscore\r\n<p>The game saves your personal highscore!</p>\r\nInteractive menu\r\n<p>Adapt the game to your preferences by hitting the buttons in the menu! This toggles the different modules on or off making it easier or harder.
