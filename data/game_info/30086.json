From the darkest forests at the top of the world comes this legend of a lost child who knows no fear. It is the story of a broken sword in need of repair and of a boy&#39;s fight with Fafner, the guardian of a ring whose power he will wield. Discover the Golden Age of Siegfried, as he slays monsters, defies great powers and beguiles Brunehilde the Valkyrie in the Twilight of the Gods. This is a time of courage and betrayal, and of passion and revenge.
