NEVER EVER merge scenes in unity as we learnt the hard way, having to rebuild certain parts of the world\u00a0again. Now, we have developed a better management system to avoid scene clashes.</p>\n<p>The sheep are also unpredictable and float about everywhere which wasn't intended but some of the people who played found it funny they kept wandering about. I think of it like the characters in sims, where the designers deliberately made the sims act like children with no decision making skills (idiots). In this, your having fight with the inept sheep and their physics to get them into the pen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2aa/2aa291e63241aaeb7414ccc06726da95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stephen James Borland"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
