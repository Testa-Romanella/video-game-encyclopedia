What would a 2019 style game feel like\u00a0with the sort of concessions to adapt for the form factor. It's my first time working with screen effects to shift the color and pixel density, and also 2d animated sprites. I have so much to learn and improve on.</p>\n<p>This game was made with Unity 2018.3, SFXR, and Aseprite. There was so much I wanted to add (more complex brick building shapes, many more weapons, and enemy patterns). Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p><ul><li>If you let a knight slip into the fire their death wont count and the game will be softlocked.
