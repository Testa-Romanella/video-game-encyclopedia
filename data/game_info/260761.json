Every day in October I posted a picture or a video about the game on social networks.\u00a0</em></p><p><strong>Story\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It's a game about a ghost. It returnes home for only one night, at Samhuinn and you have to help it to find its love. I found my inspiration with Halloween, Samhuinn and Scotland. I like the idea deads could come back one night a year. It's a nice tradition.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy the game ! The gameplay is very simple. You can move with arrows and move the camera with the mouse.\u00a0</p><p>Warning</p><p>There is probably bugs and flying objects. I still learning game creation with\u00a0 Unity, so a lot of things could be better.\u00a0You can contact me about that, I will fix the problems later. I thank you =)</p><p>Happy Halloween and see you soon for another game :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d8/6d89ae7fb913d3605b69608890cd5569.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ValwenDynn"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
