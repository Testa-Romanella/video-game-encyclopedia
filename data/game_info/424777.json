Taikou Space Force", "description": "<p>'Taikou Space Force' is a one-stage demo starring a young team of pilots offering a slightly tongue-in-cheek homage to titles like 'Gradius' in a small shoot 'em up engine built in Pixel Game Maker MV.</p>\n<p>In this prototype, players can choose between three different pilots (one of which is not fully completed) and fly through a single stage, shooting basic enemies and collecting power-ups. 2-player multiplayer is even available! Gameplay ends upon appearance of a boss ship.</p>\n<p>(For easy access, the tutorial may be skipped with the Start button)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:12:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/8617a734ab9238e250d06a3421fc061b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Senri Team"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
