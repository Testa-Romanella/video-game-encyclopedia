Monotonous actions that you do by hand distract your brain from unnecessary thoughts and concentrate, allowing you to relax and rest.<br/>Use the spinner in the subway, or spin your spinner while standing in a traffic jam, at home, resting in front of the TV, or before you go to bed.<br/>Do not use the app when you are at an important meeting, at a school lesson or lecture at the institute, or elsewhere where your full attention is required. Remember, this toy relaxes you and distracts, use it wisely.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/950/950532103055f7267abf700e78c04681.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magna Scientia"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
