You can vote for whichever candidate you like best (or none at all), and watch them win or lose the United States presidency. The game has a fully functional Electoral College, and even a House of Representatives\u00a0contingent election in the case of a tie. Have fun generating!</p>\n<p>Also, important to note, as the views of the candidates in this game are randomly generated, they do not reflect the views of anyone who worked on this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T08:02:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/731/7311dcc984e779b1e6c87cfd7aa07c65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TonyCannoli"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
