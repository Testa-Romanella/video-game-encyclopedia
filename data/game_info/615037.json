Armed with the knowledge that you were a High Magus, and that a botched ritual of yours caused the disaster and your amnesia, you must summon your wits, courage, and force of will to rediscover the spell and undo your mistakes.<h3>A treacherous path</h3>Finding the tower's secrets, however, will not be easy, for they're locked tight within your research journal, written on scattered letters, and lying between the lines of Ilar's words.<br/><br/>On top of that, danger waits around every corner - spells that warp your mind and body, sinister creatures who lurk in the dark recesses, and a relationship with Ilar that borders on explosive at times - everything seems to conspire against you.<br/><br/>But all is not lost, for there are fleeting moments of reprieve - an achingly comforting, recovered memory, an unexpected visit from a loyal companion, a touching moment of connection with Ilar - lifelines and breadcrumbs pulling you inexorably toward an unsettling conclusion.<br/><br/>Can you piece together the scattered puzzle of your life? Can you save yourself and Ilar? Can you keep your mind in one piece until the end?<h3>The Remainder Act 1 is a Visual Novel with 40k words</h3><ul><li> Explore a world of ritual magick, pre-industrial technology, and a culture that marries ancient religions of the orient and occident.<br/></li><li>Be lured into an occult world by artwork made to resemble alchemical manuscripts - intricately hand-drawn with pen and ink, then edited and animated digitally to bring to life.<br/></li><li>Immerse yourself in the haunting soundtrack weaved from organic sounds, ceremonial instruments, ritual chanting, and glitch effects.<br/></li><li>Choose who becomes your friend, enemy, or romantic interest.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T03:21:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d7/1d74599626234bf3706931f2ed101155.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Square Weasel Studio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Square Weasel Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
