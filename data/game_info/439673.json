Players have to focus not only on their defense, but also on\r\ntheir offense if they want to improve their chances of winning. The\r\nplayer's offense is determined by which key or button the player\r\npresses while a ball is colliding with their paddle. This gives the\r\nplayer more control over which hitting techniques they use in\r\ndifferent situations during the game. The versatile controls in this\r\ngame allow the player to control the offense in a variety of both\r\nfamiliar and unfamiliar ways. Players can choose and change up their\r\ncontrols on the fly by deciding which combination of keys or buttons\r\nthey want to use in real-time.</p>\n<p>With\r\nthe exception of the Classic Pong game event, all of the rest of the\r\ngame events in this game requires the player to focus their defense\r\nand offense on 2 balls during gameplay instead of just one. This can\r\ncreate situations where the player can be on offense and defense at\r\nthe same time, and it can also create situations where the player\r\nmight be temporarily overwhelmed by 2 balls moving towards their side\r\nof the screen at the same time; which can possibly become more\r\ndifficult to deal with depending on whether or not certain ball\r\ncollisions happen during these situations. There are 16 possible ball\r\ncollisions that can happen when the 2 balls collide with each other.\r\nThese possible ball collisions are determined by which direction the\r\n2 balls are moving in, and also what speed the 2 balls are moving at\r\nwhen they collide with each other. There are also other possible\r\ncollisions that can happen (even during the Classic Pong game event)\r\nwhen a ball collides with a paddle; which can either result in the\r\nball \"staying in play\" or \"going out of play\".\r\nPlayers will only be able to use their offense on a ball if it stays\r\nin play.</p>\n<p>The\r\nAI will adapt to the player's skill level based on how well the\r\nplayer is performing in the game. Although the AI can adapt to the\r\nplayer's skill level, the AI will never become unbeatable. The player\r\njust needs to figure out a way to beat the AI. If the player figures\r\nout a way to beat the AI in each of the game events, they can choose\r\nto play against other players who have done the same in order to find\r\ntheir next level of challenge. The AI in this game is smart and was\r\ndesigned to have a similar play style to some of the players. The AI\r\nis also capable of making split decisions when necessary. In addition\r\nto a smart and adaptive AI, this game also has some hidden in-game\r\nstrategies and easter eggs; but I want the players to discover them\r\non their own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f89067ca3cb7332070882258832035b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["randomess_dj_p"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
