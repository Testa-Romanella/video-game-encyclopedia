My Amiga was undergoing repair and I need a programming fix, so out came my beloved Elk for some BBC BASIC programming.</p>\n<p>I had intended to release the game to public domain but that didn't really happen at the time. In 2002 I converted to a uef file and hosted it on my website where it sat pretty much without any interest until EUG picked it up and hosted it a few years later.\u00a0 I was not happy with the game I made in 1992 as I felt like it was in beta state. In 2020 I made a host of changes and am now pleased to release this much updated version.</p>\n<p>Some of the changes made:</p>\n<p>- Inclusion of a intro section containing backgroundand instructions.</p>\n<p>- Graphical loading screen</p>\n<p>- Improved load/save game error trapping</p>\n<p>- Upper and lower case is now accepted</p>\n<p>- Updated location description and character text</p>\n<p>- More things can be EXAMined and explored</p>\n<p>- Turn counter at the top of the screen</p>\n<p>- Various typo/spelling errors corrected.</p>\n<p><strong>Update History</strong><br/> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 v1.3 (2020) - Much updated 2020 release for BBC Micro / Electron<br/> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 v1.2 (2018) - Converted to BBC Basic for Windows/RISC (based on original 1992 version)<br/> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2002) - Converted to UEF \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 v1.0 - (1992) Initial release.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong><br/> v1.3 - BBC Micro (model B and Master tested); Acorn Electron or under emulation<br/> <strong>Licence</strong><br/> Freeware</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T15:20:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/130/130e28063cf1427a0a8cde792b9cb9bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tony Kingsmill"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
