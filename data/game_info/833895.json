This game may receive updates in the future to reach its intended full scale, however the fate of the project is uncertain. Any gates lacking switches to open them is a consequence of downscaling.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T08:58:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ca/8ca73cb75ce0a62643860696fe90e93c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["buskerdog"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
