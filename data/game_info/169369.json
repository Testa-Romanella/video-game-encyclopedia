The game never ends.</li>\n<li>If you walk or slide off an ice tile without jumping,\r\n  you will have slippery feet until the next time you jump.\r\n\t</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45febac3eea0c6d63135976960728888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Croisant"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
