But growing up a Postboy in training, you may have to learn things the hard way... like how to save your dad from a skeleton dragon, for example. Perhaps there's more to the life of a Post Officer than meets the eye.</p><p>Postboy is equal parts exploration, puzzle solving, and platforming action, with a dash of RPG elements, all coated with delicious pixel art graphics, and served with a side of SNES-era inspired soundtrack goodness. All prepared by chef Seelocanth for your gaming pleasure.</p><p>Windows port by Aidan Lee</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c0/5c079474d295bc94f6c1f1702a13ca2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Seelocanth"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
