Countless alien invasions mean it's a vibrant place to live and biodiversity is at an all time high, although most of it is not too friendly and should be avoided. Humans 2.0 are very friendly however, existing in peaceful harmony with all, thanks partly to the kind programming their AI fathers have bestowed upon them.<br/><br/>Grim Earth is a 2D platform game inspired by SNES/Amiga era gameplay, featuring a blend of action, exploration and some puzzle solving. The game tells an on-going story as you meet new characters, battle alien hostiles and jump, climb, swim, slide and float (zero-g) your way through a variety of locations.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be nice and light, featuring a hand drawn graphical style, a dry sense of humour, frequent save points and it's free of bloody gore ... although there are plenty of explosions, alien splats and flying robot parts!<br/><br/>So grab your spacesuit, customise it, and go on a retro-platform-game adventure.<br/><br/><strong>Coming soon to Steam Early Access ... hope you'll look out for it! : )</strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e99/e9937351c7ddc55218efab536f56bfb1.jpg", "website": "http://Grim.Earth", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["George Allan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Clockwork Pixels"], "esrb_rating": null}
