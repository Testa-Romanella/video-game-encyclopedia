However, you survived and gained a magical power which allows you to control objects telepathically, (oh and you found this sword too, cool!), will you be able to harness this power and unlock it's full potential to survive the onslaught of monsters coming your way, and maybe, cleanse this world to return it to it's once beautiful form? (probably not because we don't have the time to develop it that far yet), or will you succumb to the very same evil that had consumed this land?\u00a0(we hope so, because we're not even close to have\u00a0developed a good ending yet).<br/><br/>Stay Strong-Willed, and Stay Alive!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>A and D to walk</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Space to jump</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mouse to move the sword</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Esc to pause</strong></p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Jerome Janes Matthew Putra - 2D Artist, Programmer, Composer<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Febryan Grady - Programmer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rafhael Wiratna - Project Manager</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tryan Jaya - (Early)\u00a0Level Designer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Garibaldi Britann Abdillah - Game Designer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Muhammad Rifqi\u00a0Adam - Project Supervisor</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T06:02:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/57209f6c8792445a5131d705de544347.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Binus Game Development Club"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
