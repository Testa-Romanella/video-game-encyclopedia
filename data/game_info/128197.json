Thus you will be awoken several times from your cryoslumber to repair the ship before all oxygen depletes and everybody dies!</p>\n<p><strong>Will you survive the 500 light-years journey to Xuriaqs-ZRQ8CSxixuoQ45-RTT#03BR-II?</strong></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>As we are lacking proper in-game screens, the gameplay is explained here.</p>\n<p>You're woken up from your cryo sleep with a briefing screen. There are meteors on a collision course with the CPS-42 and it's your duty to make sure the ship and its passengers survive. You can use the Launch Tactical Nuke button to destroy one of the incoming meteors, possibly saving you time and oxygen!</p>\n\n<p>You wake up in the Life Support (LS) module, you can check the minimap to find where you need to be and which shipmodules (they're flashing) still have breached walls. You can navigate to the correct module using the indications above the doors (and WASD or the arrow keys for movement). We're now going to engineering to get to the Communications bay.</p>\n\n<p>We spot the breached wall instantly. To fix it, get close!</p>\n\n<p>Hold the left mouse button to fix the hole, you should see a progress bar. When the progress bar fills, the hull breach has been repaired.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes there's not enough time to all hull breaches. If the situation becomes too drastic, you may find yourself forced to eject a module. You can do this by finding the lever in the Bridge, with the captain symbol, for the shipmodule you want to eject into deep space.</p>\n\n<p>With the room ejected, the minimap will look like this:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The day is done, the ship is saved, and you can go back to bed. Will you survive the rest of the journey to Xuriaqs-ZRQ8CSxixuoQ45-RTT#03BR-II?</p>\r\nShipmodule Functions\r\n<p>Several modules on the ship have important functions to fullfill and ejecting them from the spaceship might make your journey even more perilous!</p>\n<ul><li><strong>CPS 1-4</strong>: These are the modules containing the sleeping passengers... Your CPS superior will allow you to eject one or two of these modules if no other options are available, but losing all of your passengers is inexcusable!\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>CPU</strong>: The CPU mainframe processes all data traffic of the different shipmodules. Without the CPU, there will be no briefing screen to tell you about the amount and impact angle of any meteors...</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Command Center</strong>: Those pesky meteors can be shot down by launching a tactical nuke by using this submodule. One less hull breach to worry about!</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Bridge</strong>: Ejecting shipmodules is frowned upon, but sometimes it is necessary! The bridge hosts the different levers to eject submodules. With hull breaches all over the place and no way to eject them, oxygen will run out in no time!</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Communications</strong>: Knowing where the meteors are coming from and which modules have a hull breach can help out a lot! Losing this shipmodule will make your job a lot harder!</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><em>Move</em>: WASD or arrow keys</li><li><em>Eject Ship Module</em>: <strong>F</strong></li><li><em>Repair Wall</em>:\u00a0hold the left mouse button when close to the breached wall section</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Team<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Piet Bronders (All-in Development Studios) - Programming</li><li>Alexander De Cock - Programming</li><li>Herv\u00e9 Crespel - 3D</li><li>Laurent Van Acker (All-in Development Studios) - 2D</li></ul>\n<p>Font that was used is\u00a0<em>Disposable Droid BB</em>\u00a0and can be found here:\u00a0Link</p>\n<p>Color Palette is Fleja's Master Palette\u00a0&lt;3<br/></p>\n<p>Made with\u00a0Unity, Blender\u00a0&amp; Aseprite</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eca/eca491b91e8ff4223c2a83cf8aa1a38e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["All-in Development"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
