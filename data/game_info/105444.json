The original concept was to make this story into a short comic strip. By chance, NaNoRenO month came around the corner and changed my mind. It was chaos making this game, but a fun chaos that showed me how much I could truly accomplish.\u00a0I'm proud of my first published game.</p>\n<p>The Making of Bunni and Kitty</p>\n<p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p>\n<p>Ice Queen Studios</p>\n<p>Twitter</p>\n<p>Thank you for viewing my project.
