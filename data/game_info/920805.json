Play as the squirrel, Ratatoskr, on his quest to destroy the world tree. Choose insults within the roots of the tree and deliver them between the dragon, Nidhogg at the base, and the hawk, Vedrfolnir in the canopy. Once their anger reaches its zenith, the tree, and the world, will come crashing down. Look out for the meanest insults on each path. Use the arrow keys to navigate the trees roots.</p>\n<p>Team Lead, Programmer, Artist - Ted Agriogianis</p>\n<p>Music and Sound - Justin Gilbert</p>\n<p>Design, UI Layout, Playtesting - Ted Eichner</p>\n<p>Additional Programming -\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T17:27:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/126/126e724212b7e30cde695ec60f8402dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["tedAgriogianis"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
