{"id": 939661, "slug": "bonified", "name": "Bonified", "name_original": "Bonified", "description": "<p>Overworld: There is somewhat of an \"overworld\" mechanic in our game as well as the primary tile-based movement. When you first start, you will moving around as the skeleton king. This is considered the \"overworld\" and as you move through the graveyard, you'll reach certain points that trigger the actual puzzle portion. You can move around by using the WASD/Arrow keys, and the camera rotates relative to your cursor.\u00a0<br/><br/>Tile-Based\u00a0Movement: When you reach certain points, as mentioned before, you enter the puzzle portion which is tile-based movement. The skeleton king himself cannot move in the tile portion, only the overworld. Your other units that you have will be able to move around though in order to solve the puzzle.<br/><br/>Units: There are 4 different units in the game. The skeleton king, the strength unit, the ranger and the flying unit\u00a0(Skeleton King and strength are in the game with their respective mechanics. Ranger is fully modeled but does not have its mechanics yet.\u00a0Flying unit has yet to be made). The skeleton king's purpose is to move around the overworld and trigger the puzzles. He cannot move within the actual tile-based sections. The strength unit is used to pick up heavy objects such as rocks and carry them around and drop them\u00a0(on a pressure plate in this case).<br/><br/>Buttons: In-game buttons are what power the mechanics, rather than keyboard controls. You'll only see the buttons while you are in the tile portions. \"Swap Right\" and \"Swap Left\" are used to switch between the units (currently doesn't make a difference which you press since the only 2 units on the field are\u00a0the strength unit and the skeleton king). When you have the strength unit selected, you will have an option to \"Move Unit\" \"Pickup\u00a0Entity\" and \"Drop Entity\". Clicking the move button will highlight the tiles on the grid green, showing you how far you can go.\u00a0Clicking on one of the green tiles will move the unit towards it. If you are next to an object that can be picked up (or the skeleton king because he can be picked up too) and click the pickup entity button, it will highlight green underneath the object you are next to and you can click on it to start carrying it. Clicking the drop entity button will allow you to place it down on a tile around you, also highlighted green. The last button is the \"End Turn\" button. You can only move your units once in a turn, so after you have moved, you'll need to click the end turn button and it will reset your move button.<br/><br/>Objective: Currently, the only objective is to move your strength unit to a rock, pick it up, move over to a pressure plate whilst carrying the rock and drop it on it.\u00a0This triggers a gate opening.\u00a0When you move your strength unit to the tile right in front of the gate after opening it, it will exit the tile-based puzzle and put you back into the overworld.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T20:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f5f35159309d19d4f05607ead99800e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CSCC Game Projects"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
