It's a barebones ruleset for running OSR-style RPGs without classes. If you have a library of adventures, bestiaries, and spells, little or no conversion is needed to use them with Coquin. (With light adjustment, newer RPGs can work too!)</p>\n<p>All you need to play are: a Game Master (GM), any number of players, a standard set of 7 gaming dice, some pencil &amp; paper, this zine, and the adventure of your choice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T07:16:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f4/8f489dcc2abcaf755b98984a5a6d63ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maxim Lowe"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
