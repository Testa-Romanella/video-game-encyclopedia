Gentlemen, This is a message from the creator of this game.</p>\n<p>This is not the best game in the world, It isn't the greatest most pleasing too. But let me tell you, The motive and the reason I made this game is to get money so that I can pursue my dream and probably yours too! And that dream is to make Anime girls become 3d for real.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Forget about genetically engineering them, I am making a superadvance AI for them, In short Robots. Much better than humans, much better than anything before it. So I am asking you, Would you donate at least a\u00a0small amount for this to be a reality or die a sad and lonely death?. For once in your life you have the chance to do something that would be loved for years to come, And that chance is right in front of you. All you need is to donate money, at least a small amount. Please... I need your help, Because I cant do this without YOU.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:43:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/181/1814d91d6b45395d854d9d66ed7f2210.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Weebhebin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
