{"id": 720199, "slug": "great-lakes-1815", "name": "Great Lakes 1815", "name_original": "Great Lakes 1815", "description": "<p>I\u00a0submitted this for a game jam because I have never finished anything, I'm learning to code, and I\u00a0just wanted to put something out there. The player is a ship owner trying to make money shipping cargo on the great lakes. This is a prototype I\u00a0apologize for bugs or dead ends. Buy ships, load cargo, go to other harbors to sell cargo to make money. Watch out for bad weather! And don't forget you need some cash to pay your sailors. You will win if you make over 1000 dollars. Sorry there is no art or sound or anything fun. And the pricing is static, but\u00a0I am actually an artist but I wanted to focus on learning the coding part. Maybe I will make this better someday.</p><p>*Update*\u00a0maybe I should explain the history... * The Great Lakes were a major factor in the growth of the upper midwest. In the period when this game starts, people and goods headed west. Later, raw materials also flowed east. The Great Lakes are notoriously fickle and dangerous. In the game, if there is a storm or bad weather, there is a chance your sailing ship will go down - that's pretty true to life. Many ships were lost without a trace; there are 1500 wrecks in Lake Erie alone. In the future I would like to incorporate shipwrecks, and also the role the Great Lakes played in the underground railroad after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in the US, and try to incorporate historical economic and political events.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d63/d63e8493ff2ab11e9862c68d19bdf9a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hawkbit37"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
