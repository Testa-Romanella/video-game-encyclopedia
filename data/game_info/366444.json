Number of seeds affects how many seeds you get from the plant, while pollen amount affects how many different flowers this flower can pollinate, and height modifies how far it can pollinate. Color is just what it says on the tin!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pollination</strong>: Flowers pollinate other flowers in a square centered on them, with the size determined by the flower's height (Range of 2 for short flowers, and 3 for long ones). If the pollination is successful the pollinated flower(s) are ready to be harvested! The seeds have a combination of their parent's genes, with the occasional mutation. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Waterseeker</strong>: Chokka is a desert planet, your duty is ultimately to terraform it into a more hospitable landusing 3 species of waterseekers: plants from a\u00a0foreign planet which have a unique property that allows them to feed water and minerals into desert land, allowing for it to be cultivated.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Scanner</strong>: The scanner allows you to see the genes of a particular flower when you use it on said flower.</p>\n<p><strong>Sprinkler</strong>: Sprinklers water the tiles in a 3*3 square centered on themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: \u00a0Press M to mute in-game music, and N to skip to the next song.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>: Hoe: Plows fields.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>themadprogramer : </strong>Project Manager</p>\n<p><strong>avantgardener :\u00a0</strong>Head of arts<br/></p>\n<p><strong>draketrought :\u00a0</strong>Head of programming<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T04:34:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/146/1467a8584bc23c324d34351212e7e3ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Efegiller"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
