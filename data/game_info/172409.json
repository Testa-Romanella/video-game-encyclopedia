The mechanics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical economy most of the finer points of the game will go over a typical player\u2019s head. There\u2019s also the nihilistic theming, which is deftly woven into the very code, the philosophical messaging draws heavily from S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard's writing, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these game mechanics, to realise that they\u2019re not just deep- they say something hilarious about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Cosmic Road Trader truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in being caught in an impossible situation which itself is a cryptic reference to the struggle of life. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as my genius wit unfolds itself on their monitors. What fools.. how I pity them.</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Patch 1.01-\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>*Every difficulty has its own save file now.<br/>*Get started text file added, just a short introduction to the game.<br/>*UI touch-ups.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e9/5e955886eb9aae38b8ab6601889cfac0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheSZ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
