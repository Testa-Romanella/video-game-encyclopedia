This prototype idea was later picked out as one of twelve games for our first Game Project course where we worked together in teams with other disciplines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game idea itself is about two friends who meet in a dream - one loses its body and becomes a ghost. Use both characters to progress through the levels, don't be too slow or the nightmare will catch up to you.</p>\n<p>Controls: Purple character W,A,S,D &amp; Ghost I,J,K,L + space bar to make it follow the other character.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please not it is a simple prototype which purpose was to show of my idea, I have not balanced anything proper. I would like to remake a lot and create a full game with this idea - but probably rename it. The game created during the game project in school lost a bit of the original vision for the game. You can find that game on FB here\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/promiseofmemory/.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/6532d5ef00fb66e4b90b4f4657a143f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acelyan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
