From there, we slowly built the game \"bit by bit\", but had to completely\u00a0redesign it when they added scrolling\u00a0\u00a0in 2019.</p>\n<p>In March-April of that year, <strong>The New 8-Bit Heroes' Byte-Off</strong> competition arose, and we got to work on a demo for the competition.\u00a0Joe Granato of The New 8-Bit Heroes even told a story about how his kid's first games\u00a0were from the competition.\u00a0The very first of which being... Nessy The NES Robot. And it was this moment that made us motivated even further to continue the game.</p>\n<p>We've continued to improve the graphics, camera, stages, engine and many more since the <strong>Byte-Off</strong> competition.\u00a0We want to thank everyone from that competition &amp;\u00a0The New 8-Bit Heroes for making this game possible.</p>\n<p>If you want to play the original demo featured in <strong>Byte-Off</strong> 2019, visit the New 8-Bit Heroes arcade website.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATES:<br/></strong><em>5/11/2020:<br/></em>-Updated Sprites, Camera, Weapon &amp; Music<br/>-New Title Screen<br/>-New Course<br/>-Fixed a teleport bug.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:20:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c0447cbf2b867552c63548b68ec7e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["DanielTG"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
