In the game you will play as Kai, a young man who has been admitted to The Long River Psychiatric Hospital. Make difficult choices that will affect everyone around you - for better or for worse. <br/><br/>Remember that what you do and say matters, and sometimes helping one person means harming another.<br/><br/>Genre: Psychological thriller, drama, mystery, romance<br/><br/><br/>A severed body found with clear signs of struggle. Police sirens, blood, an ambulance that came too late. No witnesses. No murder weapon on the site.<br/><br/>When the police drag you in for questioning and detective Peng throws a pile of folders on the desk in front of you irritably, spilling some of his morning coffee with the abrupt motion, you already knew that they\u2019ve already found what they were looking for - a person to convict. Whatever you say won\u2019t make a difference - but your history of psychiatric treatment does.<br/><br/>The court deems you mentally unfit to stand trial, and it\u2019s not long before you find yourself in The Long River Psychiatric Center, a place people like you are sent to when they can\u2019t go anywhere else.<br/><br/>To get help...or to be forgotten?<br/><br/><br/>Strangely enough, you get a roommate. It\u2019s almost like a dorm, you think to yourself before your gaze drifts towards the end of the corridor where an aggressive patient lands a punch on one of the nurses and gets restrained by two stalwart guards a second later. Almost.<br/><br/>Your roommate - Moyu was his name, wasn\u2019t it? - is a very quiet man. Very, very quiet, unnaturally so. He doesn\u2019t speak or look at you much, but apparently, this is to be expected. Everyone around says that his understanding is limited, that he is like a child on the inside. <br/><br/>It shouldn\u2019t really surprise you all that much, people are here because they are not okay, but there\u2019s this unnerving spark in his eyes and that quiver to his lips that make you uneasy.<br/><br/>Something feels wrong. <br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li>3 romanceable characters (Moyu, Lian, Xiuying)<br/></li><li>10 unique endings including one mystery ending<br/></li><li>dozens of choices at every step, all impacting your story<br/></li><li>100,000 words<br/></li><li>beautiful CGs and unique art style</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T05:17:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a66/a66e52422ccaeaf3cf5820f74505d7af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 399, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Aedian Glair"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Aedian Glair"], "esrb_rating": null}
