And this game jam theme is really difficult!

This was very much MapleStory inspired but in 3D!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d7/3d7d383c3311760b1f7aeb1bb179a765.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mky786"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
