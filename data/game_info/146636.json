Unfortunately I did not have enough time to create more levels and enemies(or sound), so I make just one \"endless\" level.</p><p>However, the goal is to destroy the white capsules, and \"take\" the human inside. You have 3 lives, which decrease each time you hit a meteorite, or a capsule.</p>Controls:<p>WASD - Move the Earth; </p><p>Left Click - Shoot;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41d22ff109956a3d1a778c4f83fc056f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lagoe"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
