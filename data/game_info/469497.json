I had a chance to have a phone call with him and after that I got the idea to make a game about him where you play as Derrad in his conquest against some famous game characters. If you are a follower of Derrad you will have the most excitement of this game as it's content is based on\u00a0\u00a0Derrad videos, but if you don't know Derrad still you will enjoy seeing some of the famous game characters in an adventure game.</p>\n<p>The whole game is done by a single person and it's\u00a0 made only for fun so it's\u00a0\u00a0totally free would never be commercial, and expect some bugs while playing it :)\u00a0 , these are the known bugs so far:</p><p>-\u00a0 if the first boss didn't fight you, just load the last saved game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T04:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/484b3d4f053f897c81b82e859c6afe3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["walidabuali"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
