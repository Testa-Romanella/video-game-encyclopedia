In \"Kakuro\", you break \n      down the totaled numbers given as hints to fill in the spaces. Well. We \n      say \"break down the numbers\", but in Nikoli's Kakuro very little \n      calculations are actually required, with concentration and the power of \n      deduction being the most necessary attributes. To ensure your long-term \n      enjoyment, we're prepared both a \"Stage Clear\" mode and a \"Random\" mode. \n      In \"Stage Clear\" mode, you progress by clearing puzzles one by one, and \n      in \"Random\" mode puzzles are generated at random. Please enjoy this \n      high-quality \"Kakuro\" game.\n    </p><p>\n      Features\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 In this software, all of the 50 collected questions are produced by \n      Nikoli.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9a080cfdd8dd2656e1a3049a8872eb2.jpg", "website": "http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/products/soft.cgi?3ds&enjk6j", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["HAMSTER", "Co."], "esrb_rating": null}
