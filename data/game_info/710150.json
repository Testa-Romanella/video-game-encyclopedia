This was actually a group project that I made with my partner Tina~ I coded the game and did the backgrounds and animations while Tina drew up the character sprites and helped me when I got stuck on coding. The plot is simple, you're a girl looking for her lost dog. Something ominous is afoot though...\u00a0 Use WASD or the arrow keys to walk and the mouse to click and explore!\u00a0There are easter eggs and jokes I put in the game for my classmates that should be fun when found,</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:35:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db0/db086e08b7834eb9b70013e3697b5820.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ariael's Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
