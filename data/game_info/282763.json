Our very first player. Come, come, I'm not going to bite. I heard you like interactive experiences, don't you? But you must have such little time, whilst you lead a very busy life of scrolling aimlessly through itch.io's library of amateur indie games.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Well, I've got just the thing for you! It's an indie game from a newcomer in the \"bizz\", and get this - it's so short because it's a demo! Seriously, it can't possibly take more than 10 minutes of your time. Won't you try it out? I might be a bit biased being the storyteller and all, but I assure you that it can't possibly be worse than being run over. And that's all we want in life, don't we? To have a better experience than being run over?\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p>On a more serious note, this is my first try at an interactive fiction game. Any comments or points that you might have for me will be invaluable for my progress as a writer/developer, and for the future of this game. Thank you so much in advance!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ea/0eaa063c0df1b6d38d1a5ea513c855c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jonathan_schon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
