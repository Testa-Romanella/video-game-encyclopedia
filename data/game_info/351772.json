{"id": 351772, "slug": "boogie-bot", "name": "Boogie Bot", "name_original": "Boogie Bot", "description": "Boogie Bot is a fast and challenging survival platformer about getting in the zone and finding your groove. Every mechanic in Boogie Bot is designed to keep you moving. Bot-Tom\u2019s battery (health) is constantly draining, so Bot-Tom must keep going and collecting CDs to replenish this fuel. Bot-Tom has an energy supply called the boogie meter, which fills as Bot-Tom runs to the right or drains when he stands still. Bot-Tom is able to use this boogie energy for special abilities like slow motion, air-dash and healing. If the boogie meter reaches a 100% charge then Bot-Tom can BOOGIE DOWN, going invincible for a short time while his speed increases drastically. Bot-Tom can also wave jump, which converts battery life into upward momentum. Many of Bot-Toms abilities shoot sound waves that can harm enemies above, below or behind him.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c8/3c8578415d4abbf1a549518c26c25fdf.jpg", "website": "https://fromtheendgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["From the end Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["From the end Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
