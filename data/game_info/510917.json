Challenge your friends also for the best score within 30 seconds of play time, and play multiple times to try and get the best score you can!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just another concept, I am making lots of work in Unity though for sure, and scripting is becoming somewhat of a breeze, and I am very proud of it. Thinking of watching some first person type tutorials next, and I am currently in the process of learning to model weapons and using Blender ( Also general art projects and such\u00a0) so cooler projects will come in time.</p>\n<p>As for a devlog for any future titles, I am thinking of one, but I will be currently going on deployment soon in the Navy, so making dev logs won't\u00a0 be easy to always do all the time. If I do make one and go on deployment right after, what I can do is basically create a devlog that has 6 months of work, and on one complete devlog for a game, ill bold the words\u00a0 to label a week. If this doesn't make sense now, I wouldn't worry about it, until you see the product itself, but its an idea.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Same as every other title, don't expect any future updates on this, and if I do, expect them to come slowly or just a random bug fix here or there but Ill throw out a \"future idea\" list, as a just in case I want to come back here for inspiration or an update.</p>\n<p>Ideas:</p>\n<p>Add Random Level Selector.<br/></p>\n<p>Add an Ability to let players create their own timers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Add an ability to make the \"I do something\"\u00a0button turn from making a block red to making cubes fall from the sky ( could of done it here but didn't feel for it ).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T05:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc23391a98650a8e2e2592dc279feec3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mideons"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
