All you have to guide you is your trusty bell and the things around you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Using [Space] you can ring your bell, allowing to see in a small area around you. There are also various other items in the cave that can help you see and guide you towards the exit.</p>\n<p>Currently there are only three levels for you to progress through (plus a tutorial level), however if the game receives good feedback, we will consider creating more levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Adrian Oladeji - Production / Sound design</li><li>Harry Miller - Programming / Quality assurance</li><li>Jaydon Hart - Designer / Co-artist</li><li>Matthew Wilson - Artist / Co-designer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T05:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73d/73d4689c24e331970458786240be75fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Haarry"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
