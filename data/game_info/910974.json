It's tough. It's technical. It's here for you.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>CURRENTLY A BETA</p>\n\n<p>============================================</p>\n<p>Get $500 and escape. Get a high score. Read the controls, and off you go.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>SHIP CONTROLS</p>\n<p>- A/D: rotate ship</p>\n<p>- W: accelerate (also generates approximately 0.12-0.25 energy per second)</p>\n<p>- S: brake (approximately 1 energy per second)</p>\n<p>- space: cannon (costs 1 energy)</p>\n<p>- H: hyperspeed/hyperstop (costs 1 energy)</p>\n<p>- J: flip ship</p>\n<p>- K: tri-shot (costs 3 energy)</p>\n<p>- L: gravitational wave (G-wave) (energy cost displayed on screen)</p>\n<p>- E: pause game</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>============================================</p>\n<p>GUIDE (YOU DONT NEED TO READ THIS PART)</p>\n<p>============================================</p>\n<p>THE GAME</p>\n\n<p>- Destroying an enemy increases your score.</p>\n\n<p>- Energy pickups appear on screen. Picking them up increases your energy.</p>\n\n<p>- There's an easy mode you can activate in the pause menu by pressing the gravitational wave button while paused within the first few seconds of the game. You can only do this when you're set to \"lonely\", not \"popular\" in the pause screen.</p>\n\n<p>============================================</p>\n\n<p>SAVEGAMES</p>\n<p>Saving is automatically done at the pause screen and upon death. Your game is loaded when you run the game.</p>\n\n<p>============================================</p>\n\n<p>MANEUVERABILITY</p>\n\n<p>Your ship is agile but requires training to get use of its full abilities.</p>\n\n<p>- Accelerating increases your energy. This happens slowly, at low speed, and quickly at high speed.</p>\n\n<p>- Using your brakes consumes energy.</p>\n\n<p>- Flip:</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = the ship can instantly turn 180 degrees on command</p>\n\n<p>- Hyperspeed:</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = use the hyper button while moving slowly to instantly reach high speed</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = costs energy</p>\n\n<p>- Hyperstop:</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = use the hyper button while moving quickly to instantly stop in place</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = costs energy</p>\n\n<p>============================================</p>\n\n<p>WEAPONRY</p>\n\n<p>You have four weapons, the cannon, the tri-shot, the gravitational wave, and the hyperbomb.</p>\n\n<p>- Cannon:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = The cannon is fast and direct</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = costs 1 energy</p>\n\n<p>- Tri-shot:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = the tri is slow but covers a wide area</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = costs 3 energy</p>\n\n<p>- Gravitational Wave (G-wave):\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = the wave destroys all enemies on screen and resets the maximum timer</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = each time you use it, the energy cost to use it increases</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = current energy cost is displayed on screen</p>\n\n<p>- Hyperbomb:</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = when you reach extreme speed, you break the particle barrier and destroy all enemies on screen</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 = recharges instantly at low speed</p>\n<p>============================================</p>\n\n<p>ENEMY ASSAULT</p>\n\n<p>The timer shows how long it will be between enemy arrivals. This reduces as you destroy enemies, but you can reset it by using the gravitational wave.</p>\n\n<p>The enemy arrival time shows when the next spawn will occur.</p>\n\n<p>============================================</p>\n\n<p>UPGRADES</p>\n\n<p>Upgrades will appear on the game field. Pick them up before they disappear. Each icon upgrades something different. The levels for each upgrade can be viewed on the pause screen.</p>\n\n<p>============================================</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T14:31:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b8/5b8f4c004f8dbf7ac5cb39fe738ed38a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["donstathemonsta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
