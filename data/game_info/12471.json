The game will package with a small amount of music, but the aim is for players to have their own soundtrack and play to the music they love! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour paddle's momentum has a direct effect on the ball. The faster you move, the faster the ball will get. Keep rallying to get the ball to insane speeds! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDesigned for 1-4 players using local play, pick from one of five game modes and maps. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGet the ball past your opponent to score a point, first to 11 points wins in normal mode, first to 21 in Chaos! <br/>\n<br/>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGAME MODES <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- 1 vs AI : Vanilla Technoball against a variety of bot difficulties <br/>\r\n- Normal mode : Technoball with periodic item spawns.
