Your goal is to run as far as possible and avoid EVERYTHING that stands in your way. That includes the walls and the black obstacles you'll see while playing. <em>Okay not really everything: the one thing it's okay to touch are the white diamonds which will eventually work as currency to buy alternative backgrounds (not implemented yet).</em></p><p>One thing I want to note because I'm pretty proud of it is that the colors slowly fade from one to another as you keep playing. Right now the colors are completely random (inside set ranges) but I'm thinking of having options to:</p><ul><li>Use one colors for the whole run</li><li>Have the colors be from a limited preset of hand chosen ones</li></ul><p>This is pretty much it, it's a really tiny game but I think it can become quite fun. </p><p>I need feedback so tell me what you think, both in terms of gameplay, if you run into any bugs or stuff like that, suggestions about things to add/change/fix/remove etc. anything.</p><p>In the meantime, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77f/77f30e6254b0a5bfc8a7523815e4fba7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["SquareDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
