That's why we want to speak to people using a language that is easily understood by everyone. We listen to no politics, our believes are made by the communities we build ourselves.\u00a0 Music is the answer! We communicate through the beats of our favorite songs, and we share it with other through cassettes. Yeah, we are like 30 years late... but that's the magic of it. So don't be shy,   share your beliefs through music with us or with others or jam alone by playing 3 catchy tracks (for now).\u00a0 Nail the beat alone or with a friend and let the music guide you. That's our only policy! <br/></p>\n<p>Elias Fedorenko - Coding</p>\n<p>Chris Triantafyllou - Art</p>\n<p>George Kokolios - Scoring &amp; SFx</p>\n<p>Instructions: Use Space &amp; Down to control the players and start to nail notes (We used custom buttons for the project that we made while attending the game jam... seriously).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5d/d5d6dcf37a2c711d6ba9bff55afce18b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Broko"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
