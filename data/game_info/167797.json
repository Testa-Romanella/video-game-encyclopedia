It's going to take all the mustache you have to jump and double-jump to the ever-ominous STANDING DESK and avoid a hot, bubbly death. As you progress further, the desks start coming faster and faster so you'll have to control the speed at which you fall in addition to leaping like a lemur. Try to beat the high scores of your friends and family with a local scoreboard. </p><p>Fast fun for all ages.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c89/c8927516d66ccb20b5d2eee58ce066a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Clockwork Demon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
