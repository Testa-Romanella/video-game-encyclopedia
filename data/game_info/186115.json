The game runs on Mac OS with the .app file, and Windows/Linux with the .jar file. This is still VERY incomplete, and please only download this for testing purposes. Any recommendations are highly appreciated!</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>HOW TO PLAY:</p><p>You are a cat named Sasa. Travel your way around the weird repetitive world trying to find new land. As you go along, you can make your fortune from collecting apples and wheat, and selling them at local shops.</p><p>CONTROLS:</p><p>W is Forward</p><p>A is Left</p><p>S is Backwards</p><p>D is Right</p><p>I am SO sorry for the inconvenience, but at this stage in the game, holding down the movementbuttons does not work. you have to repetitively tap them to get Sasa to move. I am working on a patch, and will release it as soon as it is ready.</p><p>Thank you, and I hope you enjoy Sasa's Adventure.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bd275b698abd7b28230e241365d5c8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matthew92007"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
