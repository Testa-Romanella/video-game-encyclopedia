Fear not, your friendly local mega-corporation has built Deep Space Nine Lives, where free range, fully organic furballs roam free, before being specially picked out and packaged, and shipped down to Earth just for you!<br/><br/><strong>Epic MegaJam 2019<br/></strong><br/>This game was built in one week for the Epic Megajam 2019 with the dual themes of 'Down to Earth', and 'Space Cats'. This game is both under 100MB and\u00a0intended for network multiplayer (2-4 players) - though it may be best suited for lower-ping environments due to the complexity of the networking solution.<br/><br/>There are two file archives available:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>FourFriskyFelines-CorporateAcquisitionTargetsInSpace-Smol.zip <br/></strong>The main submission, the game coming in at just 47MB.</li><li><strong>FourFriskyFelines-CorporateAcquisitionTargetsInSpace.zip\u00a0</strong><br/>A backup version using a different binary - still under 100MB, included in case there are issues with the former (some aggressive anti-virus programs do not like binaries compiled in certain formats).</li></ul>\n<p>More information about Epic Megajam, and other entries, can be found here;<br/></p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/2019-epic-megajam<br/><br/><strong>Playing the Game</strong><br/><br/>This is a competitive action / strategy game for 2-4 players; pick either Red Shift or Blue Shift, and compete to fill your three cargo containers with cats of the correct type - you'll get paid handsomely for the correct cats, but be warned, you pay will be docked for the wrong ones too (...or maybe use this to your advantage and foil your opponents?). Once both teams have filled their containers, or the game time has run out, the team with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>Should you find yourself cash-rich, or need to get back ahead, you can always purchase a Subwoofer or some Tasty-Treats from a convenient nearby vending machine; cats hate the Subwoofer, but boy do they love Tasty Treats.<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/><br/>A game-pad is recommended to play this game, but not necessary.<br/><br/>Keyboard:</p>\n<ul><li>W - Accelerate</li><li>S - Reverse</li><li>A / D - Turn Left / Right</li><li>X - Honk Horn / Use Item</li><li>Esc - Quit Game (Main Menu has Quit button)</li></ul>\n<p>(Xbox) Gamepad:</p>\n<ul><li>Right Trigger - Accelerate</li><li>Left Trigger - Reverse</li><li>Left Stick - Turn Left / Right</li><li>A - Honk Horn / Use Item</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Team</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All-Star Voice Acting\u00a0Cast\u00a0Cats<br/><br/>Humans:<br/>Alex - Game Art<br/>Ambershee - Game Design &amp; Programming<br/>Cephalo - Music &amp; Sound<br/>TheKaosSpectrum - Core Programming</p>\n<p><strong>OST<br/></strong>https://soundcloud.com/cephalojams/sets/cat-acquisition-targets-in-space</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:29:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e04275179af3d09ae261e95db98104a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ambershee", "Nuna00", "cephalo", "KaosSpectrum"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
