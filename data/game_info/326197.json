Together, two players will work to connect the Ehrenfeuchts and Fra\u00efss\u00e9s by bridges. This is an asymmetric game for two players with very distinct roles:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Player 1 is called <strong>Selector</strong>. On their turn, Selector selects either an Ehrenfeucht or a Fra\u00efss\u00e9 (dot above or below the river) that hasn't been connected by a bridge yet.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Player 2 is called <strong>Bridger</strong>. On their turn, Bridger picks a dot on the other side of the river that hasn't been connected yet, and connects it to the dot Selector picked via a bridge. Bridges cannot cross.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>If either player cannot pick a dot, the game is over.</p>\n<p>The two players also have very distinct goals: Player 1 (Selector)'s goal is to end the game as quickly as possible. Player 2 (Bridger)'s goal is to keep the game going as long as possible.</p>\n<p>What's going on? Ehrenfeucht Fra\u00efss\u00e9 Games are a key tool in Model Theory, a branch of mathematical logic concerned with what logical statements are true or false for various mathematical structures. Player 1 (who is called Spoiler in Model Theory)'s goal is to exploit the differences between the collection of dots above the river and the collection of dots below. Player 2 (who is called Duplicator in Model Theory) then tries to\u00a0take advantage of the similarities between the two collections of dots.</p>\n<p>For instance, suppose that there are 2 dots above the river and three dots below. The difference Player 1 will try to exploit is that in the 3 dot collection, there is a point which is neither furthest to the left or to the right, or, written in the language of logic, there is a dot x such that there is a dot y with y &gt; x and there is a dot y with y &lt; x. This difference has two variables in it, and it takes Player 1 two turns to exploit it. This isn't a coincidence: any difference becomes a strategy for player 1, and it takes one turn for each variable needed to write it down.</p>\n<p>Hence the purpose of the game: it's sometimes easier to figure out the winning strategy on a game than it is to figure out the logical difference between two structures. A model theorist can then turn that strategy into a logical formula describing the difference.</p>\n<p>The collections of dots above and below the river do not have to be finite: any subset of the real number line will do, including the positive integers, the integers, the rational numbers, etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T21:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/147d52070688d95b9e7a111d0ad7eadb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["trkern"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
