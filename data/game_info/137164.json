The theme was\u00a0<strong>Small World</strong>. This is my second time entering a game jam (and building a stand alone game really). All feedback is greatly appreciated - and thank you for putting up with the shoddy art work - I'm working on my graphic art skills!</p>\n<p><strong>AIM</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to collect as food circles as you can before you get killed by the fire or there are no food circles left.</p>\n<ul><li>All food has a points remaining value, e.g 3, when the food is picked up you will gain score equal to the points remaining.</li><li>Picked up food will respawn somewhere else on the map with 1 less score.</li><li>Food with a score of 1 will not respawn when collected.</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-&gt;\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is controlled with the left mouse click. The mouse is used to navigate the world as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Tiles around the player that are valid to move to will be highlighted green.</li><li>Clicking on a tile will map a path to that tile, clicking again on the tile will begin a movement along that path.</li><li>Clicking on a tile less than\u00a0your max range will allow you to select a second tile inside of a reduced range. This lets you plan your own navigation through tight spots.</li><li>Clicking on a white or invalid move tile will cancel the current planned movement.</li><li>A move can't be stopped once it's begun, and you can't begin another move until your current one is complete - use this time to think!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>FIRE AND TIME FREEZE</strong></p>\n<p>Fire spreads from the corners of the map as the game progresses, shrinking your world and threatening to kill you and your food.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, you have the ability to freeze time while moving! Use this to give you time to think - but beware picking up food will break your concentration and make you unable to freeze time for a few seconds!</p>\n<p><strong>MOVING FOOD</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Stopping in a tile next to a food circle will cause you to bump that food\u00a0 circle one tile away from you. Use this to position multiple tiles near each other and grab them all in one move - reducing how long\u00a0you can't freeze time for!</p>\n<p>Be careful though, don't knock the food into the fire!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/80139d368c0ff1f683dfa352d59d81fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["G Pennefather"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
