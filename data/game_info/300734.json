A simple operation to arson the garbage was successfully carried out, but with its subsequent extinguishing the situation was more complicated.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrom the landfill, the fire spread to the coal deposits that remained in the mine, which, as coal is supposed to, began to burn quite successfully, and the fire was constantly spreading through the territory of the already inactive mine workings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome time after the incident, the state finally paid attention to the scale of the problem and allocated funds for its solution.
