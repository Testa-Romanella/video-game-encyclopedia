In this process, gradually retrieve memories and use various means to achieve goals. Provide companionship, assistance, or services (massage, etc.) to girls in daily life to enhance their liking for you, break through layers of spiritual and physical barriers, and ultimately form a strong connection with the girl to complete the final task.
