This was my 3rd Amiga game, originally released in March 1992.</p>\n<p>Liberator is a vertical shooter, inspired by the C64 game Panther and\u00a0the look of\u00a0SWIV. This was my first game to feature scrolling, even my old Commodore 64 games didn't manage it, and also my first game to feature an integrated music player. You have one life here, only one shot in the air at once, and the enemies take a lot of killing, so it is a difficult game which reviewers of the time hated.\u00a0It has its charms however, and was certainly a technical step-up from my first two games.</p>\n<p>One thing to note: the aim of the game is to 'land' on the arrowed platforms and rescue 100 people (which you can only identify from the footstep sounds).</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T07:23:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/732/73207039ecff053f317045a92fdda9b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
