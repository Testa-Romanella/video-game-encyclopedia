Their lives are in your hands!<br/><br/>---- DESCRIPTION ----<br/><br/>Which one is the smallest of the worlds? A super-globalized Earth? Life inside an ant colony? Pluto? When we thought about it for a while, we realized the smallest of the worlds may be something oppressive instead.<br/><br/>Think about a cage.<br/><br/>Think about having each day less space to live.<br/><br/>Think about someone controlling and limiting all your actions, every day.<br/><br/>Think about living only to serve and die.<br/><br/>Think about not being human in this world.<br/><br/>We created the smallest of the worlds\u2026 but it might not be the world we enforce the animals to live in. The smallest of the worlds could also be our narrow mind, every time we refuse to see what we are really doing :\u2019(<br/><br/>\u00bfWHY MINIGAMES?<br/><br/>We wanted to \u201ctalk\u201d about as many topics as possible, so we though a bunch of simple-but-addictive mini games would fit this goal. Inspired by Wario Ware games like \u2018Dumb Ways To Die\u2019 we wanted \u2018SAVE\u2019 to feel friendly but meaningful at the same time. Hope we achieved it!<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>Regarding In-App Purchases: <br/>IAPs removes ads.<br/>We'll donate our part of the proceeds to WWF. <br/>We'll publish the amount donated each month through our social media!<br/>*No internet connection needed.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>This game is made by a young passionate team so we really appreciate your feedback ^-^<br/><br/>We really hope you enjoy our game!
