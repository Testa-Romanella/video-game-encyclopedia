I built it from scratch using Unity so don't expect it to play as good as the original fnf\u00a0 <em>:/\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 (og fnf is a master piece!!!)</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>(Theres only 1 playable song here (Rulay) and its 3.2 minutes long)</em><br/></p>\n<p>This game was supposed to release on mobile platforms only.... but yeah things didn't go so well and we wanted to give iOS users a backdoor to play this. SO NOW ITS ON PC BROWSERS!!! HOORAY!!</p>\n<p>The game is buggy on the browser so if ya have an android go get it on google play!!\u00a0 This was a fun project to work on. Hope ya'll stick around till the end and watch those credits roll / play that secrete game mode, I'd appreciate it!</p>\n<p>Also for anyone who likes <strong>FREE</strong> stuff check the link below, I've made the art assets I created for this project free to download.
