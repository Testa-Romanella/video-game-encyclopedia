The sentient robots have escaped and are hungry for both revenge and crunchy humans. Your passengers are panicked and running in all directions. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are their only hope. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRace across the crash site to save the passengers, while you blast apart the ungrateful robots. Avoid the landmines planted by the nasty droids. Dodge the dreaded auto-tracking laser cannons. Keep your eye out for the flying saucer and its painful destructo-beam.  And, oh, sometimes your ray guns don't quite shoot straight.  But you'll figure it out -- right?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd whatever you do, don't forget to have fun. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBattle your way through multiple waves of rouge robots to avoid being SWARMED in this retro, heart pounding game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T05:51:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/428fef21992ba3255f4a6c7b340b9a24.jpg", "website": "https://swarmedgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Colin Dougherty"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Novation Tech"], "esrb_rating": null}
