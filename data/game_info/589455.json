This\u00a0led me to the idea of \"bullet crates\" that attack the boss when opened, and\u00a0can be hit from any direction to set it flying.\u00a0If you hit it from the right direction you can sometimes set off a chain reaction and do a lot of damage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e3/6e3a845ffc6cc171d720a356c4447cff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Guy Unger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
