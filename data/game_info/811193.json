Armed with nothing but yourself, you'll fling your own segments at your enemies, only to\u00a0frantically try to retrieve your lost limbs\u00a0afterwards.</p>\n<p>In this game your ammo count doubles as your health bar.\u00a0 Every time you shoot , you lose a little bit of health. Likewise, if you get hit too much, you won't be able to shoot. But lucky you! You can go recollect any lost segments! That way you'll be able to bust even more bugs!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 109th Mini Jam, a bi-weekly, 72-hour game jam.\u00a0 Seeing as this was our first game jam (and first proper game for that matter),\u00a0 we weren't able to make everything we had planned for this game. Enemy variety is -quite- a bit lacking, and the game lacks a substantial amount of polish.\u00a0 Worst of all, we weren't able to bust al the bugs in our code :(.</p>\n<p>Due to some technical issues this game has been submitted late</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Shoot the spiders crawling around. Every once in a while, an anthill will appear, with extra fast ants scurrying out of them. Walk over one to close it.\u00a0Any segments lying around can be picked up by touching 'em.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>You have to take wide turns or it won't respond well</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>A whole lot of bugs (both kinds)</li><li>X-tremely good pixel-art graphics</li><li>A pause menu</li><li>A bustin' good time</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>Controller (Recommended):</strong></p>\n<p>Left Stick: Move and Aim</p>\n<p>Any trigger shoulder button: Shoot</p>\n<p>Start/Select: Start game and Pause</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard (not recommended):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD/Arrows: Move and Aim</p>\n<p>Spacebar/Shift/Enter: Shoot</p>\n<p>Esc/P: Pause</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse (easy mode):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left click: Move</p>\n<p>Right click: Shoot</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Iotagamer69: Game designer, coordinator,</p>\n<p>SpeedyCodes:\u00a0 Programmer</p>\n<p>Wimser_Rat: Artist</p>\n<p>Music provided by\u00a0<em>https://www.FesliyanStudios.com</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:44:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9347a40e86fbffc4d9ead0f068d56d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Iotagamer69", "pedesova", "SpeedyCodes"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
