It took me quite some time to figure out who to tackle next but Gamzee's route was drafted honestly by surprise. I spent some time in inpatient care for mental health very recently. As Gamzee is a coping character to me, I soon found my journaling exercises were a real muse for writing this. It's been important to me, to the point I revised it multiple times, typed it up and put it in a presentable route.</p>\n<p>My goal is to target another facet of Gamzee that people may not think about, especially people who don't have the sort of thoughts that mentally ill people may have. I wanted to acknowledge his parental neglect, and show his emotions from that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:09:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/650/6508375105e3fbe036b2ae13c688c9c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["tavr1spr1te"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
