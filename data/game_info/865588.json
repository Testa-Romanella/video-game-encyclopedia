It's about herding cats. Each level has a goal, and your job is to get the troublesome cats into that goal as quickly as possible using a variety of fun items!<br/><br/><strong>HERD!</strong><br/><br/>Use items like tuna, your computer keyboard and Cat Snax\u2122 to draw cats towards the goal. Use scarier items like a barking robot dog to push them in whichever direction you please. Use more chill items like the music box to put them to sleep while you figure out a plan of attack. Use the cat trap to move multiple cats quickly! Create chaos with the cat cannon!<br/><br/><strong>COOPERATE!</strong><br/><br/>Coordinate with your friends in 2-4 player split-screen (Steam Remote Play/Parsec friendly!) to get the cats to the goal as quickly as possible. <br/><br/><strong>SET RECORDS!</strong><br/><br/>Compete to finish each level in the fastest time with gold, silver and bronze medal times. We'll add online leader boards in the future!<br/><br/><strong>SPOOKY!</strong><br/><br/>New Halloween map!
