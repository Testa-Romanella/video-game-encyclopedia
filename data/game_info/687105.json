Their tummies grumble for a tasty treat, and hangry they'll be when they don't get to eat. Souls and fear are their primary diet, but the candy this night is what makes them riot. No one else will offer their sugary treats. It's up to you to save your town's streets!\r\n</p>\n<p>Tricky Treat is a spooky Trick or Treating simulation game. Your goal is to stop a mysterious cauldron accompanied by\u00a0villainous monsters from devouring the town by sacrificing your Halloween candy.
