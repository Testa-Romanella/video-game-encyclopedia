A slightly oldschool and hardcore, with the original mechanics and different ways for passing!<br/><br/>The player controls the car, which has many obstacles along the way from other cars and repair pits. Mad scientists from the organisation StopTime stopped time on the track and gave player's car the ability to instantly move in space. They placed in the way a lot of power-ups so these tracks can be completed.<br/><br/>Three ways of play - fast passage, collection of coins and collection of atoms.<br/> <br/>The mechanics in the game are a little hard for beginners, but eventually you can get used to it and get the most hardcore achievements!<br/><br/><ul><li>16 main levels<br/></li><li>9 short levels<br/></li><li>3 types of power-ups<br/></li><li>3 ways of play for medals</li></ul>Main features<ul><li>Turn-based racing<br/></li><li>A dynamic puzzle game<br/></li><li>Original mechanics<br/></li><li>Hardcore rules<br/></li><li>Pleasant music and atmosphere<br/></li><li>Different variants for passing<br/></li><li>Easter eggs</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f5/8f5a57e2968a479778829ace7b868acf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 75, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["vaniloput games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["vaniloput games"], "esrb_rating": null}
