There are 2 game modes available.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCure\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal is to cure the patient from the disease by clicking on the infected cells to remove them. Be quick, 2 new cells spawns every 2 seconds. In this mode, you can finish the game before the timer goes out by removing all the infected cells. The faster you are, the bigger will be your score bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpread\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal is to spread the virus by producing the more infected cells as possible during the given time. When you click on a cell, it divides into two new cells (so you have +1). Be careful not to spam too much though because when you click outside of a cell, you score decrease (that mechanic is in the other mode as well).\r\n\r\n\r\nRelevance to the theme\r\n<p>Well, I tried to use \"two\" as much as possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2D game (does it count?)</li>\n<li>2 game modes available</li>\n<li>Cure: 2 cells spawn every 2 seconds</li>\n<li>Spread: when a cell is clicked, 2 more appear</li>\n<li>Timer of 22 seconds</li>\n</ul>\r\nExternal assets/resources\r\n<ul>\n<li>Used LeanTween (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595)</li>\n<li>Fonts: \r\n         <ul>\n<li>Eater Font by Vernon Adams (https://www.1001fonts.com/eater-font.html)</li>\n<li>Rocky Mountain (https://www.1001fonts.com/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever-font.html)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:14:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bd0375923fdfdc8d4d84210ff89d0b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hitinui"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
