Are you really a monster?</em></p>\n<p>This game was made in one month for Metroidvania Month 19. The theme was \"you are the monster\".</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard and Gamepad are both supported, but most of my testing was with a gamepad, so I'd use that if you have one.</li><li>The area load times are a bit longer than I'd like, but they do load. It should be under a minute, and it's faster when returning to an area.</li><li>I ran out of time for sounds and music.</li><li>The game isn't finished, so play as far as you feel like. Getting the medicine to the sick man can be considered an end point.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-04T00:47:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a2/7a2ad1c415be33746554ce3818c5d2ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DivFord"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
