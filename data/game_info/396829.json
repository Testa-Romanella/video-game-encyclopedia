Series of minigames with Tournament mode. Race lawnmowers, grow tomatoes, dodge rotten fruit and more!<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>We wanted to say there is <em>sadly </em><strong>no single player</strong>, but then, that\u2019s the point. Crowd around one device like we used to back in the day\u2026 when everything was just a little bit nicer.<br/></p>\n<p>We would really appreciate it if you gave it a go and let us know what you think by leaving a review on the Play Store. We aren\u2019t asking for 5-star reviews, please be honest and help us make our game better :)</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT ABOUT THESE\u00a0GAMES THEN?<br/></strong><br/>You can get it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameljnegames.couchparty<br/><br/>The minigames include lawn mowing, veggie grab, veggie pong, apple picking, mower race, tomato growin\u2019 and battle bugs.</p>\n<p>Genre-wise the minigames are mostly a test of speed and accuracy, perception and reflexes, with exception of Battle Bugs which is either a strategy or a screen mashing competiton.</p><p>Party mode is also included, which is just a fancy way of saying tournament.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>FUTURE PLANS</strong><br/>If this collection gets some traction you can expect a lot more mini games, less bugs, better graphics &amp; sound and overall a better experience. If not, well, I guess we\u2019ll have to make some silly idle game or match-3 or something.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>Ozz &amp; Cookie \u2013 blood, sweat, tears / code, design, graphics<br/>Freesound.org \u2013 some sounds\u00a0<br/>Pikica \u2013 being the fluffiest cat ever<br/>Scirra \u2013 for coming up with Construct, because who wants to learn actual programming :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T05:03:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/469/469fdb3ac20dfd6ac779ce8277ad35fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gameljne Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
