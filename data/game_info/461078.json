So I wrote this small game with 5 single player levels where you can challenge yourself to be the best times per level.</p>\n<p>The game also features 5 two player levels in a split screen format so you can race your friends.</p>\n<p>If you find the game too difficult there's a casual mode with no death. Alternatively if you're the kind of player who's collected every strawberry and C-side in Celeste there's\u00a0a crazed mode which makes the levels even harder.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:13:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/806/8069756f68d1425ba0da1dfdf0cc3cb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carleton Handley"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
