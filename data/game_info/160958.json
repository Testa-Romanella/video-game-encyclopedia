When the game is in progress, Player 2 can join by pressing either of the P2 action buttons.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in collaboration with Qendrim Hoti for our art show\u00a0Galaxy Champion FUN ZONE. That exhibition centered around using modified/hacked video games to insert personal migrant histories into a variety of virtual worlds. Space Kilim was an game created by Hoti and I to explore how 8-bit graphics have an uncanny aesthetic similarity to the motifs found in woven rugs.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0kilim\u00a0is a hand woven rug found in Morocco, Turkey, and Albania. The motifs used in the game are from a number of textiles in Qendrim\u2019s collection.</p>\n<p>In the art show where this was used, the game was played via a ceiling mounted projector which projected the game down onto a white fur rug. This is mostly why the game has no \"interface\" and no score-keeping: a simple and direct visual presentation in the gallery made more sense.</p>\n<p>While no code was copied, this game was heavily inspired by this:\u00a0https://ztiromoritz.github.io/pico-8-shooter/. Also, for now, the music was borrowed from Star Fox 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d9/9d9128e233371d5f69e27a68b163973a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hotiqendro"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
