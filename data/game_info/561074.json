Your overly enthusiastic Captain sends you on missions to help your nation, where you start to question why you're really here and what you're really doing.</p>\n<p>Note: There is no audio, as my time management skills are lacking and I put it off for too long on the jam version.</p>\n<p>I've put a link to the source code in the game info, if you're interested.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T04:38:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd407c0e4de53188a0bee1147488e7c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Syldarion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
