{"id": 13551, "slug": "zone-of-lacryma", "name": "Zone of Lacryma", "name_original": "Zone of Lacryma", "description": "Zone of Lacryma is a story driven 2D shooter inspired by the classic shmups but with a couple of twists. You will be flying through custom built levels, trying to get a new highscore or the fastest time possible. Multiple weapons that behave differently give room for different ways to play. A charge system that lets you balance how offensive or defensive you want to be. An upgrade system that customizes your ship even further. And a deep and rich story that leads you through your missions, giving everything purpose.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abc/abc34486f142be8fd2b19cc9dfe956b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oophok"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["oophok"], "esrb_rating": null}
