His specialty is splicing animals and joining them together! You\u2019ve been restrained and etherized, but (somewhat) lucky for you, the Doctor couldn\u2019t help himself and has sliced off your forearm. You must use your recently severed limb to free yourself from your shackles and break free before the madman can get slice up the rest of you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:36:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66f/66fc4ba6bcb4637c1257e189a207be7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Your Enbassy Sudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
