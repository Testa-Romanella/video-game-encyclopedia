Or mouse wheel zoom will be frustrating :)</p>\n<p>Asteroids also randomly spawn and head toward the \"black hole\".<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy! Not sure if I will attempt to make this into more of a \"real\" game but maybe someone else will be inspired :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T07:42:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd6/cd6f4502b6b0e0e537e273b81eaf4beb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FoozleGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
