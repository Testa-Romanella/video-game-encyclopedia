The turtle can hide from the owl behind the trees and thus remain safe while unseen. Once seen, only the lake will shield you from the owl but not from the snake.</p>\n<p>There is a trick to pass the snake though; can you figure it out? And there are ways to get a break from the owl too. Patience, patience, that's the key word. We hope this game makes you laugh while discovering a strategy to reach your energy goal in such a hostile environment.</p>\n<p>This game is a parent-child team project and\u00a0the second of a series themed on the interactions between herbivores, carnivores, plants, and energy, illustrating how herbivores balance grazing with escaping from predators (carnivores) and how such balance affects their net energy.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy it and let us know your comments!!!</p><p>If you enjoyed this game, you may also enjoy FastSloth &amp; CrazyGator at\u00a0https://dagovenera.itch.io/sloth-gator<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T07:02:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/2493029b2ebf9cf80f028e7c8e6984ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["dagovenera"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
