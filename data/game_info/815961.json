It killed many villagers and caused misery among the whole\u00a0community. One day however, a note was left and found at the entrance of the village. There was a picture of a blacked out\u00a0creature with empty white eyes, white nose, and big white smile. That creature called itself \"Bunny\". It claimed\u00a0on the note that it could help the village rid itself of the plague for an annual price. The villagers left a note of their\u00a0own asking how Bunny could help. Bunny left a note the day after ordering the villagers must sacrifice one of their own\u00a0every year to Bunny by sending them out into the woods to travel to Bunny's cave so it can find them and eat them. If the villagers stop the\u00a0tradition, the plague will return and kill you all.</p><p>To decide who to sacrifice each year, your village set up the Wheel of Sacrifice. Every year, the wheel spins and lands on the name of an 18+ year old villager who will then be sent out to be sacrificed to Bunny.<br/></p>\r\nThere are 3 endings:\r\n<p>-True Ending</p>\n<p>-Good Ending</p>\n<p>-Bad Ending</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD = Movement</p>\n<p>LMB = Interact</p>\n<p>LShift = Sprint</p>\n<p><em>*Other controls will be shown in-game*</em></p>\r\nA Game Made by:\r\n<p><strong>Lachlan Shelton (Omogonix)\u00a0- Programming, Design, Story, Art</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Salih Ikiz (SalihGameplay)</strong>\u00a0<strong>- Terrains</strong></p>\r\nOther Credits:\r\n<p><strong>Alyssa Donchi (Sound Demon)</strong><strong> - Logo</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ian Steel - Bunny Model</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) - Royalty Free Music Used in Game</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dalle-E AI Image Generator - Textures (I was curious how a game made mostly in AI-generated textures would look, so I experimented with this.)</strong></p>\n<p><em>If you have any issues or if you enjoy, be sure to leave a comment. &lt;3</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T09:37:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb7/cb7d5fa7af5c31266989040733569c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lachlan Shelton"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
