Tough luck, champ! <strong>Welcome to Bn\u2019B\u2122!</strong> <br/><br/>It\u2019s a visual novel, but not exactly a visual novel. It\u2019s also an RPG, but not really? It certainly is \u2728something\u2728. <br/><br/><br/><br/>What do you think you\u2019re doing? Attempting a move without consulting with the BM\u2122 first? Thinking you\u2019re gonna rip a goblin\u2019s head off with your bare hands? Roll the dice, kid. Would you look at that, turns out the goblin\u2019s a buff lil fella, you better run for your life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your parents never asked you if you wanted to be born, but since you\u2019re here, you can finally take part in important decision making! Your opinion may come in handy during oddly specific, scripted, fictional scenarios where you\u2019ll be asked to resolve conflict. For instance, do you think the party should talk to a random massive tree or would you be better off committing arson?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This campaign might be short, but you can still form long-lasting relationships (with fictional AI-controlled players that do not exist outside your computer, which sounds weirdly similar to your partner). Side with Elana and cast protection spells together (this is your Sabrina moment) or take Galskap\u2019s side and set the whole world ablaze (this is your Pyro moment).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaltrion\u2122 is like that place you never went to for your annual family vacation- AKA Nashville (good for you, though, it\u2019s literally in the top 10 worst places for family vacation, look it up). Wait, I mean it\u2019s a great place to visit with a Bn\u2019B\u2122 party, just not with your parents, maybe it\u2019s too NSFW for them, unless you got cool parents, which you don\u2019t cause why are you considering playing Bn\u2019B\u2122, then? Explore the myriads of filthy swamps, the thousands of crystal clear lakes, the hundreds of picturesque hills and one cave.<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2236860/Basements_n_Basilisks/<br/><br/><br/>Let me set some things straight first, kiddo. This party has been active in Basementeering\u2122 since 2017. Since then we\u2019ve played like, what, 3 campaigns? We were busy, alright? And, most importantly, the BM\u2122\u2019s job is very demanding. My campaigns are top-notch, the best, chef\u2019s kiss! I would say they\u2019re worth all their... erhm... whatever this costs in your local currency right now (for legal reasons we cannot disclose specific amounts). Maybe even more, but I consider myself rather humble and I don\u2019t wanna get greedy, it\u2019s your first time playing with the party.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T04:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42e/42e3ab761478c9321b228cf6e5999431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["eNVy softworks"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["eNVy softworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
