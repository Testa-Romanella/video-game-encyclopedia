After so long, you just sit immobile in the same spot, relatively unaware of your surroundings, and lost in your own thoughts.</em></p><p><em>Then, one day, you notice something that isn't supposed to happen: your door is open.</em></p><p>Bee Vomit is a side-scrolling, mostly exploration(/puzzle) game, with (some) combat. It's meant to have some horror elements while not being strictly horror, though that may not be apparent in the first (and currently only) level.</p><p>There is pretty much PLACEHOLDER EVERYTHING, so please keep that in mind. Other than that, there should be no problems playing it to completion. Currently, there is only a Windows version.</p><p>A Tumblr for future developments/updates on this is available here: http://beevomit-game.tumblr.com/</p><p>Plugins by:</p><ul><li>Galv</li><li>Yanfly</li><li>MutationIndustries/MuteDay</li><li>Yoji Ojima</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/261/26197c76a1c4d95c978e3e9241087499.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mink"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
