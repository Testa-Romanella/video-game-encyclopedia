With crowds of NPC chickens for you to blend in, survive from dangerous player chickens or kill them first to become the last victor.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHide &amp; Chick is a unique multiplayer hide-and-seek game. It offers a symmetrical hide-and-seek gameplay experience where everyone is a hider and seeker during the entire span of the gameplay time. Every chicken, bots and human players alike, looks the same so walking and talking like one is critical all the while keeping your eyes out for that one dumb chicken to fail blending in. Try your luck in different game modes such as death match, king of the hill and capture the flag and enjoy differently themed maps such as Western film, Medieval Castle and Japanese garden.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T05:59:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/124/124c10a1d604aa7cdfa68acc8d765062.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jisung Choi"], "genres": ["Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jisung Choi"], "esrb_rating": null}
