Humans are vastly outnumbered by robots, both on earth and throughout the galaxy. Initially, these robots were friendly and helpful to humans, but as they evolved, darker strains of robots gradually took hold. These evil androids began rounding up the friendly robots and shipping them off to a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy; Exoplanet B612. <br/><br/>Among the dwindling population of humans, a small group of engineers has devised a plan to reprogram the evil androids and retake control of their fate, but first they need help. That\u2019s why the first step in their plan is to send one of their finest hackers to B612, to resurrect the good bots and bring them back to earth. Everything is riding on this mission; the future of the human race is at stake. <br/><br/>Created in partnership with Tzumi, Robot Resurrection is a fast-paced shooting gallery game that will get your blood pumping.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae0c322f0103ab257c22041d82606ee2.jpg", "website": "http://genievrgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Genie Quest"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Genie Quest"], "esrb_rating": null}
