You live in a post apocalyptic world where desolation is common. You have an ability that no one else does, lucid creativity. In a world where there is no love, no friendship, no heroes, you escape to your own world. You are the hero of the Wilderness. You possess the power to bring happiness to the world. You will save not only the Wilderness of your mind, but the hardships and terror of the \"real\" world.  Destroy your fears that were thrust upon you from the life you are forced to live in. Change, grow, and be the hero both dimensions have been in need for. You are the hero,<br/>\r\n\tYou have the power,<br/>\r\n\tYou will change everything. </p><p>\r\n\t We currently have two game modes, \"Journey\" is the main story line and \"REM Sleep\" is a free roam. In \"REM Sleep\" you start with all items and look for the portals that take you to other maps.</p><p>\r\n\tInspired by the brilliance of Markus Persson's Prelude of the Chambered, Mind Escape sets out to capture the player's imagination. Mind Escape is still in Beta, but we hope you enjoy the game. Mind Escape is $2 USD and comes with free updates. We love to hear feedback/ideas to implement into the game! And remember, the best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8b801ce48cfcd61d6e1dd7ffac6edc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Spera Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
