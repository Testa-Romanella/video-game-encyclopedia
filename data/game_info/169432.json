The game was made in a one month period for the Tyranobuilder Game Jam and is approximately 30 minutes long. Also the first project ever done in Tyrano so things can be pretty basic, but enjoy!!<br/><br/>Diana is a NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) with no luck in job hunting for years; her drive to continue living on is to live a life of laziness and free of labor. Izael is the owner of the local town's general store, housing a wide variety of things for all types of people, alas, if only he could deal with even one type of person without letting his anxiety and overly honest tongue slip out on any who interact with him. Hunter is a hobo, not the bum sort, but a man who will take on any task for coin. Tasked with ending a chain of hand deliveries from who knows where, he sets off to deliver a box to the last person in the chain: Diana.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6f/d6f44971d6c1a6e441c3ef59b7b8c609.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HiroXHeartless"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
