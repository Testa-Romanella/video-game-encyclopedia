(HINT: Press Escape) Normally, this game would be called \"Stupid and full of bugs and glitches that let you bypass everything,\" but this game is made that way for a reason! Use Stickyman's... unique... properties to your advantage and stick to walls, awkwardly jump up on platforms that you should not be able to get up onto, and other weird physics. Each level is possible, but they can be tough to figure out. Keep an open mind and try to do things that normally are not possible in conventional video games.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:34:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/185f4ea865fe9947f415fa43a638dde7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheMostOGName"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
