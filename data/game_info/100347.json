That is just a dream. We hope to make that a reality with ZENITH'S CALL. With writing at the forefront of design, we plan our game mechanics and features with those elements already in place.

Something to keep you immersed and enriched as you play.<br/><br/><br/>If you wish to be part of our community you can join our Discord, favorite our official website or even follow us on Twitter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31bc42a33075a2d7413467e9aa2ab64e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zenithscall"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
