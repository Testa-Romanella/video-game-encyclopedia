But what about the 29th? Well I don't want to bore you with the details but \u00a0to make a long story short, this game was created to celebrate my 29th birthday.</p><p>Why? Because every year, it felt as though my friends and family were celebrating my birthday for me but I wasn't doing so. Therefore, I decided to do something special for myself this year.\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong><p>Left/Right - Directional Keys</p><p>Jump - Z</p><p>Attack - X</p><strong>Install Instructions</strong><p><strong>Windows</strong>: Unzip, run the .exe file and enjoy!</p><p><strong>Mac</strong>:\u00a0If you have blocked unsigned apps you will see a warning when you try to open the game.
