Go from sober to somber in an empty barcade and pass the time with any of the three haunted arcade games.

Don't give up, but don't get confident.\u00a0\r\nDARK DECK - A dungeon themed twist on solitaire, take on the 20 deadly monsters in the depths. Take up your sword and shield and face the cowardly beasts as they attack and retreat.\r\n</p>\n<p>For those brave souls who search their dream for the strength to succeed; secret wonders await you\u00a0in the physical world.</p>\n<p>Note: if you want to play in a larger resolution, download the Windows installer!</p><p>Check out the Patreon for this new and ongoing project!</p><p>-- Aspect MGMT</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:43:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa8/fa80be22646a9b982ef376d5be180ea0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AspectManufacture"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
