Light", "description": "<p>Ascend, collect fire and beware the Goopers in this upwards platformer about the\u00a0 experiments of Fundamental Radioactive Advancements and Insight Laboratories or F.R.A.I.L. for short.</p>\n<p>F.R.A.I.L. has found a way to escape the limitations of the human body and become a \"Light\", a more agile and complete being, however with this method comes the danger of turning into a \"Gooper\" instead, a sluggish, hive mind creature, unable to think or function outside of attempting to assimilate another living being.</p>\n<p>The chances of a successful transformation is very low and, as such, the Goopers have rapidly grown in number and taken over the whole building. This is where the Lights come in, they've been sent in to retrieve objects from the facility, some by F.R.A.I.L., some by other agencies</p>\n<p>This game has 6 playable characters:</p>\n<p>-Light1-once a teenage boy, now a superior being tasked with retrieving items from an abandoned facility\u00a0(the standard, simple experience)</p>\n<p>-Light2-a girl once blind, now able to see, but something is off about her vision still (randomized visual overlays)</p>\n<p>-Light3-a secret agent tasked with spying on F.R.A.I.L. activity, after being caught and forced into the transformation, with the intent to turn him into a blank headed Gooper, he's come out as a Light and managed to escape (has to watch out for functioning cameras and can set up smoke machines to create blind spots\u00a0the cameras can't reach)</p>\n<p>Light4-a middle-aged woman once allergic to water, now entirely comprised of it, she is considered a Light based on her agility\u00a0even though she is a middle ground between Lights and Goopers based on her physical makeup (has to constantly collect water pick ups to stay alive)</p>\n<p>Gooper1-a middle-aged man who has volunteered alongside his wife and daughter for this program, although the transformation was not successful he's maintained past memories as well as not constantly seeking to assimilate things (can't jump and has to be lifted up by the pile of Goopers, will lose if squashed into the pile by hitting a ceiling and has to watch out for falling Goopers which deduct a point from the pick up counter)</p>\n<p>The game has day and night variations for each character as well as the history of how I got into making\u00a0games</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:44:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/122/1227c249b09673f4f330ba1169562d2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Waterleaf"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
