Cities are becoming plus\u00a0and plus\u00a0populated than ever and living spaces have tightened as a result with people now situated in apartments scattered across the city. It has also become much busier as the density of the population has resulted in a louder, overloaded atmosphere. Therefore,\u00a0 many citizens have been taking measures in order to ensure that their homes are insulated and sound-proofed from the world outside their windows.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>The person that is currently staying in this apartment has been affected by her living situation\u00a0</em><em>and has turned to music to combat the noise as best as possible. Whilst living by herself at the moment, she is\u00a0 constantly juggling a few jobs in order to pay rent for the place as it is just what she can afford to live in without having to resort to finding an alternative place. Because she is always working, she is rarely at home and so the apartment always appears deserted to passersby. However, she did her very best to set up her home as a space she can come back to and rest after\u00a0long hours at work.</em></p>\n<p>H O W\u00a0 T O\u00a0 P L A Y:<br/></p>\n<p>W A S D to move around<br/>Space to jump<br/>P on keyboard\u00a0or left click on the radio to pause music<br/>R or right click on the radio to resume music<br/>ESC to pause game &amp; access options and exit</p>\n<p>C R E D I T S:</p>\n<p>audiokinetic code for pause and resume music adapted from<br/>https://www.audiokinetic.com/qa/2448/how-to-pause-all-sound-with-unity-scripts</p>\n<p>First Person Drifter by Ben Esposito<br/>http://www.torahhorse.com/index.php/portfolio/first-person-drifter-for-unity/</p>\n<p>Apartment Building Modular Pack by MRowa<br/>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/apartment-houses-modular-pack-65c7126c32384ab8a8...</p>\n<p>Urban Night\u00a0Sky skybox by Kendall Weaver<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/urban-night-sky-...</p>\n<p>Music Credit: LAKEY INSPIRED<br/>Track Names: \"Blue Boi\", \"Going Up\", \"I Found Me\", \"One My Way\", \"Warm Nights\"<br/>Music By: LAKEY INSPIRED<br/>https://www.chilloutmedia.com/lakey-inspired</p>\n<p>Official SoundCloud\u00a0 https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired<br/>Official YouTube Channel:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmy8wuTpC95lefU5d1dt2Q</p>\n<p>License for commercial use: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported \"Share Alike\" (CC BY-SA 3.0)\u00a0<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode<br/>Music promoted by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ</p>\n<p>www.ChillOutMedia.com / www.LoFi-HipHop.com</p>\n<p>N O T E S:</p>\n<p>Still a work on progress so feel free to point out any bugs or issues you come across.</p>\n<p>At the moment there are only five songs available listen\u00a0to and they play in a random order every time you open the game. They do not loop continuously nor is there a way to skip through the songs. However, that is something I hope to implement in the future so that you will be able to not only have more song options but it will also display on the UI what is playing currently.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:00:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f38f6296b57e2637b34c0045e407e11a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ashtyn B"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
