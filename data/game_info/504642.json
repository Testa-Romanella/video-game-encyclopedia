To overcome them and fulfill your CONTRACT, you must use your PHANTOM POWER to reverse time and slay your targets. If you get caught, this power allows you to reset and try again. This power comes with a CURSE - you must repeat this moment in time until the mission is COMPLETE.</p>\n<p>Once all of the ONI have been slain, you are free to move to your next mission. How quickly can you dispatch all of your foes, and rejoice as you watch your PHANTOM CLONES thin the ranks of your opponents.</p>\n<p>RONIN was made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 47 for the theme STUCK IN A LOOP.
