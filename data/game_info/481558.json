Built over the course of 15+ years, it was intended to act as the \"face\" of the engine, and to showcase as much as possible of what it could do. Featuring original graphics (by Fenrir-Lunaris) and an original soundtrack (by Artimus Bena), Vikings pays homage to the classic role playing games of the 1990's.</p>\n<ul><li>An expansive world to explore that changes with the player's actions!</li><li>A host of horrible fiends and terrible monsters to fight!</li><li>10 playable heroes - each with their own unique strengths!</li><li>Can't stand random encounters?
