If a player has less than 3 of a number and the opponent continues scoring on that number, the point total is automatically calculated.<br/><br/>To score 501 or 301, switch to the first player to score by using the 'Switch Player' button (their score is shown in yellow).  Then enter each scoring dart, such as 'T20' for a Triple 20.  The point total will automatically be deducted, and when 3 entries are made, it switches to the next player automatically.<br/><br/>You can undo as many moves as needed, if you make a mistake.<br/><br/>If the remaining score for either player has a 2 or 3 dart 'Out', it is shown under that player's score.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T02:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/963/963e6cb780a0173731e4211633dde693.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Trevor Foltz"], "genres": ["Sports", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Trevor Foltz"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
