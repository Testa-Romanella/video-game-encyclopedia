Your special ability? You can control weapons... with your mind! Aiding on\u00a0your mission to bring the world to it's knees is your power to JOIN TOGETHER and become one with the gun (or as you will soon see... be one with dozens of firearms\u00a0 at once!)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>WASD or Arrows to move. Left Mouse to Shoot.</p>\n<p>Developed for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam \"Joined Together\".\u00a0 The game follows the theme by when you find a gun it then becomes linked to you. One gun may not seem like a big deal, but eventually you will have dozens of pistols, machine guns, and rocket launchers all joined together in unison under your control. As your arsenal gets bigger the more enemies you can take on at once... which in turn gives you even more guns to control.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Created with Game Maker Studio 2</p>\n<p>Programming/Design by Me</p>\n<p><strong>Graphics:</strong></p>\n<p>Majority of graphics like the tile sets and characters are mostly from Kenney's Top Down Shooter Pack -\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/assets/topdown-shooter</p>\n<p>Weapons are from Jestan -\u00a0https://jestan.itch.io/weapons-pack</p>\n<p>Tank is from Ragewortt -\u00a0https://ragewortt.itch.io/top-down-sci-fi-tanks</p>\n<p><strong>Sound:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>From https://freesound.org/\u00a0- specifically thanks to lemudcrab, marregheriti, superphat, jarusca, highpixel, and tonsil5.</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Linear</strong> Phase by Electronic Senses | https://soundcloud.com/electronicsenses\u00a0<br/><strong>Absolom</strong> by Electronic Senses | https://soundcloud.com/electronicsenses\u00a0<br/><strong>Aura</strong> by Electronic Senses | https://soundcloud.com/electronicsenses<br/>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com<br/>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unportedhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US</p>\n<p><strong>Motion Blur</strong> by Nihilore -\u00a0http://www.nihilore.com/synthwave</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for playing! \"N\" key skips levels btw...</p>\n<p>-SwornCoyote</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:36:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad5/ad5a954620f7f57a12f4c19969011ed6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SwornCoyote"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
