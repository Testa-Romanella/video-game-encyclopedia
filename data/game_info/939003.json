If you're here, that means you're interested in seeing my work :) Thanks!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I decided to challenge myself and learn C# with the GameDev.tv Unity Game Developer course on Udemy.com. What you're about to play is 2 full days (about 30-ish hours) of hard, non-stop work. Right now there are 8 levels. Some are easy, but they gradually become more difficult. This is still a blockout, 3D models will come later.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How do I move?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-&gt;</strong> Use the A and D keys to rotate left or right.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>-&gt; </strong>Press your spacebar to boost!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>-&gt; </strong>ESC to stop/reload (pressing ESC doesn't pause the game (yet!)) I'm also asking for feedback. Are some levels too dark? Are the levels too hard? Too easy? If so, what made it hard/easy? What level stood out to you the most, and for good or bad?\u00a0Everything related to your experience with the gameplay is welcome.\u00a0</p><p>There is no end screen yet; completing the last level brings you back to level 1!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T15:05:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/3260e7ddfa7b9bbf99ac5d49cb0974d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ClydeXYZ"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
