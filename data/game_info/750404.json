Murder.</p>\n<p>&quot;Who is the murderer? Some never find out, if he is cunning enough to elude them for long enough. He is normal just like the rest of us, if not a little bit too normal. He is you, and he is me. He is inside the walls, and he is waiting.</p>\n<p>Even more interesting is this: If the &quot;murderer&quot; simply blends in and waits, keeping his knife hidden and watching as the innocents off each other one by one, is he still the monster? Sometimes the &quot;innocents&quot; kill more than the &quot;murderer&quot; does. So who is sane?</p>\n<p>Don&#39;t think about it too long, or you&#39;ll become distracted enough for him (or me, or that other guy) to sneak up behind you. Good luck.&quot; -WhiteRabbit on &quot;WhoDunIt&quot;</p>\n<p>WhoDunIt is a custom gamemode for Zandronum that rewards the observant, and punishes the clumsy.</p>\n<p>The game starts with all the players spawning in various locales, armed with little but their fists and an array of melee weapons scattered around the levels. After a short while, one player is chosen as the Murderer. The Murderer&#39;s goal is simple: Murder everyone. His preferred method to deliver death? A sliver of metal between the vertebrae.</p>\n<p>The Murderer has to be cautious, though! For while the knife is the most efficient and satisfying method of taking out others, drawing it is very loud and visually obvious; Marking him as the largest threat in the room, usually ending with him in a corner getting his skull bashed in by &#39;The Innocents&#39;.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, all these deaths have left the Murderer with a constantly draining sanity, eventually losing it and committing suicide when unable to watch something squirm and die.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the trademarked knife he carries isn&#39;t the only weapon at his disposal; Poisonous chlorine gas, remote cameras, smoke bombs, poisoned first-aid kits, and even Automated trip-wire shotguns allow The Murderer to manipulate and destroy his prey.</p>\n<p>But what happens when The Murderer blends in a little too well? What happens if somebody loses it and kills someone completely innocent? Two mistakes. That&#39;s all you get before you are removed from the game instantly. After an Innocent kills one Innocent, he is marked with a Yellow Aura, enabling other players to beat him to within an inch of his life before being allowed to venture with the others. Another mistake? You won&#39;t be heard from again...</p>\n<p>Worse still, The Murderer has a penchant for being able to find the careless, regardless of their location.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T14:37:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a36/a3680a045cd128b9f4864a65ea5b0ff4.jpg", "website": "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/v-z/whodunit", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
