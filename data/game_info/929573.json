As a part of the <strong>Brackeys 2023.1 Game Jam</strong>. The theme for this competition was <em>\"An End Is a New Beginning.\"</em></p>\n<p>In this game, you play as an engineer trying to help the surviving population rebuild their homes in a post-apocalyptic future. Each level presents a new challenge and puzzle to be solved, and you must carefully plan and execute the demolition of old buildings to make way for new construction to take their place.</p>\n<p>The game is the perfect mix for city-building and puzzle game fans with its retro-inspired graphics and challenging gameplay. So why not try it and see if you can help rebuild a brighter future for the citizens of this post-apocalyptic world by solving some puzzles? Good luck, and have fun!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>By Linus Vallinder\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T11:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59a9c45a9b30c243bd4083702593cc23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Globox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
