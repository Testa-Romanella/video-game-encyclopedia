I made a\u00a0 Deck Building Card Game (like Ascension, Star Realms\u00a0or Dominion) but unlike the games of this genre I took out the ability to automatically reshuffle your discard into the deck when it runs out, making the objective of the game to find ways to shuffle back some cards before running out and losing.</p>\n<p>Also the Center row does not automatically provides Cards for you to buy, instead you must pay a resource in order to reveal more Cards.</p>\n<p>I ran out of time so no sounds,</p>\n<p>Also no card art.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing!</p>\n<p>I'd be very curious to know how many turns you manage to survive, so please let me know!</p>\n\n<p>Links to things I used:</p>\n<p>Ui Elements<br/>https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack</p>\n<p>Background<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/painted-hq-2d-forest-medie...</p>\n<p>I also used DOTween</p>\n<p>http://dotween.demigiant.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/390791361fbbba59c66d0760ed785fc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Filippy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
