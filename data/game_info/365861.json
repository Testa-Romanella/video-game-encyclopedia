Load into a stage from the star map, blast waves of enemies for awesome power-ups and clear your objectives to unlock the next stage. Clear every stage and find out what's waiting in the final stage...hmmmm I wonder what it could be.</p>\n\n<p>We are planning on adding more stages, more power-ups, more enemies, progression and more. Please tell us what you think and share your ideas with us either in the discussion board below, in our\u00a0Discord Server or on Twitter\u00a0@MisfitLabsDev. Or you can follow our blog posts on our website.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b99/b991473bc496cc846fc662f8a44a09e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Misfit Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
