You start with an empty world and an exit door, but it's not so simple. You reveal the path by shooting magic and gathering the shards to make a complete picture.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game is suitable for all ages and has <strong>English and Russian</strong> language support. 20 levels form a gameplay with duration for an hour (or even more!). All levels can be replayed in either order if unlocked.</p><p>Presskit<br/></p>Linux version<p>After a week of fighting with engine I made it! *hooray* Test it, send to your friends and please tell me if something bad happens.
