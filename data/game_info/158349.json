I originally wanted to make an smt-style dungeon crawler where instead of demons, you can befriend slimes. It then got dialed back as a rogue-like game, then dialed back more into a vn with some real time elements (slimes randomly visit you and you continue down their route that way) and finally it turned into a very short game where you get 2 slimes coming to the door giving (hopefully) you some (hopefully) good advice.</p>\n<p>The code is an absolute MESS, and i hope to one day use a proper editor and clean it up if only so i can learn how to clean messy code.</p>\n<p>Despite the game being nowhere near what I wanted it to be, I managed to have fun with it, and that's all that matters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49c/49c6015289bfbf6f132bcc3f53fc3bc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wych(witch)"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
