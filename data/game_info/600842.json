All the images are programmed using\u00a0Python and Pygame.\u00a0 You play as a frog and your enemy is a snake which constantly attacks you. There is also a cannon which shoots venom-lumps at you which reduces your health.\u00a0You need to save yourself by jumping between platforms, while at the same time eat the small circular bees in order to increase your power.\u00a0When you have full power you can radiate some of the energy to reduce the snake's health. Once you have completely defeated your enemy in this way, you have cleared the level!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T12:46:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/513/513a218777293ad5c3fd2d444bbcdc69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tank king"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
