Each level uses a different level design to make the player think differently. Level 9 &amp; 18 are special boss levels. </p><p><strong>Spinning Mechanic</strong></p><p>Whenever you click or tap, your ship will thrust in the direction its facing, if you're not thrusting the ship will return to spinning.</p><p><strong>Player Customization</strong></p><p>The player can customize the colour of the ship as well as the thruster colours. Customization is accessed through the main menu. </p><p><strong>Boss Fights!</strong></p><p>Every ninth level there is a boss fight. The bosses use a tricky AI based around the players spin mechanic. The boss levels are really fun and challenging.</p><p><strong>Gravity Fields</strong></p><p>In later levels, the level design incorporates gravity fields. Gravity fields suck the player in and cause nearby asteroids to orbit and spin around the gravity field. This completely changes how the game is played but adds a fun dynamic to the game. </p><p>This game was made by John Dunning (Twitter @JC_Dunning)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b42/b42c5b4216b74b368a2b2d50140aa1ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["John.Dunning"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
