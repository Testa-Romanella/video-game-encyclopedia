There are no brakes and your train is stuck on accelerate, so it just gets faster and faster. <br/>You can collect missiles and use them to collect triangles or blow up the GhostTrains. <br/>There isn't any time limit or score. All you have to do is collect ALL of the triangles . <br/>The first few levels are not so hard, but as you progress to the upper levels, you will find it more and more challenging to play with SuperSpeed2D free! <br/>Easy to learn, difficult to master!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:36:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b40/b40eaf8e2e9368a4856e1d4c38f3e5dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kathrin Brock"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Family"], "publishers": ["Kathrin Brock"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
