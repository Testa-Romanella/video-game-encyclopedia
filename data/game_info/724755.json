Nothing is further from reality, every day you get up and prepare for battle. When the time comes, the school bell will ring and you will go out to the playground...  You've worked too hard tidying up your room to have money for gum, and now you want your reward. But you are not a novice, and you know that those who call themselves partners, the moment you have your gums, they will become scavenger creatures that will not hesitate to snatch gums from you until you have none left.  Explore the playground to create the best \u201cin and out\u201d strategy that will allow you to get to class with as many gumballs as possible before recess is over. Use gum as a distraction to avoid further losses. If you run out of gum you can always go back to the kiosk to buy another pack.\r\n Gameplay(Spanish):  https://youtu.be/pqdh4A-Wx-8", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:07:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/086/086228281a97e63bc7922e398cda1d07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DinoWalrus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
