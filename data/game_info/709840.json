There are also 8 ready made characters for you to use in your own TTRPG games, stories, or cosplays. The rest of the creation pack can be used to further personalize them. The prompts and tables are setting neutral, so you can use them with any setting, though not every detail will fit every situation. My supplement Build a Witch would also be applicable to many druids, and has a completely different set of prompts.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0would love to hear about the druids you create!
