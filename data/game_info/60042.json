In short, there's reading involved, not a lot, but if you don't like reading a few sentences of text, this might not be the game for you. If in doubt, we recommend that you watch a few gameplay videos and see if we can lure you to the dark side with one of our knee-slappers!<br/><br/>The game is also short, so expect a game to take about 15 minutes if you're playing on your own or about 30 minutes if you are playing with friends\u2026 or enemies. We are fully committed to bring out more stories, Ancient Ones to summon, items and modes, but it is expected that you will rush through these quicker than we can generate content. To help with content fatigue, we encourage players to make use of our Steam Workshop feature to create their own stories and share them with the community, so that we all can enjoy new, fun and silly encounters. If you are interested in creating your own stories, you can check out more information on our Content Creator, on our forum page.<br/><br/>We want your experience with Fhtagn! to be as enjoyable as possible, so please do not hesitate to provide us with any feedback. If you want to just chat, report some bugs or if you find anything misleading on our store page, we'd like to hear from you on our social media or here on the forums.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read about our game and we hope you will enjoy playing it (seriously if you could read this you'll cruise through the in-game text). <br/><br/>Gameplay<ul><li>You are a cultist intent on destroying the universe by summoning the Ancient One.

We currently don\u2019t have the resources to produce the game in other languages, in a way that is authentic and will do the stories and humor in it justice. However, we encourage players to create content in any languages they want and spread the madness that is Fhtagn! We will happily support any UI language localization changes should there be sufficient need.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc3/bc3ef9c0287ab2ff9c3721a31960e32c.jpg", "website": "https://designimps.com/fhtagn", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 15, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 43, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 404, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Design Imps"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Design Imps"], "esrb_rating": null}
