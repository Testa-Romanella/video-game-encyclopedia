This game was developed back in 2017 as a fathers' day gift by my brother and I. Back then we had just started developing games and I remember being particularly happy with this one. I mean, the theme was perfect since my father is a huuuge Guardians of the Galaxy fan and the second movie is pretty much all about father figures and stuff. The reason to why I never published is because I was always kinda scared of the whole copyrights stuff but I figured it wouldn't be a problem(I hope at least) as long as we made it clear that the game was just something we were doing for fun and nothing else. After literally 3 years I finally decided to publish it. It's really rough around the edges and the menu looks like complete crap, but it is quite fun if I do say so myself. Not bad for newbies :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/057/05767491f598b2c3bbf9992dd43cbee4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mateus Ikezaki"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
