You jump all over the screen while shooting each other.</p>\n<p>The controls are simple: One player uses W, A, S, and space to move around and shoot while the other uses the arrow keys and control. Only a keyboard and no controllers are needed.</p>\n<p>You decide how long a game takes by selecting how much health each player has. If you are a pro and play against a player who is less familliar with gaming you can simply set the other players' health to be a lot higher than yours so it's still a fun and challenging experience for both players!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T03:48:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2f00be1542bb293172c02b8eaa119e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AsfiGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
