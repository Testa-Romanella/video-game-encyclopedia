You get points for each note played that is<em> on-scale</em> and lose points when you play notes <em>out-of-scale</em>.</p>\n<p><em>On-scale:</em><br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Out-of-scale:<br/></em></p>\n\n<p>Play the correct notes <em>on-scale</em> over a whole string, or make a bridge of notes from the first string to the last and you'll clear those pieces. Whenever you clear lines or rows you get points, which are multiplied by your current note placing streak.</p>\n<p><em>Clearing rows:<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><em><em>Clearing lines:<br/></em></em></p>\n\n<p>With the metronome you have to play at least one note each measure unless you want to lose the game. If you miss a measure you lose one strike, but you get one back for each line or row you clear.<br/><br/>You can practice on a guitar or bass, from 4 to 8 strings and from 12 to 24 frets,\u00a0right-handed or left-handed, using any scale with any root note, you can have a visual hint of the scale or practice without hints for added difficulty.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b00/b003929df67a78db9fd02d6e006e2965.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Killerkun"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
