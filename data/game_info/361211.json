A platform that will assist you on this journey as high as possible.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Mouse - character movement<br/>WASD - platform movement<br/>LMB - stop character's jump early<br/>RMB - shrink and slow down the platform</p>\n<p>Meteors will kill you and destroy the platform, gas clouds will kill you but won't affect the platform and coins grant bonus points.</p>\n<p>This was designed to be a singleplayer game, but it can be played with one player controlling the character and second one moving the platform.</p>\n<p>This isn't the game that I originally wanted to make. But halfway through the first day I learned that I won't be able to do much during the second day. That left me with a started project that I wouldn't be able to finish. So I threw it onto an ever-growing pile of unfinished games and made this.</p>\n<p>My devlog documenting the creation of this game: (Link will be added soon)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50a/50a3371b3614afd033e9f796ad9238ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Erukolindo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
