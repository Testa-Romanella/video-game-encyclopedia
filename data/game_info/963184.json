This hero is recommended for more experienced players since he can be very fragile. He can be played as support hero, as a damage dealer or hybrid of both.\n<br/>\nFarseer\t        The Farseer is mainly a support hero that relies on her capabilities to cast protective buffs as well as hide her allies or teleport them away from danger. The main abilities of the Farseer are Confuse and Veil of Tears which causes enemies to attack each other. The Farseer is also capable of cloaking and teleporting friendly units.\n<br/>\nMekboy\t The Mekboy is a ranged teleporting damage dealer. This hero is easy to start with as the required equipment becomes available early in the progression system. He can also be used as a suicide bomber that unleashes devastating amounts of damage.\n<br/>\nCaptain\t The Captain is an all-round hero that is good in ranged and melee combat, while various abilities are mainly focused on melee combat. This hero is able to call-down the might Dreadnought to support him and his allies against the enemy invaders.\n<br/>\nLord General\t The Lord General is a defensive specialist who is capable of deploying different types of buildings and infantry squads to assist him and the team. Equipped with these abilities this hero allows the player to explore many different strategies that lead to victory.\n<br/>\nHive Tyrant\t The Hive Tyrant is a slow but hero that cannot be suppressed or knocked down. \n<br/>\nThis hero\u2019s strength lie within his brutal melee weapons that will slice enemies apart and his ability to summon units of Tyranids to the battlefield make him a powerful addition to any team.\n<br/>\n<h3>DLCs included:</h3>\n\nThe Last Stand Tau Commander<br/>\nThe Tau Commander is a new hero for\u00a0Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution\u2122\u00a0and\u00a0Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: The Last Stand Alone\u2122. The Tau Commander comes with 26 pieces of wargear, 2 achievements, an all new voice and 20 levels of progression. The Tau Commander is an offensively potent hero who can only fire at range and is vulnerable in melee. He can summon one of up to three drones to support his efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\nChaos Sorcerer Wargear<br/>\nRevamp your heroes and find new ways to play and compete in The Last Stand with these new Wargear pieces.<br/>\nRubric Touched Helm (Accessory)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis accessory has a single trait assigned to it called Dark Fortification. When the Sorcerer is struck in melee he gains 150 armor rating for 10 seconds. As long as he moves from melee combat to melee combat he will be extremely resistant to both melee and ranged damage.<br/>\nOracle Stave (Two handed weapon)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis bad boy is one of my favourites. Its damage output isn\u2019t particularly fantastic but it has a chance to trigger a trait called Fate Weaver. Fate Weaver charges up the weapon to ridiculous proportions causing the Sorcerer\u2019s next melee attack to do incredible single target damage, and significant area of effect damage around the attack. This way you can engage chaff and get your armor and damage up, move over to a high priority target and unleash the pain.\n\n<br/><br/>\nDeath Korps of Krieg Skin Pack<br/>\nThe Imperial Guard Death Korps of Krieg Regiment Pack adds the iconic Imperial Guard regiment to Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution\u2122 with ten unique models for the major multiplayer units as well as the Death Korps of Krieg distinctive color patterns. The Lord General is updated with the distinctive Death Korps gas mask and uniform his regiment also now sports the uniform and look of the Death Korps. The Commissar Lord also wears the Death Korps gas mask and his Commissar brethren have also taken their rightful places atop the turrets of the Chimeras and Leman Russ tanks of the Death Korps, sporting new animations as they command the forces of the Imperium into battle. The Inquisitor has donned a unique skull faced gas mask. The Imperial Guardsmen all sport the distinctive gas masks, uniforms and lasrifles of the Death Korps including the Sergeants and Heavy Weapons teams. The Leman Russ has been updated to bear the mighty Executioner Cannon as well as its new Commissar and the Ogryns have been updated with gas masks as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFarseer Wargear<br/>\nRevamp your heroes and find new ways to play and compete in The Last Stand with these new Wargear pieces.<br/>\nDebilitating Witchblade (One handed weapon)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis witchblade is meant to be a tank weapon, if you are familiar with MMORPG terms. If you aren\u2019t, that means she can go toe to toe with the biggest creatures in Last Stand using this sword, but you trade off damage. The sword has two traits: Sap and Energy Leach. Sap reduces the melee damage of anything hit in melee by 50% for 5 seconds. Energy Leach will increase the Farseer\u2019s energy every time she kills something in melee.<br/>\nIdranel\u2019s Armor (Armor)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis armor is named after the infamous Farseer from the Dawn of War II campaign. It is another piece designed to improve the Farseer\u2019s chances in melee and her durability in general. It will increase her total health and give her the traits Unshakable and Foresight. Foresight reduces incoming melee damage. If only Idranel could have seen that uppercut coming from Tarkus.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHive Tyrant Wargear<br/>\nRevamp your heroes and find new ways to play and compete in The Last Stand with these new Wargear pieces.<br/>\nThornback Carapace (Armor)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to be confused with Thornback, the Thornback Carapace is a very durable armor piece that is covered in blades. Every time an enemy attacks the Hive Tyrant in melee they take damage.<br/>\nDevourer Cannon<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Devourer Cannon is a unique ranged weapon. It fires a parasite at the enemy which will cause damage over time to their entire squad. To maximize the effect, the Tyranid player should try to attack multiple squads in order to inflict the most amount of damage.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLord General Wargear<br/>\nRevamp your heroes and find new ways to play and compete in The Last Stand with these new Wargear pieces.<br/>\nUrsidae Trophy (Accessory)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis inspiring mantle grants two traits. The first is Inspired Will which increases the health of all of the General\u2019s infantry. The second is Superior Provisions which drastically increases the health of the General\u2019s turrets. Pretty simple but effective and it looks badass.<br/>\nOrnate Vostroyan Shotgun (Two handed weapon)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo of course if we give the General a bear pelt we have to give him the gun he used to shoot said bear. This shotgun allows the general to carve through mobs of infantry with its AOE attack a little easier than some of his other weapons. It also comes with a Solid Slug ability which will do high single target damage for those pesky Wraithlords and Warbosses.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMekboy Wargear<br/>\nRevamp your heroes and find new ways to play and compete in The Last Stand with these new Wargear pieces.<br/>\nJuiced Up Tellyporta (Accessory)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Orky teleporter add-on causes a bit of added destruction. It grants a trait called Ported!! What Ported!! does is cause anything teleported by the Mekboy to explode, including himself. This works in conjunction with the Zzap Knife, the Teleporta Pack and the Mad Teleporta Pack.<br/>\nPokkit Rokkit Launcha (One handed weapon)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pokkit Rokkit Launcha is a much cuter version of the Rokkit Launcha. It is one handed and counts as a pistol. Because it only fire one rocket, it isn\u2019t nearly as powerful as the two handed version but it does provide some knockback for a melee oriented Mek\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTyranid Race Pack<br/>\nIncludes 4 unique ability and wargear items to equip your squad with.\n<ul>\n<li>VENOMOUS TALONS: Attacks upon the enemy now have a guaranteed chance to stun and poison them for a short duration.</li>\n<li>POISONOUS CYSTS: After taking a fixed amount of melee damage your Swarmlord will now spray a poison cloud that damages your enemies.</li>\n<li>SHADOW IN THE WARP: When hit you now convert some of that damage to energy to power your abilities.</li>\n<li>WARP FIELD: Calls forth an energy shield to protect your character from damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n\nChaos Space Marines Race Pack<br/>\nIncludes 4 unique ability and wargear items to equip your squad with.\n<ul>\n<li>SKULL BREAKER:\u00a0Hits on the enemy with this weapon have the chance to cause an explosive area of effect attack.</li>\n<li>ARMOR OF IMMORTAL:\u00a0Gain the protection of an invulnerability shield when your character is critically injured.</li>\n<li>HERALD OF THE WARP:\u00a0Equipping this item significantly lowers your ability cooldown timers.</li>\n<li>MARK OF CHAOS FAVOR:\u00a0Your character gains the benefits of chaos god worship from all the dark gods.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nEldar Race Pack<br/>\nIncludes 4 unique ability and wargear items to equip your squad with.\n<ul>\n<li>SPEAR OF THE YNNEAD: Attacks upon the enemy can now confuse them and cause them to attack each other.</li>\n<li>GUILE OF CEGORACH: The death of allied units now increases the chance of you entering an enraged state that increases your speed and damage.</li>\n<li>RUNES OF WISDOM: Lowers the energy cost of using abilities.</li>\n<li>HELM OF THE WAR HOST: Your hero gains immunity to knock back and suppression.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nImperial Guard Race Pack<br/>\nIncludes 4 unique ability and wargear items to equip your squad with.\n<ul>\n<li>THE EMPEROR'S EXECUTIONERS: Instantly kill infantry units with less than a fifth of their health remaining.</li>\n<li>BLESSED CARAPACE OF RESOLVE: Friendly units within the area gain increased damage resistance.</li>\n<li>HONORIFICA IMPERIALIS: Friendly units within the area have their ability cooldowns reduced.</li>\n<li>HELM OF THE DISTINGUISHED IMPERIAL OFFICER: Friendly units within the area are healed and have their energy restored when you kill an enemy.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nOrk Race Pack<br/>\nIncludes 4 unique ability and wargear items to equip your squad with.\n<ul>\n<li>KAN OPENER: Your attacks now have a chance to disable enemy vehicles.</li>\n<li>ANGRY ARMOR: Enemy attacks on the Warboss increases the damage he does.</li>\n<li>LUCKY TEEF: When you Warboss kills an enemy, friendly units in the surrounding area gain energy.</li>\n<li>SUPA FLASHY BOSS RACK: Your Warboss now gains the benefits of both a boss pole and a trophy rack.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nUltramarines Pack<br/>\nThe Ultramarines Pack adds the iconic Space Marine chapter to Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution\u2122 with eight unique models for the major multiplayer units as well as new color schemes for the others.

It doesn\u2019t provide any damage but increases the health and armor of the Captain. On top of this it provides a trait called Shield Block that reduces incoming ranged damage.<br/>\nSacred Relic Armor (Armor)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sacred Relic armor has low-to-medium armor rating but provides the Space Marine with a lot more melee offense. After all, the best defense is to just kill your opponent before he attacks you. It grants two traits which are Crushing Blows and Melee Expert. Crushing Blows causes any melee attack from the Space Marine to do area of effect damage, and Melee Expert bumps his melee damage by 15%.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUlthwe Wargear DLC<br/>\nThe Ulthw\u00e9 Pack adds the iconic Eldar craftworld to Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution\u2122 with nine unique models for the major multiplayer units as well as new color schemes for the others.
