Represented here by the cost of the player's life to be able to shoot at his enemy.</p>\n<p>The brick texture was from <strong>DJ Fenix\u00a0</strong>from the website \"<strong>HamsterSpeak\"</strong> from this page : <strong>http://superwalrusland.com/ohr/issue26/</strong> . I created some variant with blood texture to fit in the universe of my game.</p>\n<p>The music from the game are from <strong>TeknoAXE</strong> from his channel here : <strong>Conferring with an old Master</strong> (for the menu) and <strong>Bad Graffix Crow</strong>(for the rest of the game). His website can be found <strong>here</strong>.</p>\n<p>The sound-effect was made with the library of sound effects from the website <strong>FreeSound</strong>.\u00a0 The sounds used are : <strong>Explosion_03</strong>; <strong>Explosion_01</strong>; <strong>Hit_03 </strong>; <strong>Hit_01</strong></p>\n<p>And finally, i used <strong>this</strong> (number 5 of the list) sound from <strong>Universal Soundbank</strong><strong> .<br/></strong></p>\n<p>It was my first Game Jam and i wanted to make a solo project to see what i can do. Ordinary I'm a gameplay programmer so i had to improvise on the art (which are cool btw) and the sound. I'm quite happy with the result but I would like to have your return to what could be improved.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/34462b74fb2544666f695c8d76e5eba5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpartanM23"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
