It'll take time to master! Don't worry, survivors exist to perish. You control your character fully, at all times, based on complex inputs - you will never sit there while an animation plays.<br/><br/>This game's combat will take practice: at first you will find it hard to survive even a minute. To win and master combat you will have to slow down and pay attention, pressing random buttons in a panic will only send your survivor to an even earlier grave. You will learn how to move, how to use momentum to hit HARD, you will make up your own moves and fight in your own style.<br/><h3>An unforgiving, difficult Roguelite experience.</h3>Chronicle Survivors is an Unreal Engine powered gorgeous action roguelike game with short (5-15 minutes), hardcore and meaningful objectives, thoughtful progression, variety of levels, loads of unique mechanic enemies and, of course, grindy epic loot with a continuous development path.<br/><br/>Take control of a survivor with a single life, that you lead to defeat the domain menace!<br/><h3>Each run is totally unique!</h3>There are many roads to becoming victor. The arenas and enemies are ever changing, no two runs are the same!<br/><h3>Strategise your way to victory - combat skills alone are not enough!</h3>Deal with random events, collect powerful loot, unlock new abilities, and unearth hidden secrets as you progress through the game. Your decisions matter, and every choice could mean the difference between survival and succumbing to the ever-present peril.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-25T01:16:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/82671cbf4f724a0f732e49c5abdca8e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 485, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rusalka Unreal Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rusalka Unreal Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
