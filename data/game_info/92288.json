Under pressure of changing her ways, she takes on an assignment very different from what's she's accustomed to. Her new job requires her to look out for a 17-year-old girl while she is in college. What sounded like an easy piece of work \u2013 with the plus of turning over a new leaf \u2013 turns out to be quite the predicament for Inna... in more than one way.<br/><br/><br/><br/><em>This release features 3 complete endings, and 1 ongoing one.</em><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Inna Antonova</strong>:<br/><br/><br/>The protagonist. <br/>Inna generally avoids social interactions, save for the ones with her contacts and clients.
