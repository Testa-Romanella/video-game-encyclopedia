Every 20 or 30 points leads to the next round!</p>(Faster balloons and spiky balloons)<br/><br/><br/>Instructions:<br/>Click to pop the balloons (You can also click and hold!)<br/><br/>Notes:<br/><ul><li>After each round, the speed of the balloons increases. If you reach round 3, you have to avoid the spiky balloons. Lose all 3 lives and you lose!\u00a0<br/></li><li>This is the first project to have an extended stage! I plan on doing this for the rest of my projects.<br/></li><li>There are some glitches in the game, like a balloon that doesn't move in the bottom at Round 3, and being able to pop a balloon when you have 0 lives, but I will fix those and alot more soon! Give me suggestions on what to make!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T03:47:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94bfbe7910c1024a7757ac0df7826bd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NickGamesG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
