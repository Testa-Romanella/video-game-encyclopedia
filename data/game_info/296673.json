You only have two to worry about, <strong>wood</strong> and <strong>stone</strong>, and both are simply resources you spend to <strong>Build Projects</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is a <strong>rotate</strong> button, click it to rotate the indicated face of your cube planet.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is the <strong>Harvest</strong> button. It will remove all resources on the <strong>top face</strong> of the cube, and add the associated <strong>wood</strong> or <strong>stone</strong> to your resources. The amount you get starts at one per tile, but will go up as you build more projects.</p>\n\n<p>This is the <strong>build</strong> button. Use this to open and close the build interface.</p>\n\n<p>This is an example of a <strong>Build Project</strong>. It costs 45 wood (W) and 21 stone (S). This particular one means you win the game once you build it, although the game will not tell you this. You will however know in your heart that you did it, congratulations!</p>\n<p>All other build projects will increase your harvested amount from each tile, based on the table below. As you can see, the rewarded amount per tile increases pretty drastically as you build more projects!<br/></p>\n<p>If you harvest your planet completely and cannot build the WinGame project, I'm afraid <strong>you have lost</strong>. Please try again!<br/></p>\r\nTier I<br/>Tier IITier III2414", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/467/467236495ec2fe6d3cda7ce84c102826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["osis"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
