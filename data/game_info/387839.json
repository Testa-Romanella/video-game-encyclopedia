So it is very small and not too good.\r\n But it certainly works and I am very proud of it. This is also just a prototype, hence the small size of the game.\r\n Maybe I will return to this project later.\r\nBut at least if you have played the game or if you are going to play it.\r\n Have fun and leave a comment if you have a bug or feedback.\r\nBye\r\nRobbin", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:22:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3ca8bd1eb1913a1516c9b7751f0b78a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Dev Kid"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
