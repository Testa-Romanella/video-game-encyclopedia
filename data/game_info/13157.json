The Necromancer has destroyed the wizard order, leaving only you alive. You must venture through the ever changing Necrospire to bring him to justice. <br/><br/><strong>Discover a wealth of loot</strong><br/>The Necrospire is brimming with loot, granting powerful (and sometimes unusual) effects. Mythical items await those able to reach the highest floors of the Necrospire, bestowing extraordinary abilities. <br/><br/><strong>Define your build</strong><br/>Choose how you want to fight with an inventory system that allows you to change your build on the go.<br/><br/><strong>Harness the power of magic</strong><br/>Equip spell tomes to modify your attacks. Slow your enemies, burn them to a crisp or even freeze them in time. Up to 5 spell tomes can be equipped at once, combining their effects together. <br/><br/><strong>Up the challenge for greater rewards</strong><br/>Enable difficulty modifiers such as double bosses and exploding enemies, making the Necrospire far more dangerous but increasing your chances of finding rarer loot.<br/><br/><strong>Equip ancient relics</strong><br/>Use powerful relics to summon companions to your side, teleport yourself across a room, fire deadly volleys of arrows and much, much more.<br/><br/><strong>Face challenging enemies</strong><br/>Powerful foes await you as you climb the Necrospire. Use your equipment, spells and relics to even the odds.<br/><br/><strong>A new experience each time</strong><br/>Each journey into the Necrospire is randomly generated; no two runs will be the same.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8f/b8f076aca2328577eddafaa55cba7d8f.jpg", "website": "http://www.necrospire.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 107}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike Watson", "Bad Duck Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mike Watson", "Bad Duck Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
