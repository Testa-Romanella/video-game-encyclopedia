This maybe because he likes to be his own biggest critic, only to then give himself glowing reviews. Garland is a stickler for tidiness, in fact, his motto is \"PUT THAT BACK WHERE IT BELONGS!\".<br/><br/><br/>Vandamme<br/><br/>The most mysterious and adventurous Resonator. Plays just about any musical instrument and understands any scientific advice. Take charge of capturing the audio signal generated by the group to whichever format is prevalent to the era in which they find themselves.<br/><br/><br/>Carlton<br/><br/>No one has every been able to pin down exactly what Carlton does. Obsesses over finding a link between science and mysticism but only ever seems to be proving a link between alcohol and bad decisions. Plays guitar, synthesizers and supplies baritone vocals. Prefers to do anything but actual, tangible work, proclaims he was born with a rare disease called 'Cannotbearseditus'.<br/><br/><br/>Frithel<br/><br/>If Frithel could change every choice to include the suffix 'or science?' he would always choose the latter. This man is obsessed with science - he lives, breathes, digests and inserts science. He carasses, high fives and smooches science, he... okay you get the picture. Also plays Drums, loves the Bee Gees and spoken word poetry... in a sciencey kind of way.<br/><br/><br/>Auto<br/><br/>Auto is short for Automaton, and is the groups robotic aid and protector. Over time he has developed a fondness for Carlton, due to the time that Mr. Breezy has invested in playing with Auto. From darts, to movies, to arcade machines and to the definite chagrin of the other chaps, as this reduces the time that Auto could be tidying, computing and generally busying himself around the ship in a non-creepy android going-to-kill-all-humans way.<br/><br/><br/>Chladni<br/><br/>Chladni is in charge of sub 400hz vibrations and is a celebrated player of the Low Frequency Guitar. His motto is \"Nimble of finger - nimble of mind!\". Plus, he can't keep his mind off the ladies and sees himself as some sort of lothario, of which his motto is also \"Nimble of finger - nimble of mind!\".", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T03:36:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fb/2fbc75308fabd193fce074425fbb72c6.jpg", "website": "https://bumble3ee.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bumble3ee Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["BUMBLE3EE INTERACTIVE SL."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
