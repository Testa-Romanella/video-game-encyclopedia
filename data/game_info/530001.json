Now mow them down.</p>\r\nCircuitry\r\n<p><em>Circuitry</em> is a 2D top-down twin-stick roguelike shooter heavily inspired by 2015 indie hit\u00a0<em>Nuclear Throne</em>. The player is a robot with the ability to dash and wield guns. Guide them through an infinite journey\u00a0as they make their way through dangerous abandoned wastelands, run down by hostile and armed drones.<br/></p>\r\nWolverineSoft Studio\r\n<p><em>Circuitry\u00a0</em>was created by a 25-person team at the University of Michigan's WolverineSoft Studio, a semester-long voluntary student games studio. It is an educational case study on Vlambeer's <em>Nuclear Throne</em>, and takes heavy inspiration from its UI and game mechanics.\u00a0This project was in development from September 6th, 2020, to December 6th, 2020.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<strong>Producers</strong>Amber Renton<br/>Nico Williams<strong>Art Directors</strong>George Castle<br/>Rachel Liu<strong>Audio Directors</strong>Bradley Gurwin<br/>Logan Hughes<strong>Design Director</strong>Matthew Rader<strong>Programming Director</strong>Billy Bostick<strong>Pod Leads</strong>Angela Salacata<br/>Brandon Schulz<br/>Natasha Badami<br/>Naveen Sabharwal<br/>Rachel Liu<strong>Art</strong>Amber Renton<br/>Dilan Huang<br/>George Castle<br/>Grace Ma<br/>Kaavya Ramachandhran<br/>Lisa Cao<br/>Lucy Zhang\r\n<br/>Naveen Sabharwal\r\n<br/>Rachel Liu<br/>AudioAhmad Faiyaz\r\n<br/>Bradley Gurwin\r\n<br/>Conor Egan\r\n<br/>Emily Sulkey\r\n<br/>Faulkner Bodbyl-Mast\r\n<br/>Heidi Schmidt\r\n<br/>Kevin Zhu\r\n<br/>Kiva Nguyen\r\n<br/>Logan Hughes\r\n<br/>Steve KlingbielDesignBrandon Schulz\r\n<br/>Brian Mealey\r\n<br/>Eli Neumann\r\n<br/>Matthew Rader\r\n<br/>Rob SworProgrammingAngela Salacata\r\n<br/>CheWei Wang\r\n<br/>Kewei Han\r\n<br/>Kristen Worden\r\n<br/>Natasha Badami\r\n<br/>Robert Keller\r\n<br/>Seyhyun Yang\r\n<br/>Zewen WuAdvisorAustin Yarger<br/>MentorsJames Kotzian\r\n<br/>Jordan Ajlouni\r\nSponsors\r\n<p>The following organizations are supporting the next generation of world class game developers.
