Fulfill up to 9 or more types of orders for your patrons as you wrestle with the intricacies of properly preparing a meal. Make sure not to take too long though - customers don't like to be kept waiting!

At the end of the hour, you will be evaluated on your performance - are you a Jerome or just a Tim?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Every item in <em>One Hour at Jerome's</em> is interacted with via the mouse and a revolutionary click-and-drag system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Excerpt from <em>Coquo Immortalitatis; or, the Ways in Which I Feed Myself</em> by Elian Hoffman.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\"<em>Frites</em>:       </p>\n<p>1. Grab 1 (one) potato from the potato bag.       </p>\n<p>2. Finely slice the potato with a knife by dragging it. <strong>Make sure that your knife is sharp enough!</strong> <strong>A   pass over the sharpening stone should sharpen any dull knife, although   it should be noted that oversharpening your knife is the 14th most   common cause of heightened feelings of anxiety in chefs</strong> worldwide (Schirinzi, 2014).       </p>\n<p>3. Dip the frites in a deep fryer 1 (one) to 3 (three) times depending on how well-done you want your fries. <strong>It is important to make sure you don't dip the fries into the fryer too fast</strong>, as oil splatters are the 4th most common cause of injury in chefs worldwide (Schirinzi, 2015).       </p>\n<p>4. Spritz some sauce over the frites by picking up a sauce bottle and holding it over them to squeeze it. <strong>Make sure that you shake the bottle well before attempting to squeeze it though</strong> - although no studies have been conducted at this time, the author is commonly frustrated by this occurrence.     Congratulations! You have now made frites!\"\r\n<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Goal: </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Satisfy the customer's orders and serve it to them by dragging it to them. Make sure to make the orders quickly and with proper usage of your kitchen tools in order to minimize the amount that your heart rate increases throughout the game.

My earliest memories are of walking into the market on a brisk spring morning and smelling all of the delicious food that was there. \u00a0One particularly memorable incident happened with the farmer who had their stand set up right near the entrance to the market. As I walked in, small child that I was, I ran over to the stand and told my Ma \"I want to eat one of those tomatoes!\" The farmer running the stand was a kindly old man who I later learned the name of but then forgot again, but it definitely starts with a G. He overheard me asking Ma about the tomatoes and motioned for her to come over to him. He then whispered back and forth with Ma and then Ma exclaimed, \"The farmer G---- (sorry I can't remember his whole name) over here said he would give you one of his tomatoes! Make sure you tell him thank you!\" I looked over at the farmer and barely had time to yell an excited \"Thanks!\" before picking up and then taking a big chomp out of it. Juice dribbled down my face as my senses were overwhelmed with the smell and taste of a delicious, ripe tomato. Ever since then, I have been looking to replicate that experience with all different types of foods. After many years of experimentation I think that I have created a french fry recipe that will give you the same incredible experience that that tomato did for me so many years ago.\"<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>YourLordBagel</p>\n<p>alion8me</p>\n<p>Three of the end screens by one of alion8me's brothers (thank you!)</p>\n<p>Sounds from Freesound.org (all public domain)</p>\n<p>Made using Godot<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T17:29:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cd/0cdd64a9539bcdd5b53463e1107d6933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alion8me", "YourLordBagel"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
