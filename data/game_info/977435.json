Each passage presents new challenges as you explore procedurally generated ruins full of enemies to fight and treasures to find.<h3>Danger and Reward Await</h3><br/>The deeper you go, the greater the rewards, but also the greater the danger. Gather powerful weapons, bizarre hats and tasty snacks to prepare for epic battles against rats, demon lords, dragons and half a dozen goblins. Beware of the GREED curse that afflicts wealthy dwarves, making escape to the top all the more perilous the greater your booty.<h3>Master Dwarf Combat</h3><br/>Master deep combat mechanics combining axes, shields, legendary armor and salamis. Discover strange magical artifacts among piles of gold and gems. But know when to stop - death is permanent in the depths, so use your gold and courage wisely.<h3>Become the Richest Dwarf</h3><br/>Dwarf Looter blends reduced inventory management leading to highly improvised situations and choices, procedural generation, turn-based combat and a light RPG progression in a humorous fantasy world. Can you defeat the final boss and become the richest dwarf, or will you die of a mushroom overdose first?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T13:21:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c8/9c8d2e60eb4d112d30e2fc7ffdd9c9fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orbi Universo Team"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Orbi Universo Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
