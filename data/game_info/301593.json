With new engine, sweet new graphics, and a total update of presentation, and interface. This is not just a high definition version, but a new gameplay experience.The Great RacesThe game is focused on the dominant races of Humans, Elves and Orcs with each able to recruit from other races depending on the alliances, techs and buildings they have available.

The three Orders of Wizards have also each aligned themselves with one of the great races, and use their vast magical power to shift the course of battle with terrifying Lightning Storms and devastating Blizzards.Story-driven CampaignPlay an epic story-driven singleplayer campaign combining engaging cinematic narrative and original gameplay to determine the fate of the three great races as they try to survive in a world engulfed by total war after they fall out of favour with the gods.Skirmish BattleEngage in the complex city building and economy of a fast paced skirmish environment as you gather resources, construct buildings, reinforce walls and train troops before being swept up in field and siege battles with up to four players or AI. Craft the right Techs and Cards, and perfect your strategy and play style to ensure that victory is yours.Survival ModeThe dead have risen and are marching towards your settlement with blood-thirsty determination.
