Make them join together and get them to their goal. There are 5 levels in total.<br/></p>\n<p>Submission for GMTK jam 2021</p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<p>The objective of the game is to get the required amount of slimes to the goal.</p>\n<p>You start by controlling one slime. By touching other slimes you will control them at the same time. Your keybinds bind to all of them at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You will find a few special types of obstacles that hopefully explain themselves.</p>\n<p>Have fun playing!</p>\n<p>Also check the walkthrough if you get stuck somewhere<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Movement with WAD or arrow keys</li><li>R to Reset the level</li><li>X to remove all text from level screen (IDK why I made that)</li><li>Enter to go to next level if current level is cleared</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>All art by me</li><li>All code by me</li><li>Font: Bitpotion by Joeb Rogers</li><li>Nostalgia - Dance by Patricia Taxxon</li><li>Interface\u00a0 &amp; Impact sounds from kenney.nl</li><li>Sound effects from zapsplat.com</li><li>Bell Shot sound effect by sandyrb from here</li></ul>\r\nOther:\r\n<p>This was my first gamejam with such a short timeframe, so I didn't have a good feel for how much I could have made in that time. Overall quite happy with the result though. I tried to make it colorblind friendly at least, wanted to do key rebinding but ran out of time.<br/></p>\n<p>Difficulty scales a bit fast, but hey, with 5 levels what are you gonna do.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:34:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a481ed45a2308c9c1786ddfa43df694.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Deep-Fold"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
