This game was created for the Vimjam, under the focus of collectables and the theme \"There and back\". This is is my first time at a game jam, and the second project that I create with Unity.\r\n<p>Zogda it's a simple game where you use the mouse to move towards the desired position just by clicking with the limitation that our character always returns to the same point, a mechanic inspired by the theme of this game jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As for the limitaions for the jam, I could only deliver for the one about easter eggs; as you can see, you can unlock certian secret planets if you manage to get a high score, more details in the main menu.</p>\n<p>The story part of this game it's a little simple, I was looking for a lovecraftian vibe, but this is what I came up with.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for playing! I would really appreciate a rate.</p>\r\nNote: I ran into some troubles when I created the build for webGL in Unity, so for time reasons I found a temporal solution by adding a development build, the game runs, but it takes like 30 seconds to load,\u00a0my apologies. I recommend to check the Zogda.zip file for Windows for a better experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-30T12:04:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/276/276e0e015a434fe5ba2865416e213759.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["spiderhead20"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
