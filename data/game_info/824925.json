From avoiding the hands of others to defeating a dragon, there's a lot in store for our couple and for our red guy to go through.</p>\n\n<p>Will they ever reconnect, or were they just not meant to be?\r\n</p>\n\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\n<p>Each game will have their own set of control scheme, but they only use WASD and Mouse inputs. You can exit a mini-game by pressing the Escape button.</p>\n\n<strong>Credits:</strong>\n<p><strong>Programmer: </strong>Jon Jacob Allauigan</p>\n<p><strong>Art Designers: </strong>Jerico Galang and Sophia Mercado</p>\n\n<strong>External Assets:</strong>\n<p><strong>BGM:</strong></p>\n<p>Up In My Jam - Kubbi</p>\n<p>8bit Dungeon Boss - Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Pixelland - Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Retro Soul - Benjamin Tissot</p>\n\n<p><strong>SFX:</strong></p>\n<p>Retro SFX Pack - 3rd Note Inc.</p>\n<p>SwordSoundPack - Edoardo Gigan</p>\n<p>Vehicle - Essentials - Nox_Sound</p>\n<p>Free Crowd Cheering Sounds - Gregor Quendel</p>\n<p>Subway interior ambience - mixkit</p>\n<p>Calm park with people and children - mixkit</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Artworks:</strong></p>\n<p>Pixel Art Cave Background - Lil Cthulhu</p>\n<p>12x12-rpg-tileset - Cyporkador</p>\n<p>Lipizzan picture - Conversano Isabella</p>\n<p>UI Pack: RPG Expansion - Kenney.nl<br/></p><p>Pixel Art Effect - FX084 - NYKNCK<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Font:</strong></p>\n<p>Short Stack - James Grieshaber</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T18:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b1/2b17e2a3e2c1f3ce098f293cada4a9ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["RippandT"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
