Inside is a prerecorded message\u00a0which reveals to them that they have been selected by the Kardrians, an extinct alien race, to take on the mantle of the <strong>Zemstars</strong>.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Historically, the Kardrians\u00a0 selected one champion from each of planet Kardria's four moons to become a <strong>Zemstar,\u00a0</strong>a warrior\u00a0who\u00a0wields ancient magical artifacts known as the <strong>Kards</strong>. The Zemstars\u00a0used the power of the Kards\u00a0to enforce peace, and to retaliate against invaders.</p>\n<p>The galactic conquerors that wiped out their race are now headed towards Earth, and it falls upon Maja, Daria, Estera and Kasia - the\u00a0first human Zemstars - to use the power of the Kards\u00a0to defend Earth and avenge the Kardrians.</p>\n\n<p>Zemstar Assault\u00a0was originally made in one month (Feb. 15 to March 15, 2022)\u00a0for the\u00a0Magical Girl Game Jam 5! \u00a0It's my first formally published game and my first game jam game, and although the vision I initially had for it was quite a bit bigger, I'm\u00a0happy with how it turned out and it was a fantastic\u00a0learning experience.
