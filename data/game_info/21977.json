The sleepy sloth left his home because of a butterfly effect (literally) and now he wants to return. Road home is divided into very short (from a few seconds long) but tricky stages. To complete this hard path you have to hone your driving skills and learn every track.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most tracks have multiple routes (remember: the shortest is not always the fastest) and some even contains moving platforms. Physics model is not quite arcade so watch your speed!<br/>Game has some visual car customization, but there are no performance upgrades - only your skills can improve the results.Features<ul><li>60 short but challenging levels<br/></li><li>Unlockable visual car customization<br/></li><li>Hidden collectible on every level<br/></li><li>Ghost of your best result<br/></li><li>Top-10 best results with ghosts for each level<br/></li><li>Cute sloth<br/></li><li>Controller support</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67c/67cafa2d4e2ff53c3e9f433179b602ca.jpg", "website": "http://onebraverobot.com/slowdrive", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["onebraverobot"], "genres": ["Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["onebraverobot"], "esrb_rating": null}
