Draw a route for each cat on the roof. You must prevent them from encountering or coming into contact with electric fences and ventilation equipment.<br/><br/>Your objective is to make these cats reach their respective destinations without meeting along the way, preventing them from fighting. No matter how you draw the lines, find your own way to create a safe path for each kitten. Draw the route that the cats will take by clicking on them and dragging the mouse over the roof. While drawing the route, you must avoid colliding with obstacles and other cats, otherwise you will have to start over.<br/><br/>Each level you complete unlocks the next roof. Can you avoid all the cat fights that are about to take place on the neighborhood rooftops? We hope so! Give it a try and show that you are a real roof peacemaker.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/>\ud83d\ude3dDesigned for lovers of logic puzzles and cats;<br/>\ud83e\udde950 handcrafted stages to be solved;<br/>\ud83c\udfb5Soundtrack to keep you immersed in the game;<br/>\ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f Beautiful city to go through until the end of the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T05:58:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93bf2180220bc9cf7e111daf99666bfe.jpg", "website": "https://www.minicactusgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Minicactus Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Minicactus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
