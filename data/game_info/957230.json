To be exact - you edit certain words (more on that in the <em>Tutorial\u00a0</em><em>level</em>). By editing the words you earn money depending on the difference in meaning of the new words. Besides money you also will loose reputation. The goal is to keep decent amount or rep for each day without dying of starvation.</p>\r\nWhat's the goal of the playtest?\r\n<p>This playtest will help us balance out the levels and fix some bugs players might find. <strong>You can use links below to leave feedback:</strong><br/><strong>Playtest poll -\u00a0</strong><strong>https://forms.gle/AUPaL88at7cCAELJ9\u00a0<br/></strong><strong>Bug report -\u00a0</strong><strong>https://forms.gle/qZ46eQeRHaWuin258</strong><br/><br/>Also playtesters can suggest what should be added/changed to the game. All the playtesters will be included in the credits.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the playtest ends we will balance the levels according to you feedback and add some more stuff:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Recompose all the music and make more of it</li><li>Some easter eggs</li><li>Each day having a bit different scenery</li><li>Some new details</li><li>Something you suggested</li></ul>\r\nHow many levels are there?\r\n<p>5, almost each one having a positive and negative versions:</p>\n<ul><li>Day 1</li><li>Day 2 Positive</li><li>Day 2 Negative</li><li>Day 3 Positive</li><li>Day 3 Negative</li><li>Day 4 Positive</li><li>Day 4 Negative</li><li>Day 5 Positive</li><li>Day 5 Negative</li></ul>\n<p>What version of the day will be chosen is dependent on your reputation in the previous day. If you loose certain percent of rep your next day will be negative. So in theory you can always return on the positive path, although it is very hard to do so.</p>\n\r\nMade by WDALG:\r\n<p><strong>SolidP</strong> -\u00a0Game designer,\u00a0 3D artist, 2D artist, Sound designer, Music composer,\u00a0 Software engineer, Programmer.<br/><strong>Reedly</strong> - Art director, 3D artist, 2D artist, UI Artist.<br/><strong>Cxolax</strong> - 3D artist.<br/><strong>Gibus </strong>- 3D artist.<br/><strong>Denod</strong> - Music composer.</p>\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\n<p>Ydav<br/>Ligtsource<br/>Salty<br/>TheGodOfClowns</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T19:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6e/c6e6a975b7004f153946f46f0ff52b5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["W-DALG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
