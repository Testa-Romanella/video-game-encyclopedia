Getting it to testing to see if it looks or feels fun.</p>\n<p>Please leave comments or come to the\u00a0Discord and have a chat!</p>\n<p><strong>Info:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>It's a Rhythm Monster Catcher game with Clicker mechanics.</li><li>Every time you hit a note, you will deal a certain amount of damage to the monster in front of you. You can buy Catch Tools (they look like pokeballs for now), the more expensive the Tool, the more catching chance you'll have.</li><li>Leveling monsters is done through catching the same type or tapping XP and then tapping the monster.</li><li>Areas are traversable through the World Map. You can only travel to the next area after you complete 10 monster catches/kills in the previous one.</li><li>The game saves itself pretty often but there's a\u00a0SAVE button just to make sure it's being saved.</li><li>You can only catch monsters at first stage of evolution, any other stage will only add to your XP/Gold.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Roadmap ideas:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Prettier monsters. Could be 3D.</li><li>Cardboard cutout monsters that shoot particles\u00a0</li><li>Each Area is planned to have different songs, objectives, achievements, etc.</li><li>Bosses and\u00a0Gyms/Trainer fights could be in the game at some point.</li><li>Basically everything looking better</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcb/fcb4cf9b8695c7475df29a462374ce3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Natural Power Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
