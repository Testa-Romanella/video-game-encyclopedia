Try to keep every body part under control and don't let the injuries overrun you!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the second quest of the SideQuest Game Jam, the theme was 'connect'. This is the first game I've made with Game Maker after just watching a few tutorials.</p>\n<p>The idea I planned for the game initially included a lot more features, but later I realized that I just don't have the experience and knowledge required to implement them in a reasonable amount of time, still I'm glad I managed to finish something, even if it's simple and not very polished.</p>\n<p>Some of the features I planned included:</p>\n<ul><li>Virus that would spread from body part to body part, and you use white blood cells to fight them.</li><li>You could use red blood cells to 'mine' some kind of 'currency' (something like metabolism) that you could use to purchase more red and white blood cells.</li><li>Powers and abilities that help you keep things under control (e.g. A\u00a0 'Fever' would reduce the power of a disease at the cost of some health, or 'Take pills' which instantly defeats a minor disease).</li></ul>\n<p>Every single asset is made by me, including the graphics and music (which is why everything looks crusty and the music sounds weird). Overall it was a nice learning experience, and a lot of fun.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T02:46:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12f/12f6b8a8041bc12dca0300b85be74e12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ikenet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
