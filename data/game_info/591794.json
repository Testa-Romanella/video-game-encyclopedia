Control the tree\u2019s roots to provide it with water and stability and watch the branches grow! Made in the amazing\u00a0Godot engine\u00a0which I pretty much learned during this Ludum Dare.</p>\n<p>This is a submission\u00a0for Ludum Dare #48. Please see the original submission page.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The tree grows by itself based on its roots, you as the player grow the roots. Use\u00a0<em>WSAD keys and arrow keys</em>\u00a0to control the camera, mouse wheel to zoom. Use the\u00a0<em>mouse to drag roots</em>\u00a0to grow new ones.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are 3 \u201cresources\u201d to watch for:\r\n</p>\r\nEnergy\r\n<p>It is gathered by the leaves of the tree and required to grow roots. I did not have time to add any visual feedback but if you can\u2019t grow a root, you need to wait for more energy. This is the yellow bar.\r\n</p>\r\nWater\r\n<p>Water is required to grow the tree and it is collected by the roots. Grow roots into water tiles to collect them and grow the tree. This is the blue bar.\r\n</p>\r\nStability\r\n<p>This is the red bar. It is based on the size of the tree vs. the size of its roots. I did not really utilize this mechanic, but the tree won\u2019t grow if the stability is too low. If that\u2019s the case, grow more roots!\r\n</p>\r\nGoals\r\n<p>There is no real goal in the game since I had a hard time coming up with meaningful game mechanics. So, the only goal is to grow a nice, big tree and have fun. Make sure to take a screenshot and post it in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T06:49:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b155aa2c9bff0b4db808fa7ef715fe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Martin \"D\u017eejky\" Jakubik"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
