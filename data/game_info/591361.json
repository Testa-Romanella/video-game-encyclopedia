I have been competing in Ludum Dares since 34, when I was 12. Now I am 18 and about to graduate high school. I am going to college for a game programming degree. Ludum Dare and the community has been extremely helpful to me in growing my passion for game development, and I can't wait to continue in the future. I am glad to participate in this milestone: the 48th Ludum Dare 48 hour compo.</p><p>Rate my game here:</p><p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/the-reverse-of-the-summit<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:58:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad7d538527580cc06ab5f118247c9fba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["squigglez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
