The theme was \"Unstable\", and you might be asking how I used the theme in this game. I'll be honest, I did forget about the theme halfway through, so my explanation is a little far-fetched.\u00a0</p>\r\nStory :\r\n<p>Basically, the story is, all of amazon's packages got mixed up, and millions of people lost a lot of they're money. I guess you could say the economy is \"unstable\".\u00a0 And it's your job to go in and sort all of the packages. Pretty simple. Nothing Special.</p>\r\nHow To Play :\r\n<p>Really simple, sort the red and blue boxes on the corresponding side. But look out for black boxes, for those. It would be best if you protect yourself with the shield.</p>\r\nControls :\r\n<p>Left Mouse Click - Sort Red</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Click - Sort Blue</p>\n<p>Space - Activate Shield</p>\r\nFinal Notes :\r\n<p>This was my first ever game jam, and I had a blast. Sorry about no audio, I didn't have time. Looking forward to future game jams. Thanks for playing!</p>\r\nVideo :", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:20:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97e/97e78e063b3c3c1106c1cb81fd7fd24e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jumbo Jump"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
