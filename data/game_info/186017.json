I didn't get arround to scavanging, or any complexity in the enemies. Or fixing a couple of engine bugs &amp; shortcomings, such as sprites sometimes not being removed from the screen, as well as leaks associated with removing PhysicsObject/glue/RenderedObject \"combos\". These things will probably only take a couple hours, but I already spent a lot of time improving the engine during this gamejam. I hope my next gamejam won't have as many engine issues as this one.<br/></p>\n<p>Using my own engine that I had partially done before the gamejam(no game code, just pure engine). Spent a day (+several hours) just fixing the engine. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Linux-only for now</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n\n<p>wasd - move</p>\n<p>q/e - rotate</p>\n\n<p>space - fire bullet <br/></p>\n\n<p>Enemys will spawn randomly arround the starting area. Pressing p will spawn an enemy. Touching a bullet kills you. Enemys die if they touch a bullet. I didn't get arround to all I had planned, but one of my days was just engine development. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/441/441ca4282eb297f74e7098ee5b342a81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["ai221"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
