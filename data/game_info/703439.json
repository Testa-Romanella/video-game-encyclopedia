There's not a lot of baskets in Explorb, but the original idea came from creating something around ball handling and a tweet from ChevyRay about building exploration in 2D:</p>\r\nthinking about 2D game exploration again and how much it frustrates me with its limitations. constantly trying to figure out ways to give myself a sense of exploration when the amazing discovery benefits of 3D cannot be applied.<br/>...<br/>the absence of \u201clooking\u201d alone is just, so debilitating. you can\u2019t look off in the distance, you can\u2019t wonder what\u2019s around a corner, you can\u2019t see a goal from far away, you can\u2019t worry about what might be behind you.\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Move with LS or wasd/arrows.\r\n</li><li>Throw/push the ball with RB or left click.\r\n</li><li>Pull/catch the ball with LB or right click.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nRegrets\r\n<p>I didn't manage to make it as far as I'd hoped on this project, but the complete gameloop is there: use the explorb to clear away debris, explore, and discover what awaits. I wanted to add more movement, more hints at what's hidden beneath the debris.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to experiment with the ball controls more to give more gameplay to tossing the ball around.</p>\n<p>Maybe I'll revisit it in the future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:20:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f67f2012c6b31b7fcc6dfe64966453e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["idbrii"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
