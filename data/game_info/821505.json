{"id": 821505, "slug": "diceroll-cavefight", "name": "Diceroll Cavefight", "name_original": "Diceroll Cavefight", "description": "Summary\r\n<p>You are a living dice, with a random roll cast a magic onto yourself. Unlike many, the only bad outcome is the neutral no effect. If you roll 1 to 3, you heal in an instant; if 4, a speed increase; 5 give you more strength; no effect if landed on 6. Everytime you roll, the speed and strength returns to normal. You have a roll attack as well, which don't trigger the magic.</p>\n<p>Now to today, you want to take a shortcut through a super small cave, when a shady figure was inside, he can shoot fire, summon non-dice entities, and let out a soundless beam. He look's like he don't want any exposers alive, looks like it's time to battle!</p>\n<p>This game is for the GMTK(Game Maker's Toolkit) Game Jam 2022 for the theme Roll of the Dice.
