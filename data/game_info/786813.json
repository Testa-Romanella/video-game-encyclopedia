Catch the maggots and sacrifice them to your god in order to get in it's good graces. Fail .... and you'll reap it's scorn.\" <br/></p>\n<p>This short game is controlled with the mouse. Click on items (tv, newspaper etc...) to interact with them. Clicking on maggots will catch and add them to your pool. At the end of each day you'll be asked to sacrifice maggots. The numbers on the jar label indicate the amount of maggots that you have, the number on the bowl how much you'll have to sacrifice. HINT: You don't have to meet a demand every time if you think it's very high. You can fail a bunch of times before you'll get punished. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:32:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9dac50f6282e662b54ee9ab91e42f70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunshine_Error"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
