I had a lot of work over the weekend.</p>\n<p>But here it is.</p>\n<p>Its a simple shooter, but your bullets will hit you and damage the terrain.</p>\n<p>You can also collect the remnants of the enemies to fuel up a power up .</p>\n<p>I'll list them here after I've submitted everything.</p>\n<p>It runs on a custom engine, but this is the first I've published anything using OpenGL.</p>\n<p>As far as my tests suggest, it runs at ~60 fps and never dips below 20.</p>\n<p>I cannot speak for how much CPU usage or Memory Usage it will take on your machines, but on my Desktop it only used a few megabytes of RAM and negligible amounts\u00a0of my processor usage.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Left and Right to move, Space (Hold for different altitude) to fire a shot.</p>\n<p>Don't get hit by your own bullets.</p>\n\n<p>Red Power is standard</p>\n<p>Green Power allows your bullets to bounce off of enemies</p>\n<p>Blue Power can rebuild the terrain</p>\n<p>Yellow power makes you faster</p>\n<p>Magenta power makes you score double points</p>\n<p>Cyan power gives you super bullets.</p>\n\n<p>This game was so very rushed, to the point where much content was left out.</p>\n<p>It lacks polish and most likely has bugs, so have fun with it I guess.</p>\n<p>\"A delayed game is only delayed until it is released, but a rushed game is rushed forever\"</p>\n<p>If you are interested or at least intrigued by the concept, I'd be glad to release a polished, finished version. Thanks for your feedback.</p><p>#UPDATE</p><p>Bug fixed and slightly more playable version available (Version 1.1)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T18:30:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3d/f3dd351a6b99a4993ef6029c9629dcc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carter15"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
