Using this ability, Shrek is able to glitch through platforms and take massive shortcuts in his adventure.\u00a0But he doesn't like Airteleporting. That's why he's trying to beat his worst enemy in this epic platformer in order to be able to jump again.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>AD = Left &amp; Right</p>\n<p>Space = Airteleport</p>\n<p>CTRL = Restart level</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Click = Shoot bullets</p>\n<p>Software used:</p>\n<p>- Game Maker Studio 2</p>\n<p>- GIMP</p>\n<p>Developer Note:</p>\n<p>This is just some short Shrek fangame with a lot of bugs. At the beginning Airteleporting was just a glitch but I noticed that it was a lot more fun than casual jumping.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:22:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba6/ba66689ba7ad6807690f334b275e6bbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HarambeStudios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
