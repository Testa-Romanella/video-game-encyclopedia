Although the solving portion I note instead of 3 tries I accidentally gave punters a free extra go.</p>\n<p>I have had a little slump in my Gamedev journey and found the 2 day pressure tough, still I made something and I am happy to share it for feedback.</p>\n<p>If I had more time besides fixing little bugs, I would like to add more juice, sfx and music. As I am now heading to bed and these things are front of mind but nearly 1 am Kiwi time - I think I will let myself call it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T10:29:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eac/eac89da6a4454a4230ffd4c6e1356451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RicoTV"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
