Kids will love choosing the characters and story lines, whilst improving their word recognition ability; a vital component to reading.  In short, they'll be learning and not even know it!  On top of that, they will be developing their creativity, as they let their imaginations bloom.<br/><br/>When a child chooses a story, it is read aloud to them, with each word being highlighted as it is spoken.  At certain points in each story, the child is offered a choice of six characters to choose from.  When they pick one, the story continues with that character in it.  At the end of the story, there is the option for the completed story to be read back to the child.<br/><br/>The three stories each have a different style:<br/><br/>'Big Bad Wolf' is a variation on the classic children's story of the Three Little Pigs.  In this adventure, children will enjoy choosing the three little characters and what their houses are made of, as the wolf attempts to blow their houses down.<br/><br/>'Pirate Ship' is a lovely rhyming story, in which the child chooses characters to come aboard a pirate ship for an adventure.  This story is available with an in-app purchase.<br/><br/>'Wishes' truly indulges a child's imagination, as their chosen character makes a special wish and sees that wish come true.  This story is available with an in-app purchase.<br/><br/>Most importantly, it is well known that laughter induces learning and these stories are sure to get your children giggling in their seats!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:20:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/265/265ad80df83bdc0afd6db3544694ad39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Daniel MILLWOOD"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Daniel MILLWOOD"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
