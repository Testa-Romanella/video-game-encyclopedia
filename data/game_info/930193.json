But this game has no gravity. You can take all the time you need to place each block as you see fit.</p><p>You may also be interested in the original C version which comes with music and a replay feature.</p><p>https://chastitywhiterose.itch.io/chaste-tris<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T16:12:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f18/f189d6c9eee506f25cc73150e1715c09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chastitywhiterose"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
