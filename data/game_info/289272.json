When the theme of the game jam \"What does home mean to you?\" was announced, Tommy Lee (who came to the Game Jam with the intention to write a song) came up with this idea where the game itself involves composing a song based on who's around you.\u00a0 \u00a0And so we defined \"home\" as where our friends are, and we convey these feelings of friendship through emotional music.</p>\n<p>For me (Dominic Napoleon), I came into the game jam\u00a0 out of frustration.\u00a0 I had been working on a game of my own for a while with little progress due to all sorts of issues (self discipline, inherent difficulties with VR programming, etc...), and the idea of just popping out an entire game in two days seemed like a really cool way to get a breath of fresh air, to get the ball rolling.\u00a0 I think jams of all sorts (like NaNoWriMo and Inktober for instance) are great ways to pull out of ruts, especially when caused by self doubt or crushing perfectionism.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0definitely feel a lot better now.\u00a0 Even though the game we made isn't going to make headlines, it's a complete game nonetheless and I'm fairly proud of finishing it.\u00a0 Now to get back to that other game I've been working on for a while... Maybe a mixture of :D and :O</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\r\nOriginal\u00a0Concept, Music Composition, DialogueTommy LeeProgrammingDominic Napoleon, Tommy\u00a0LeeArtworkTyler Samson\r\n<p>Special thanks to Bublup for hosting an amazing game jam!
