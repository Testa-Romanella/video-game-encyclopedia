You must work against the game to gather the eight oneiric doors before the deck runs out. You can obtain door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row or by discarding one of your powerful key cards when a door appears from the deck. In both cases, you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to the exciting solo mode, players will enjoy the intuitive user interface, automated deck management, and stats to track their progress and successes against the game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnirim includes: <br/>\r\n\u2022 Shadi Torbey's base Onirim game in solitaire mode<br/>\r\n\u2022 2 expansions: The Glyphs (free) &amp; Crossroads and Dead Ends ($0.99)<br/>\r\n\u2022 Original artwork from the base game by Philippe Guerin and Elise Plessis, enhanced by animations<br/>\r\n\u2022 Solo play<br/>\r\n\u2022 Detailed, interactive, turn-by-turn, in-game tutorial<br/>\r\n\u2022 Scoring sytem with global leaderboard<br/>\r\n\u2022 Offline stats record so you can track your progress<br/>\r\n\u2022 Languages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish<br/>\n<br/>\r\n***One of my favorite solitaire games! - Zee Garcia, The Dice Tower<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFind all the latest news for Onirim on Facebook, Instgram, Twitter and Youtube!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-01T08:56:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abb471baec91ccd03c5351f894b28e4d.jpeg", "website": "http://www.asmodee-digital.com/onirim", "rating": 3.89, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 162, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 58, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Asmodee Digital", "Playsoft", "Z-Man Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games", "Casual", "Card"], "publishers": ["Asmodee Digital"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
