However, the mechanic is only working correctly with a couple of stationary ghosts inside the mansion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While riddled with bugs and not perfect by any standard, my teammate and I learned a lot in the creation of this game, and hope to join many game jams in the future.</p>\n<p>Level Design: Steven Reynoso</p>\n<p>Mechanics/Player Controller: Anthony Olivera (Banquoslayer)</p>\n\n<p>Assets Used:</p>\n\n<p>- Flooded Grounds by Sandro T - Big Furniture Pack by Vertex Studio</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Alchemy Lab Props by Mana Station\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Outdoor Ground Textures by A dog's life software\u00a0</p>\n<p>- QA Books by QAtmo - Realistic Tree 9[Rainbow Tree] by Pixel Games</p>\n<p>-Simple Ghost by Gabriele Punzo (https://www.cgtrader.com/gabrielepunzo)</p>\n<p>-Procedural Fire by HOVL Studios</p><p>-Dark Forest by McFunkyPants (https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/27010/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df1/df176b56d0be8085ddc26b0463700121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Banquoslayer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
