If you like the genre of Arkanoid, then you will definitely like it! The speed of the cue ball is not so great, so that even the smallest gamers can play the game. And energetic electronic music will not let you relax throughout the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/767/767c30283cffadebe9291782393b8f63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 38, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MikasSV"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freshtrax"], "esrb_rating": null}
