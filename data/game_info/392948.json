{"id": 392948, "slug": "20-second-miner", "name": "20 Second Miner", "name_original": "20 Second Miner", "description": "<p>Mine as many ores as you can in 20 floors of a collapsing mine, and do try to make it out alive!\u00a0You only have 20 seconds on each floor to gather as much as you can before escaping to the next floor. Some rarities are locked behind puzzles that require quick thinking to solve.\u00a0There are also a few other things hidden throughout the mine for those daring enough to get them under the stress of the clock.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the GameMaker 20 Jam, which was a week long game jam celebrating GameMaker's 20 anniversary. This game was made in GameMaker Studio 2, and every asset\u00a0was created from scratch (music, SFX, art, code) in a week, with the exception being\u00a0just a few small scripts that I ported over from another game maker project.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Comment below your high score (in dollars), and definitely link a screen shot if you manage to get the jeweled trophy during the win screen... even I couldn't do that!</p>\n<p>#GM20</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T07:01:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58c/58c6c25175aa8a5f39f5ccc4e77a633b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hectorlph"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
