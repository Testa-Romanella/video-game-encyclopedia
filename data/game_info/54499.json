Strongest Habu Shogi) is a Japanese virtual board game for the Nintendo 64 developed and published by Seta. It was released exclusively in Japan on June 23, 1996 as one of the Nintendo 64's three Japanese launch games alongside Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64. It was the only launch game to use the Controller Pak. The game's \"special guest\" is the shogi player Yoshiharu Habu, who won all seven major shogi championships the year of the game's release. Though it was anticipated that the game would be a bestseller and a major showcase for the Nintendo 64's processing power, sales were not high, with only about one copy accompanying every one hundred consoles sold at the system launch. Seta released a sequel titled Morita Shogi 64, which was announced at Nintendo Space World in 1996.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:53", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["SETA"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["SETA"], "esrb_rating": null}
