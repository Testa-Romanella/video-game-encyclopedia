It\u00a0stores all player data from player high score and level completion to\u00a0any options changed during the course of gameplay. The game is quite difficult, so if you find yourself wanting to try out or see the levels following one you're stuck on, there's a switch in the options menu that unlocks all levels.</p>\n<p>Level 0 and Level 1 are unlocked from the get go. If you're interested in the story of Stretchy Protector, you can find most of that info in Level 0, though other bits are sprinkled out throughout menu's and levels.</p>\n<p>Level 6 is the final part of the story, as well as a shake up of the game's mechanics and core gameplay loops, so be sure to check out that level in particular!</p>\n<p>Stretchy Protector is the first game jam game and first game in general developed by Xenoxx and Truxten, with the amazing music courtesy of Thievius.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing our game, and we'd love to hear any feedback or questions anyone may have! Have a great day!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T04:51:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/294f2e0b21b227b84fd1de4adbbaa03e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Xenoxx17", "Truxten"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
