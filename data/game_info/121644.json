You must make sure the current reaches the positive end of the circuit without causing a short circuit, and light up all the light bulbs if any are present.</p>\n<p>This game is complete as it is but I'm open to any suggestions to improve it. It's also totally free but donations are welcome!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Click and hold a tile, move the cursor in the direction you want it to move and release the mouse button. The tile will slide one square in that direction. When you want to turn the current on, click on the green \"play\" button. You can click on it a second time to speed it up. If you make a mistake, click on the button again to clear the current.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/310/3105bfdce3ded3c60ef2a03bb1547180.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["David Jalbert"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
