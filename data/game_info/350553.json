{"id": 350553, "slug": "between-planets", "name": "Between Planets", "name_original": "Between Planets", "description": "\"Between Planets\" is a survival-based sandbox game based on exploration. Players need to explore on the planet constantly, collect materials on the planet and build their own base to survive.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0The background of the game is that the protagonist encountered an unidentified attack on the way back to the mission. When he woke up, he found himself trapped on a planet and found that people who had experienced the same experience had been trapped here for a long time.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0You can explore on the planet, find logs that others have left on the planet, and scan to get data on the production of various items or buildings. There are land and sea on the planet, you can explore underwater, or you can find other civilized buildings on land.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0<h3>Future update:</h3>\u00a0\u00a0Because the current scene of the game is a complete planet, the map is relatively large, and there are several large oceans that have not yet been laid out. Later, the buildings and vegetation that can be explored on the planet will be slowly improved. I can promise that the game will be updated regularly after it is released. The features that can be guaranteed will be satellite systems, vehicle systems, rocket launch systems, and smarter AI. Some of these features are already in production and I believe they will be available soon. The game currently has several celestial satellites that have already been installed, but it may not be able to land on it for the time being, because the game story has not yet developed into outer space.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcd/bcd712a7105698d6b969721c8d5c402c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Between Anything"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Between Anything"], "esrb_rating": null}
