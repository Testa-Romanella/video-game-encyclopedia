You have 60 seconds to mix as many drinks as possible to a standard at which people will pay you. Don't mess up or you won't be able to pay rent haha.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Drink Mix is a university project that went for 12 weeks. For the project we had to create custom game controllers that accompany a game and the game can only be played with those controllers. This means if you download the game and don't have access to the controller, it won't be great. However it is possible to play on keyboard.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Keyboard controls:</p>\n<p>- Pickup bottles - q,w,e,r</p>\n<p>- Tilt bottle - 1,2</p>\n<p>- Serve and Reset Drinks - mouse right click and left click</p>\n\n<p>Also keep an eye on the below link. I plan to post tutorial blogs on how we made the controllers in the near future so people can potentially make their own controllers.</p>\n<p><em>(link coming soon, sorry)</em></p>\n\n<p>Meet the team:<br/></p>\n<p>Brady Johnston (@IneptConcepts) - Project Manger, Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Narisa Macleod (@narisa_macleod) - Game Designer</p>\n<p>Matthew Von Wilpert (@vonwil_m) - Game Designer</p>\n<p>Ben Houghton\u00a0(@BenJHoughton96) - Game Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c95bdb7d84f69d8cbd2e08a6cb5bd5b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brady Johnston"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
