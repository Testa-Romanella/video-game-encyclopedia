Winning will require strategy and patience, but sometimes you might use some more risky solutions !<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Inspired by <em>Daleks: The game by Isaac Sukin</em>, Dance of Epiphron is a game where you will have to move your pawn over a 15x15 checkerboard to escape the opponents pawns. You will be able to use bombs to explode them, and teleport yourself, but with a limited count of safe teleports. Each time you take an action, enemies will move toward you.</strong></p>\r\nMade in 1 week by :\r\nRobin Six \u2022 Programming, Lighting, Sound Design, 2D Art\r\nElie\u00a0Paquiet \u2022 3D Art, Environment\r\n\n<p><strong>Artstation post with the assets I made and my rendering process !</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T03:57:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d95d73bfc2dfd61f7e2d9807caec341e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robin Six - Saering", "Elie Paquiet - Talyn"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
