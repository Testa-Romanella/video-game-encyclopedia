Pretty snazzy, if I\u00a0do say so myself.</p>\n<p>Anyways.\u00a0Halloz there. This is my first solo project for the Weekly Game Jam. It was quite a week, but I had a lot of fun working on this. There's not a heck of a lot to talk about, other than the updates planned for this.\u00a0So initially I had a storyline all set and voiced. But then, shortly before I submitted this, I was staring at the theme and I was all like ZOMG\u00a0I\u00a0HAVE A GREAT IDEA FOR THE PLOT. So long story short, this is the no-narrative version of the game, which is why there isn't a proper intro, but what can I\u00a0say? A week to make a game is a bit crunchier than I'd like. XD</p>\n<p>Oh. I also completely forgot about sound like a dingus. So this is quite unfinished, but the core gameplay+visuals are all there; just the tutorial text is not properly included.</p>\n<p>If you're a Windows user, you should be able to just extract the .zip and let it rip. For Linux, you'll have to download the source archive, then follow the instructions in the README file. : )<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5c6cc04fc3e8e3b51894c710b501141.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arden Winter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
