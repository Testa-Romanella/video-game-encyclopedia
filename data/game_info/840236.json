This is my first ever game and it was ment to help me learn how to use RenPy and other things like that.\u00a0Fun learning experience for me yay! If you like the game good on\u00a0you! If you don't like it then that's fine because the game was made for my friends and I'm just publishing it here because I think it would be silly!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T13:15:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b0699e9a311c65842d89eb6fd16c5c57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Milo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
