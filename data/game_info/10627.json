The player collects gems that allow them to execute different attacks in the order of their choosing. All this results in a symphony of combos that fill the screen with blood and guts. If Riptale was a board game it would shoot scissors at you.<br/><br/>Instead of erratic hacking of the attack button the player must instead first aim at their target and then strike. The attacks are powered by arcane gems which make them powerful enough to bring down the ancient dragons threatening the world. Each gem takes a few moments to recharge, which means the attacks must be planned carefully lest they run out at the worst possible moment.Features:<br/><ul><li>CRAFT YOUR OWN COMBO</li></ul>Purchase attack gems and line them up the way you want to fight.<br/><br/><ul><li>GAMEPAD SUPPORT</li></ul>Unlock the true power in your attacks by utilizing the analogue stick.<br/><br/><ul><li>INTERESTING ENEMIES</li></ul>Encounter dragons and mystical cultists and end their reign of terror.<br/><br/><ul><li>TERRIFYING BOSSES</li></ul>Fight challenging bosses that stand in your way on the journey down.<br/><br/><ul><li>LARGE GAME AREAS</li></ul>Roam through dark crypts, underground forests, and mushroom caverns.<br/><br/><ul><li>UNLOCKABLES</li></ul>Unlock pets, scarfs, and trinkets by completing achievements and challenges.<br/><br/><ul><li>MYSTERIOUS LORE</li></ul>Piece together the history of the buried civilization by reading books.<br/><br/><ul><li>UPTEMPO SOUNDTRACK</li></ul>Paying homage to the classics of yesteryears and preparing you for the action.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be1/be18e2ec235d7fe63d162d5b4400a653.jpg", "website": "http://supergod.fi/games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 39, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Super God"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Super God"], "esrb_rating": null}
