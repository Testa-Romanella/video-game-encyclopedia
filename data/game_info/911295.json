That lovely orange cat nearby seems to want something. Better go talk to them and find out?</p>\n<p>NOTES</p>\n<p>* You can use mouse buttons for attack and using items, but the mouse itself doesn't do anything. Don't bother clicking on stuff - nothing will happen.</p>\n<p>* The pause system is still pretty buggy. Ideally don't use it if you don't have to - but if you do and it crashes, please let me know where and when!</p>\n<p>* Controller support is also slightly wonky. You'll need to use the D-pad to navigate in menus, for example.</p>\n<p>2.1 Release Notes</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Fixed a bug wherein a character froze if hit with an arrow</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Assorted balance tweaks</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Clarified one quest progression slightly</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Minor bugfixes</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Removed Herobrine</p>\n<p>Attributions</p>\n<p>All music by Kevin McLeod</p>\n<p>\"Bleeping Demo\", \"Blippy Trance\", \"Cruising for Goblins\", \"Exit the Premises\", \"Overworld\", \"Tiki Bar Mixer\", \"Townie Loop\", \"Video Dungeon Boss\"</p>\n<p>Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Art Assets</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/zelda-like-tilesets-and-sprites</p>\n<p>\"[LPC] Jungle Ruins\" by bluecarrot16.
