The residents are unable to leave their rooms, so they\u2019re relying on your help. They'll\u00a0 be so grateful if you go that extra mile for them.</p>\n<p>Using your cursor, point and click on the neighbour you wish to interact with. If you\u2019d like to give them a gift, you can simply click and drag. If you\u2019re not sure what to tackle next, have a look at your To- Do list.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Like carriages on a train, or rooms in an apartment, we can feel disjointed at times. Helping one another can help us regain closeness and reminds us that we are an entire vehicle on the same journey, and we have whole neighbourhoods within our buildings.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:04:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f86fa07f6945520f56be9d2b6de8123.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Carter Cook", "roojeez", "RichaThomas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
