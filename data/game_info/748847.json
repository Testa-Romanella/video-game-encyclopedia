It has some rough edges but since I had actual fun while play testing it might as well be publicly available.</p>\n<p>To spice things up the Paddle has a dash ability. The ball can only destroy blocks of it's own color and will randomly change color when hitting a wrong block.</p>\n<p>There are five incredibly hard levels. You only have 3 balls to finish the game\u00a0but if you make it you can create even harder challenges in the level editor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T05:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69f782113589a9f64e2289e010c640fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scancee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
