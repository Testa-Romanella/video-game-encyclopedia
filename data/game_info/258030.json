Each has different weaponry and strengths such as fuel capactiy, armour and speed.</p>\n<p>Most hostages are being held within buildings and those buildings will need to be destroyed in order to reveal the people inside (they're tough, don't worry you can't hurt them!)<br/></p>\n<p>Keep an eye on your fuel, shield and ammo levels during each mission and leave plenty of time to return to base to resupply. There's nothing worse than running out of fuel within sight of your base - and that means game over.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/9573561f36284d49c7b241fa31db3555.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["benjames171"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
