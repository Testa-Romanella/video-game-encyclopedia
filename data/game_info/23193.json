The adults are having their own adventures there. Every night, all the time.<br />\nAnd of course there is the Monster. It is always there, hiding somewhere in the shadows where the eye can\u2019t see. Adults said that the monster isn\u2019t real, that it\u2019s all just imagination. But the adults are wrong. The monster is real, although Teddy keeps telling that it isn\u2019t. He keeps telling that everything\u2019s going to be all right.<br />\nTeddy will always be there, watching Lydia. Keeping the monster away. Making sure, that Lydia can sleep through the night.<br />\nBut this time the sounds are louder than usual.<br />\nLydia is a story game in the vein of To the Moon.
