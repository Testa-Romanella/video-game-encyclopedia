Play this game in a combat style that aligns with China's Qimen Dunjia. The game contains a lot of professional knowledge about Qimen Dunjia, Feng Shui Kanyu, and making runes and symbols. Players who like magic can enjoy a feast of blessings, while horror game enthusiasts who do not understand magic can also play freely.<br/><strong>The hand decision system based on the Nine Palaces includes attack spells based on the Five Acts</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>Auxiliary Mantra adapted from Qimen Dunjia</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>In the game, some real spells have been adapted into relevant decryption games</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>There are also many unique props in the game as \"helpers\" to assist players in playing</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>Don't forget the most important Qimen Dunjia system, please look forward to the Qimen Visualization Plate at that time!</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>background story</strong><br/>Why are the classmates' eyes so strange on a peaceful and beautiful university campus? Why are there frequent homicides on campus? Is the teacher the murderer or the student the murderer or... is it human harm, ghost harm, or ghost harm? What strange story has happened in this school? At that time, please ask all the Taoists to investigate.<br/><br/>srzrhsz<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>We are a small team of two, and due to various reasons, the process of game development has been relatively slow. But we will do our best to fix every bug, and we hope that all Taoist Priests can provide more opinions. If possible, we will also adopt it as appropriate!<br/>Official QQ group\uff1a10093771", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T03:37:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdb86bc1b760bdb9d3fd91e18ff8ad55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u708e\u5e1d\u5f52\u4e61", "\u5929\u65b9\u5730\u5706\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4", "\u8046\u67ab"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5929\u65b9\u5730\u5706\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
