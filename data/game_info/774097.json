It is a small island with a single village populated by fewer than 30 people, that had a contingent of 13 border guards stationed on the island at the time of the attack. The\u00a0<em>Moskva</em>\u00a0called on the soldiers to surrender in return for their safety, which was firmly declined by the defenders.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The exchange, which took place in Russian, has been translated as:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Russian warship:</strong>\u00a0\"Snake Island, I, Russian warship, repeat the offer: put down your arms and surrender, or you will be bombed. Have you understood me? Do you copy?\"\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Ukrainian 1:</strong>\u00a0\"That's it, then.
