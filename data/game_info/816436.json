It\u2019s time to piece together your past, your life, and the world, even as it falls apart around you.\u00a0<br/><br/> <br/>As the waters recede, what will you discover? About the island, about your past, about yourself?<br/><br/> <br/>Wander further each day as you piece together what you can. This is your home\u2026 or it was\u2026 or it will be? You\u2019re not quite sure, but you\u2019re here now. And your eczema is under control. Things are looking up.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Collect strange sparkling artifacts - \u201cchunkies\u201d - left behind by the receding waters. What are they? Items of furniture? Memories of a long-forgotten time? Clues to what happened here?<br/><br/><br/>Write letters to Darl, you miss him, but you\u2019ll see him again\u2026 maybe. Will you ever send these letters? Maybe not, but it\u2019s nice to have a record.<br/><br/><br/>Gaze into the increasing number of rock pools that now scatter your domain and contemplate the vastness of life and all of creation, or just look at the rippling water and hope you see a crab \u2013 so pretty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Collect, explore, long for companionship. This is life. <br/>This is what life is.<br/><br/>~1 hour of narrative playtime.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T05:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8dad9193e915a637c8c1a8cf8caf8858.jpg", "website": "https://fuzzyg.host/qmp/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Fuzzy Ghost"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Fuzzy Ghost"], "esrb_rating": null}
