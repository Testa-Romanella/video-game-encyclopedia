{"id": 103505, "slug": "all-visitors-welcome", "name": "All Visitors Welcome", "name_original": "All Visitors Welcome", "description": "<p>Sloane Rock SHP was established in 1920 to help preserve the legacy of <br/></p>\n<p>Lazarus Sloane and his many cultural and economic contributions to the <br/>history of the state of California. A visit to Sloane Rock SHP is like <br/>taking a step back in time to the exciting days of the Gold Rush. Much <br/>of the upper acreage of the park remains just as it did back when Sloane<br/> first set eyes upon it way back in the late 1800s, so it\u2019s a good place<br/> to get a feel for our shared history as Californians. This game will <br/>help familiarize you with some of the more interesting features of the <br/>park. We hope that you enjoy your visit and leave with many happy <br/>memories.<br/></p>\n<p>Requires Quest software installation (available free from http://textadventures.co.uk/quest ) to play.</p>\n<p>Play online at http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/svfdn3ogsuwffkia1e7uhq/all-visitors-welco...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ee/5ee4bbaf51fd6d7090168f927fe8abdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bitterkarella"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
