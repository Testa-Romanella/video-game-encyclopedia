We were given three weeks to take a retro title (<em>Spy Hunter</em>) and put a modern spin on it. Of course, as it is December, we thought it'd be fun to give it a Christmas theme. It's nothing too fancy,\u00a0 but it was fun to put a seasonal twist on such a classic game. <br/><br/>We hope you enjoy our project!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/>A = Left<br/>D =\u00a0Right<br/>W = Accelerate<br/>S = Decelerate<br/>Mouse = Aim<br/>Spacebar = Fire<br/>R = Rockets<br/>T = Smoke<br/>Esc = Pause/Unpause<br/><br/><strong>FAQ:</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Q</strong>: How do I attack?<br/><strong>A</strong>: Rockets, bullets, and smoke need to be acquired through pickups before they can be used. Until then, the player can try to run the enemy off the road.<br/><br/><strong>Q</strong>: Is there a way to win?<br/><strong>A</strong>: No, the game is endless. (Feel free to post your high scores in the comments!)<br/><br/><strong>Q</strong>: I noticed a bug, should I mention it?<br/><strong>A:\u00a0</strong>As students of Game Design, we're always open to critiques. If you see something that's broken, or have any suggestions, go ahead and leave a comment! That being said, we\u00a0<em>will\u00a0</em>be starting our capstone courses next month, so we may not have time to fix bugs or implement changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:<br/><strong>Travis Dolan</strong>: Programmer<br/><strong>Gabe Estela</strong>: Asset Designer<br/><strong>Jessica Gillet</strong>: Assets and UI Design<br/><strong>Delta\u00a0Gier</strong>: Level and Sound Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e57e5806dc16b63bf089c5c51c2866e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeltaGier"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
