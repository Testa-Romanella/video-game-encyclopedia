The theme was \"Isolation\". In this game, you play as a\u00a0matriarch vampire cat who has to save her brood of vampire cat babies from the evil werewolf. In order to do that, she has to keep herself isolated from the werewolf so that he cannot see her and chase her. Save as many vampire cat babies as you can before time runs out!</p>\n<p>Since this is a submission for the AI and Games Jam, for this game, we have trained a Neural Network using Unity ML-Agents Toolkit for the behavior of the werewolves.<br/></p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Diego Jos\u00e9 Alfonso Rodr\u00edguez - Game Design &amp;\u00a02D Art\u00a0-\u00a0https://diegojarblog.wordpress.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>Laura Alm\u00f3n Manzano - Game Design &amp;\u00a0Programming -\u00a0https://lauraalmon.wordpress.com/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T11:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d8/2d8cee7d6151cdaee0ea6d01c0a78c94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["lau", "Diego Jar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
