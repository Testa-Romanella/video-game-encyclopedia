{"id": 734773, "slug": "in-the-end", "name": "In The End", "name_original": "In The End", "description": "<h3>Features:</h3><br/>Your dropped into a map, given 2 guns, which you must use to fight almost endless waves of the dead, but as you progress wave by wave, getting temporary perks dropped by zombies to help you along the way, you will start to think you have it under control... As you get higher in waves, you will notice zombies getting faster and stronger, and the weapons you started with no longer have much affect against the dead, so its time to upgrade. After you have shot, slashed, and blown your way through enough zombies, you will have built up some cash, so its time to look for the mystery crate. The crate will give you a random weapon for a cost, but remember you only have 1 minute between rounds to look for the crate, which may not be in the same location as the last match, so be quick, and don't get trapped.<br/><br/>By the time you have your desired weapons and strategy in place, it will be about time for a change of scenery, Night time. As your game progresses you will find it getting dark, which will limit your visibility, so make sure to turn on your flashlight. You may also find the weather changing, like thunderstorms and rain, which will make it almost impossible to hear the zombies, so remember to keep moving and always watch your back.<h3>More features:</h3><br/>You can toggle between third and first person.<br/><br/>Look out for orange containers placed on the map, which explode when shot.<br/><br/>As you kill zombies, watch out for dropped perks, like instant kill, ammo, health packs, and a nuke, which kills all spawned zombies.<br/><br/>Don't run out of ammo, because you will find it very difficult to melee a zombie without getting hit back, so use your grenades and the explosives placed around the map to conserve.<h3>Please refer to the \"Why Early Access?\" section for plans or goals for the game.</h3><br/><strong>Feel free to leave feedback or ideas.</strong><br/><br/>Enjoy,<br/><br/>SwizZgamesS.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T03:35:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/100/100a474f09fac6b436d6d092903247aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 355, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SwizZzle"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SwizzGamess"], "esrb_rating": null}
