The Russo-Ukraine War at Sea", "description": "<p>The land war in Ukraine is dragging on, with no sign of a cease-fire in sight.\u00a0 To restart the Ukrainian economy, it is imperative that you find a way to reopen the port of Odessa on the Black Sea.\u00a0 Currently, the Russian Navy is blocking access to the bulk freighters that could transport Ukrainian grain to markets in the Middle East and Africa.\u00a0 Commercial shipping companies will not take the risk of being hit by a Russian anti-ship missile.\u00a0 The challenge is to find a way to neutralize this anti-ship missile threat.\u00a0 You can try to destroy the Russian platforms that deliver these missiles with missiles supplied by Ukraine's NATO allies.\u00a0 You could also try and blind these radar guided missiles using powerful electromagnetic jammers mounted on old Soviet Mil-14 helicopters.\u00a0 You will also need to destroy the Russian special forces units that have retaken Snake Island.\u00a0 Finally, you have to find a way to stop Russian cruise missiles from destroying the grain storage facilities along Odessa's waterfront.\u00a0 This is a tall order because Russia has everything you lack: ships, modern combat aircraft, and submarines.\u00a0 Nevertheless, you have the tools you need to bring grain to countries on the edge of starvation.\u00a0 You just need to figure out how to use them.\u00a0 Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T10:56:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/101/1019921e84d2b651b06f95fddfb073d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["africacrossgames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
