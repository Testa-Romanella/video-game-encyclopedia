Well, for now it is, but more are on the way very soon! Each game in the I Hate Heroes collection features new, unique locomotion, inspired by superheroes. They are designed to be completed in 1-2 hours, with challenging obstacles that provide immense satisfaction when completed.  We chose this format so that we can share with you many locomotion experiences quickly.

Use them to avoid obstacles and complete the courses by skating along platforms, climbing up walls, and making daring jumps.6 Challenging CoursesDespite being trapped by the greatest villain of all time, you won\u2019t be stuck in boring or uninspired levels for hours on end.

Revisit old levels to master the mechanics and achieve new best times!TechnologyThis game was developed for the Vive and Oculus headsets.
