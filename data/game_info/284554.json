I am not a developer and I thank Bolt for giving me the opportunity to get out of my head different concept. It's a deliverance and a real pleasure to have fun with Bolt.</p>\n<p><strong>The concept:</strong><br/>The player must be literally kill time. The boss (the big white Spiderclock behind) has 86,400 health (there are 86,400 seconds in 24h) which less every second that pass. The player must destroy the little spider clocks to make the time pass faster. The small spiderclock represent 1 minutes. If you follow the color sequences given by the boss, the spiderclock is 3 minutes long. The combos multiplies the time gained. When you destroy the spiderclock heart last, it multiplies the gain by two and restores a life point.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the community for help and advice</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T03:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62d/62dba1d5918638eb812c26e5aa109f05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mouflon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
