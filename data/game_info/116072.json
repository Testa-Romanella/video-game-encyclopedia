Plan, build, craft, fight and explore the world. We do not pursue trends - Griblers is a tribute to the strategy and RPG classics!</p>\n<p><strong>\u2611 City-builder</strong><br/>Restore an abandoned town \u2013 the ruins of an ancient civilization. This may not be as big as in classic turn-by-step strategy and role-playing games like HMM or Civilization, but it\u2019s perfect for unhurried gameplay on the touchscreen :)</p>\n<p><strong>\u2611 Exploration</strong><br/>Explore the map of The Everwoods. The mountains are rich in gold and sapphires. Fertile fields provide grasses and food. Dense forests are ripe with wood and precious acorns. Scorching deserts are rich in valuable sand. Everywhere there are secrets to attract an experienced RPG adventurer...</p>\n<p><strong>\u2611 Battles</strong><br/>The local inhabitants you'll encounter are not happy with their new neighbors. To battle them, you will need weapons and magic potions. You will need to craft these in the workshop according to ancient recipes.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2611 Craft</strong><br/>Improvise to make your first simple tools, then progress to crafting more complex tools to ensure your survival in the wilds of The Everwoods.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2611 Turn based tactics</strong><br/>The game will become progressively more difficult \u2013 you will face new enemies, while the old ones remain familiar and safe. As in any RPG strategies, you'll level up your griblers through building the town. As they level up, your griblers gain new skills and improve their strengths. Don't be fooled by simple graphics \u2013 you'll find a challenge for both fans of classic role-playing games and TBS strategy classics like Heroes of Might &amp; Magic or Civilization. Very often you will have to think 10 moves ahead \u2013 stave off danger from Squashy, lead Croxy, explore the fog of war with Rusty...</p>\n<p><strong>\u2611 Random events</strong><br/>Random events make the gaming experience more diverse \u2013 you may run into a sudden treasure chest or even an old witch. If you're lucky, you might even find seven-league boots. But not everyone has this much luck...</p>\n<p><strong>\u2611 Original Setting</strong><br/>Griblers are unusual creatures, mushroom trolls, who are indigenous inhabitants of an area called The Everwoods. We did not copy tired, classic fantasy with dwarves and elves. Instead, you will plunge into a new world with unique characters, funny dialog and unusual gameplay.</p>\n<p><strong> \u2605And the most important thing...\u2605</strong></p>\n<p><strong> \u2611</strong> <strong>Classic offline strategy gameplay with no ads or p2w</strong><br/>We both are working on this game alone, so Griblers is a pet project, not aimed at getting money out of players. There is no annoying advertisement at every step or pay-to-win tactics. The gameplay is built in a way to make you enjoy the strategy game, without having to watch the same ad a hundred times for things you don\u2019t really need.</p>\n<p>Of course not everyone will like the game, as it has no vulgarity, blood, or violence. It's not an Action game. It's a TBS strategy with elements of RPG and tactics. The gameplay is not a simple copy of the PC analogues. We tried to make it comfortable to play on your smartphone or tablet. That\u2019s why we spent a lot of time designing the interface specifically for touchscreen.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our simple funny strategy. We are always ready to discuss the intricacies of the walkthrough with players, to give hints in difficult situations and are open to any suggestions on game improvement.</p>\n<p><strong> \u2605\u2605\u2605So, are you ready for an adventure?\u2605\u2605\u2605</strong><br/><em>Spring comes in The Everwoods, and griblers Croxy, Squashy, and Rusty decide to go back to their ancient homeland. Help them to defeat the enemies, restore Hardwood and bring back former glory.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fc/7fc5923d8a4391e1385a466779b82fe3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["drbrick"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
