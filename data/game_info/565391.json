It was posted to collect feedback.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to survive until the last level, making as many points as you can along the way.\u00a0\u00a0You will see the level displayed and a keyboard image will appear on top of the level to show what key to press to shoot.\u00a0You can shoot at pretty much any object on the screen. Inanimate objects hide bonuses such as points and health points. Enemies will appear as the game progresses, and you must kill them before they kill you.</p>\n<p>There's a patent pending on the \"keyboard for shooting\" idea.
