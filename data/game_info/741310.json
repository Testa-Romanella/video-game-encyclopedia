Thus, our retro-inspired dungeon crawler was born. We managed to finish confidently on time, but wow was it hard to hold back on adding a million features!</p>\n<p>This go around, one of our proudest accomplishments is the procedural dungeon generation\u00a0which scales level size, enemy difficulty, and treasure, from floor to floor. We hope players enjoy challenging themselves and trouncing their previous high scores!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All resources and assets were made by our team unless otherwise stated.</p>\n<p>- Code: Zach &amp; Kyle<br/>- Art &amp; SFX: Zach<br/>- Nokia 3310 Kontakt Patch\u00a0(check it out, it's free!)</p>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<p>- Sometimes the exit spawns really close to the player, causing the level to be instantly completed.
