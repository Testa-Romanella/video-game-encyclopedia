{"id": 968038, "slug": "behind-the-barrier", "name": "Behind The Barrier", "name_original": "Behind The Barrier", "description": "Background:<br/>\r\nIt was 666CE (the beginning of the medieval days) and some people settled in an area that they named Rosenwood. They built a town and lived in this hidden location within the forest and mountains for many years. For the next 100 years or so, they grew and expanded the barrier of the village, but one day, everything had been lost. Some evil people who had recently come to the village disguised as merchants waited until night to open a portal from hell just above the village. It was from a curse that had been set up with multiple layers as precaution that nobody would be able to break it in the future. Just as the evil merchants had panned, A demon was able to escape hell through the deathly red portal above and could roam freely throughout the village. Because of the limitations of the curse, the demon could only stay within the barriers of the village and stand in moonlight. The merchants also set up this curse to close the village gates when it turned night so that the people living within could not escape from the Demons wrath. In a single night, the demon had devoured and massacred the entire village. New stories about people who have gone to the village and never returned were told. Other stories such as hearing devil-like noises from outside the village kept people far away from that forest. Exorcists have tried many times to try and break the curse that holds the demon chained within the barriers of the town, but have failed every time because the curse can only be deactivated at night which is when the Demon is out and ready to kill. The year is 1440, and you are a priest that was brave enough to travel to the village to cleanse the evil spirit (demon) that has been lurking in the village.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat do you do?<br/>\r\nOnce you enter the village, you have to collect Celtic crosses that are spread out in random houses across the village. Using the crosses, you have to activate the trap in the middle of the village and make sure the demon gets caught in it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour on the clock: <br/>\r\nYou are on a timer so make sure you don\u2019t waste too much time looking for crosses. There are 3 runes which act as safe houses on the map and unless you reach them before the time runs out, the Demon will be on the hunt. Also make sure you enter the rune with as little time left as possible because the timer will reset with less time each rune.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat to watch out for:<br/>\r\nWhile you are on the clock and looking for Celtic Crosses, watch out for evil spirits which lurk around the middle of the town. They are attracted to the demon trap and can shorten your time if they attack you so be careful and stay moving. If you hear an evil spirit near you, you can prevent them from sensing you by moving away from the center of the village until you cannot hear them, or get to the objective.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse your runes wisely:<br/>\r\nYou only get 3 runes in a night so make sure you don't waste them by immediately going into them. The runes are marked on the screen with a diamond and can give you more time until the demon is released from it's curse again to kill you. Make sure to only go into them when you are running low on time or the demon is already on the move.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMultiplayer:<br/>\r\nDon't hype too early for this because I am in the early stages of working on this. I originally wanted this to be multiplayer, but since it is hard to incorporate by myself it may take some time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T06:03:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d84dae03f9c53f08ad0eac97bd7e93a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SinnerG"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["SinnerG"], "esrb_rating": null}
