Action.<br/><br/>Edo Superstar is an action-packed beat-em-up set in old Japan, featuring a colorful cast of animal characters. Guide Masaru, an energetic monkey with lofty ambitions to be the most popular fighter in the land, as he battles his way to Edo City and competes in the prestigious Zodiac Tournament.<br/><br/>Along the way our hero sharpens his skill and avoids his former ninja clan who hunt him for forsaking their order in his pursuit of fame.<br/><br/>Players control Masaru using a gesture-based control scheme that uses intuitive swipes and taps instead of cluttering the screen with virtual buttons. Slide under punches, uppercut massive foes in slow motion, parry incoming attacks, string together epic combos, and unlock even more abilities along the way. <br/><br/>As Masaru defeats his enemies, his fame rises allowing our hero to increase his strength, defense, speed and special stats. Money collected from bested foes can purchase special items, like stat altering amulets, giving our hero an even greater edge in combat. Performing well in a level will also yield special stars, which upgrades Masaru\u2019s equipment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T02:41:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/857/857c96dce9a5f3b9d2deed807eb14454.jpeg", "website": "http://edosuperstar.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["cleaversoft"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Cleaversoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
