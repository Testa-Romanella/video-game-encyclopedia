Tara has created an experimental therapy AI that has been suffering a series of unusual malfunctions. <br/><br/>Willow's psyche is so advanced that Tara can't tell if Willow's problems are the sign of technical issues or if they're signs of mental illness. Dr. Harold Freeman, the president of the university, is worried that Willow's sudden consciousness could have massive ethical ramifications and has been fighting with Tara to have the AI shut down. <br/><br/>Your job is to diagnose the cause of Willow's malfunction, treat it through therapy, and gain the trust of both Tara and Dr. Freeman in order to keep Willow safe and functional.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Players will have to grapple with questions about purpose, identity, how we cope with tragedy and how we treat mental illness, all while working to maintain the loyalties of many characters who all have their own agendas.
