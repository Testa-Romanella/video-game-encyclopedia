Ever since that big storm, there's this weird thing phones do, sometimes... it really works! I did it! When I picked up the phone, it was already ringing, placing a random call!

Currently small notes of the intended audio are included instead. Please come back and play the game on or after 10/4/22 for the full audio experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T22:38:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecb/ecbc9f096f0ff940533c6b2277551908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["goathouse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
