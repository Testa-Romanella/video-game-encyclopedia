Each simulation has its own host of fully customizable settings to alter its behavior and appearance, while a simple menu provides descriptions and a way to start\u00a0each simulation.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>\r\nDescription of Each Simulation\r\n<ul><li><strong>Rigidbody Physics:\u00a0</strong><em>The simplest type of physics simulation, only utilizing rigid objects and basic collisions. This simulation was made possible using\u00a0the St\u00f6rmer\u2013Verlet equation of Verlet Integration.</em></li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Gravitational SImulation:</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong><em>This simulation uses newtonian mechanics and Newton's equation for universal gravitation to depict planets and other celestial bodies. Velocity and trajectory visualizers have been added to provide a means to control the movements of the planets, even to create orbits.</em></li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cloth Simulation:\u00a0</strong><em>This simulation once again uses Verlet Integration to replicate the movement of cloth, rope, and other flexible structures. An optional automation makes it easier to generate cloth in a grid shape for precise and accurate results.</em></li></ul>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><em>Note: Since this was made as a quick and simple proof-of-concept tool, little to no polish has been added to make the simulations look or feel better.</em><br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n<p><strong>Mac:</strong> <em>Download the .zip file labeled for Mac and unzip it. Double click the .app application to run it.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Windows:\u00a0</strong><em>Download the .zip file labeled for Windows and unzip it. Open the resulting folder and double click the .exe file to run it. Make sure all the contents of the folder stay in the same directory, or the app will break.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Linux:\u00a0</strong><em>Download the .zip file labeled for Linux and unzip it. After that, I don't know, you'll have to figure it out.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T16:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0f/d0fbe3e8b1956f83bc8c7849165a847a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Spaceshark"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
