You are secretly a werewolf and you have to kill\u00a0everyone in that town, seeing them ragdoll in the air after smacking them with giant claws. You have short burst of \"Fury Mode\" where you turn into a werewolf and go berserk.\u00a0If you get caught it will make everything more challenging. If\u00a0 Civilians see you in Fury Mode\u00a0they will run away alerting any Guard that's close by. Guards have Crossbows that have pure silver arrowheads that will kill you even when in Human Mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Note! This is my very first game!
