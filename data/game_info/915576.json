I could consider this as a sequel to my BHA5 I guess, play as Marisa as she investigates a mysterious Hell - like location from the outside world, in which violent \"creatures\" await for her own blood.<br/><br/>After the strange incident that Reimu resolved, Reimu decided to slack off on incident solving. Marisa gets bored but then someone in the shrine came, it was Hecatia. And she seems that she wanted someone to investigate her matters. According to her, a said \"King Minos\" has decided to come to Gensokyo, knowing that they might always be busy judging souls. It seems odd that they just decided to get to Gensokyo. Considering that Reimu is pretty lazy now, Marisa did her time to shine. According to Hecatia, they seem to come out to some sort of mine that originally was from the outside world that leads to hell. So she asked for directions and head forth to know what's going on.<br/><br/>Credits :\u00a0<br/>Ultrakill is from\u00a0Hakita (also used music and sfx from the game)<br/>Touhou is from\u00a0Team Shanghai\u00a0Alice<br/>SFX is from ZUN<br/>Terra Shot Sheet is from\u00a0TerraformerX<br/>Fonts Used:\u00a0\u00a0<strong>VCR OSD Mono</strong>\u00a0by\u00a0Riciery Leal<br/>More music that are credited in the readme_thhsh.txt file<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/>You can edit the music by putting the music in the \"script/OST\" folder,\u00a0 and in the \"script/music.txt\"\u00a0just replace the names of the music on the \"bgmname\" list on the entry corresponding where it will play, and set up its start and end points through the \"start\" and \"end\" lists respectively</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T09:56:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/493/4936983e8e65d912767e25a93b44285d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MakutaMatara"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
