It's been awhile since I participated in a jam (June 2022, also MVM) and during that jam, near the end, the files for my project got wiped, I'm still unsure what happened, and the project didn't work after a month of me making it. For awhile, it really discouraged me in regards to game development.</p>\n<p>This time, I joined, and though I didn't quite get my game to where I wanted it, I was able to publish a working project that is (hopefully) aesthetically pleasing at the very least. I don't mind whatever place I get in this game jam, I'm simply happy to be back on my feet with dev work again.</p>\n<p>I wish everyone else who joined luck and want to thank Falcon Nova, the jam's host, for this opportunity!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music by\u00a0Chan Mrotzek</p>\n<p>Art by Lucky Clover Dev</p>\n<p>Programming by Lucky Clover Dev</p>\n<p>Lets just assume everything that isn't music was done by Lucky Clover Dev, to save space.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T18:38:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/053/053719d727ff811ba7b7639dd6a859b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucky Clover Dev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
