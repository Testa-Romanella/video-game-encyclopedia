{"id": 60530, "slug": "lucifers-forest", "name": "Lucifer's Forest", "name_original": "Lucifer's Forest", "description": "Lucifer's Forest is a first person survival horror game created in unreal engine 4. Your son runs away after a family disagreement and this forest was the last place he was seen entering. It's up to you as a father to find him and bring him home. With nothing but a flashlight and your wits, its up to you to find your way but be careful, stepping off the grass trail may prove dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt first glance this game seems nothing more than not much more than your typical slender man rip off , but under the surface is a much more exiting world a vaporwave world full of aesthetic things and activities. A computer to choose the music, a shooting range to let off aggression on a small army of angry windows 95 logos, a fantastic vaporwave soundtrack to accompany it all and to top it all off, get lost in paradise together with multiplayer! (Coming Soon). We at Elephant Dev Team love the vaporwave aesthetic and there are not many games that let you explore the aesthetic world, especially not with other players.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/756aaba34f2722ec843a0827d827e702.jpg", "website": "https://elephantdevteam.wordpress.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elephant Dev Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Elephant Dev Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
