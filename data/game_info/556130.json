Completing the puzzles takes dedication, patience, and concentration.<br/>Some say that jigsaw puzzles were invented in 1760 by John Spilsbury, a London engraver, cartographer, and publisher, when he cut a paper map into a number of small pieces of various shapes.<br/><br/>Puzzles are more than just a fun way to spend time. They also enhance your fine motor skills, help you look at problems from different perspectives, develop your imagination, your spatial reasoning, your attention span, your concentration and memory, as well as your ability to make decisions independently. All of these things are particularly important for children. Relax Puzzles offers children ages 3 and up practice with all of these skills.<br/><br/>There are plenty of ways to do puzzles online on your computer, but our mobile app lets you put together puzzles wherever you want: out with friends, on public transport, even in the woods. You can still complete our puzzles, even without an Internet connection.<br/><br/>One major upside of using a jigsaw puzzle app compared to traditional puzzles is that an app takes up much less space!
