Given a hand of works from five different artists, you must drive up the prices of your favorites while simultaneously holding back those artists&amp;#39; works to assure yourself of better prices in later rounds. <br/><br/>Can you predict the buzz?<br/><br/>Six different opponents, each with their own personality, will challenge you at a variety of levels, from EASY to HARD. Figuring out how to work with each will increase your odds of winning the game.<br/><br/>Modern Art: The Card Game is built on the same MobileEuroCard platform that RPGnet has used to release four other games by Reiner Knizia and Michael Schacht. Simple gestures, colorful animations, and evocative sounds all combine to make a great gaming experience.<br/><br/>Though we have included our first iteration of Game Center support, there is NO MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT; that is expected in a future release of the game.<br/><br/>This is the SAME GAME as MASTERS GALLERY, but it uses the artwork of modern tyros rather than classical masters. Though Modern Art: The Card Game shares a setting and general ideas with the auction tabletop release Modern Art, it is a different game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/089/0896d573c8421c94ea2c6e21e2bf5323.jpeg", "website": "http://www.skotos.net/games/strategy-board.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Skotos Tech"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Skotos Tech"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
