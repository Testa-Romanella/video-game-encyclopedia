Space Panic lacks Donkey Kong's jump mechanic and the main character instead digs holes in the platforms into which he must lure the aliens. He must then hit them to knock them out of the hole and off the screen. In later levels, two or more holes must be lined up vertically in order to dispose of the aliens. There is also a limited supply of oxygen.</p>\n<p>A ColecoVision port by CBS Electronics was released in 1983.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1980-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-23T21:48:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d9088c60db4b446941a260d19b8072e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Universal Entertainment", "Universal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Universal", "Universal Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
