Adopt a tree, water it and watch it grow. The tree grows slowly over the days, so this is a game of patience and calmness. Cut some leaves, bend some branches, strip off some bark. Especially: keep your zen. The bonsai tree is a reflection of your inner self. If all goes well, after a few days you'll have your own beautiful Bonsai.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bec/bec6b78a6e29446877a7671254e9e76b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daan Kogelmans"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
