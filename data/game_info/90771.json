{"id": 90771, "slug": "evol-pedal-walking-evolution-sim", "name": "Evol Pedal: Walking Evolution Sim", "name_original": "Evol Pedal: Walking Evolution Sim", "description": "<p>Evol Pedal is a walking evolution simulator where lifeforms reproduce based on their ability to travel forward. They evolve their own methods of walking, crawling, jumping, or climbing to adapt to the environment.<br/></p><p>\r\n\tEach movement and characteristic is programmed into their virtual genes, all of which can change over time through random mutations. Segments are connected with joints (the bold, colored lines between them), of which either stay stiff or can revolve and pivot. Each muscle has its own timers, which can also change over time, giving rise to intricate movement patterns.</p><p>\r\n\tDifferent variations will be tried until one of them passes the flag, becoming the new parent. When setting the amount of Mutations, each new lifeform will have exactly that many changes from its parent.</p><p>The simulation auto-saves/loads so you can always come back to where you left off. Every time you reset the game or create a new lifeform the game will save a backup file beforehand. For more info on this, just view the \"Info on Saving\" inside the zip. You won't ever lose your progress.<br/></p><p>New in Version 10 is a terrain option, allowing you to generate unique hills and slopes for your lifeforms to traverse.</p><p>\r\n\tUsing the Build tool, you can add steps and walls for your lifeform to \r\nget over. Setting the Round Timer will give \r\nlifeforms more or less time to pass the flag. A high round time will force your lifeform to develop and polish consistent movements to meet the higher potential distance. Power controls the strength of the muscles. The Game Speed setting is still experimental. Damping slows down the movement of the segments. Friction is set very high by default, as sliding tends to impede realistic movement. Scroll to zoom in and use the arrows keys to pan the camera. A full list of keyboard shortcuts can be found inside the zip.</p><p>\r\n\tIf Falling is on, then whenever the head of the lifeform (the white square) falls to the floor or touches a build object, if it is past its green starting line, immediately loses and its flag progress is reset. This is useful because it forces lifeforms to evolve with consideration for supporting their head, which helps to produce more life-resembling structure. Max Fails is a settings that gives the lifeform X amount of fails to pass the flag. If it runs out of tries, then the flag will be moved back one pixel and the counter will be reset.</p><p>If you like this game, share it so others can enjoy it too!<br/></p><p>| Contact | Evol Games<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc4/cc41e168aac0689a03eeca98c18e0202.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Evol Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
