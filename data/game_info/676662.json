I learnt a little more about casting and procedural animations whilst making this project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T14:16:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94b632b83db7b481c01c830bd2bbcdee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BaronNobody"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
