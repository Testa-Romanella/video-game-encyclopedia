Jade Lomax (ink-splotch / dirgewithoutmusic), the writer who brought you </em>Beanstalk<em>, </em><em>Second Star to the Left podcast</em><em>, and </em>Stay?<em>.</em></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Return to your sleepy, strange little hometown after years away. Explore your old haunts, reconnect with old friends and new, and dig into the mysteries that rise up in the town like mist.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It's a story about leaving home and coming home; about life after death-- in more ways than one. This choose-your-own-adventure game lets you explore who you <em>used</em> to be so that you can decide who you <em>want</em> to be.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>What is <em>More a Haunting than a History?</em></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>A LGBTQ-friendly dating sim wrapped up in a weird little town with weirder denizens. (Including polyam &amp; aroace relationship options)\r\n</li><li>An interactive fiction story about memory, responsibility, and identity; about understanding the past in order to decide the future. \r\n</li><li><em>OXENFREE</em> mashed up with a <em>Teen Wolf </em>fanfic, or maybe if <em>Charmed</em> had a baby with <em>Gone Home</em>? \r\n</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><em>HOW TO PLAY:\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Select \"Run Game\" or \"Load Game.\" Read the text that appears like it's a story unfolding, and select between the bolded options offered to you.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>It is recommended to use the Chrome browser</strong> for this game; other browsers tend to drop your progress if you leave the webpage for too long, especially on mobile, even if you've saved.</p>\n<p><em>HOW TO SAVE:\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Use the SAVE button to preserve your progress as you explore your hometown.\u00a0Any refresh/reload of the web page will clear your existing progress. Many phones will automatically drop any idling webpages, so save before you leave the browser app to go to another application or tab.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em>TROUBLESHOOTING:\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>If the game \"freezes,\" choices stop appearing, or it has other issues in execution, we suggest closing the browser, then reopening it &amp; reloading your most recent save. (<strong>Do NOT save at the place the error occurs.</strong> Only use a save that already existed.) This has helped with most the commonly seen bugs.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If the game won't load at all (\"Run Game\" does not appear), try deleting your cookies.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Made using inkle's INK -\u00a0inklestudios.com\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>Written by E.
