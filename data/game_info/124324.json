If you want, you can create or edit your own configuration files, everything should be understandable, except when creating a symmetrical hull the first two points need to be along the right-hand side, as this is where the hull is mirrored.</p><p>If you do create new configs, please tweet me @evglabs so I can see! </p><p>And please let me know what you think!</p><p><strong>UPDATE: (v2) </strong><strong>Base hull shapes are also now fully-generated! So you can have custom hand-made hull shapes or computer-generated hull shapes.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ce/3ceba3fba6bba4700a9d8b149af9cbaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["evgLabs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
