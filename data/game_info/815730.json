{"id": 815730, "slug": "find-the-target-shift-nine", "name": "Find The Target (Shift Nine)", "name_original": "Find The Target (Shift Nine)", "description": "<p>Find The Target is a game about a guy who just moved into a city and needs a tool for his house.\u00a0 He knows that Target supplies his tool but the thing is, he doesn't know where the Target is! Your job is to control his car to get to the Target. There may be more than one way to get to the Target, but if you don't follow the path on your map you will crash. It is very important to be careful while driving because this car never stops. Good luck and if you want to play another map there are four of them available. Just click the play button and it will randomly give you one of the four.</p>\n\n<p>I made the music in Bosca Ceoil in like 15 minutes\u00a0\u00a0and I'm not the biggest fan, but I think I would like to make the music again with more time and a better software. So stay tuned for that if you care.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T08:02:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/982652c2e043d5116c8f6b5d6ba5feaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shift Nine"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
