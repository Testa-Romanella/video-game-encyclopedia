This time I made a tiny uncomfortable experience about anxiety and nightmares.</p>\n<p>\"Adam works in a busy office at the center of a big city. He suffers from anxiety and stress in times of\u00a0 hard work. At night he dreams about wandering in his house, and every 10 seconds a particular event occurs.</p>\n<p>Can Adam explore his dream fully before the external events wake him up?\"</p>\n<p>You can use the WASD or Arrow to move Adam and Space for action. (I included a partial support for Joystick)</p>\n<p>After the dream bar is filled up, you will wake up. Do the actions and explore the dream!</p>\n<p>Some things to add:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>you can interact with some furniture.\r\n</li><li>doors, alarm clocks, telephones can silence the rings</li></ul>\n\n<p>Enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Assets by LimeZu (https://limezu.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Font by jeti (https://fontenddev.com/fonts/enter-command/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T18:46:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bc/3bc9b3a608ff683301082d929435b293.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["turegrappa"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
