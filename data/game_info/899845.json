You can get the full game here!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Netghost</strong>  is a Crime Drama visual novel with  a mystery-driven story full of  intrigue, twists and turns. The story  follows Ian Newfield, a reputable  cyber security engineer who transforms  into a cold-blooded criminal in  his struggle to protect the company he  works for and provide aid to  his ailing, bedridden sister.    </p>\n<p>Taking inspiration from both Japanese and Western media, we strived to combine the best of both worlds in the creation of <strong>Netghost</strong>   and also lay a foundation for its own identity. It offers a branching   storyline with several paths and endings and the ability for the player   to change the course of the story by using the in-game email feature. \r\n    <em>\n</em><em> <br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>Ian Newfield</strong> is a talented grey-hat hacker who works as a high-ranking cyber security engineer at <strong>Daikon Industries</strong>,   an Information Technology company that is part of a shadowy branch of a   larger conglomerate of corporations. His job is to type in the letters   and numbers that make up the encryption for top-secret software his   company is hired to guard, details of which he knows nothing about.      </p>\n<p>Ian basks in a frail sense of financial security - that is, until he   is told by his boss that their product was cracked and posted   anonymously online. Now, Ian is tasked with finding the leaker among his   peers by using any method at his disposal, in a workplace where  anyone,  from his fellow coders to the janitor of the building, could be  the  perpetrator...      </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ian's sister, <strong>Vivie</strong>,  is confined  to a hospital bed for years now, ill from a bone-wasting  disease, and  Ian works overtime to cover all her expenses and keep her  happy. Despite  his generous salary at Daikon, their situation has them  living from  paycheck to paycheck, and their objective of going for an  expensive,  experimental treatment for Vivie seems way out of reach.      </p>\n<p>With Ian's earnest effort to uncover the elusive Daikon leaker, his   life and career begin to converge with the criminal underworld of <strong>Tri-State City</strong>.   As fate would have it, opportunities rise for Ian to cut corners and   make big money, money that could, perhaps, help find a cure for his   sister. An age-old question is brought forth:\u00a0  \r\n<br/></p>\n<em>\n<p><strong><em>Does crime pay?</em></strong>\n<br/><br/></p>\n</em><p><em><em>Demo Length: Around 20.000 words</em><br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T16:48:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bb/3bb06668d0b43c238c868c99877098ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dragonfire Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
