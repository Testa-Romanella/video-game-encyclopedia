Some secondary objectives and achievements require its use, but there are manuals placed around the levels that gradually introduce how do it.<br/><br/>Also, some of the levels offer multiple paths to solve them, being able to choose a more action oriented approach or a stealthy one, and include some achievements related to this (Path of Fists, Path of Shadows...).<h3>High Entropy</h3><br/>Hopefully, High Entropy: Challenges is a fun stand-alone gaming experience by itself, but it was also made to serve as a way for people to help me test my ideas out and see if creating High Entropy --the extended, commercial version I have in mind-- is viable and something people would enjoy (it would include this challenges mode and an exclusive story mode).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T09:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a86/a866b0d2dbb500c93cf7ceaa0fa0baaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda"], "esrb_rating": null}
