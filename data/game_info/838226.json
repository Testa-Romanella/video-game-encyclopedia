The game was done in roughly 1 day and I did not have time to fix every bug and balance the game properly, but it should be playable. Playing the game in full screen (usually on wider screens than 1080p)\u00a0can cause a visual bug which makes the cursor not line up properly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another bug found after the jam ended. If you chose the power up which makes the enemies cost less, the UI will update but the prices can stay the same which makes you unable to put all enemies on the board. If this happens just restart the game (sorry!).\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Self-Sabotage is a 1-bit rouge-like \u201dpuzzle\u201d game where you collaborate with the AI and sabotaging for yourself at the same time by placing them inside a dungeon and giving them power ups. Leveling up also sabotages your chances of clearing the dungeon by allowing the AI to become stronger.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game has two modes; build mode and play mode. \r\n  </p>\n<p>In build mode you place different enemies at any location inside the dungeon. Each enemy has different stats that are shown if you hover over them. In build mode you can change between 4 stages and place enemies in each stage. You can change the stage by pressing B or N (back or next) or by pressing the buttons \u201dprev. room\u201d and \u201dnext room\u201d. <strong>Tip: Do not place every enemy in the same room. This will make the game much harder. Try to spread them out as much as possible.</strong></p>\n<p>To enter play mode you need to spend all your coins before starting the game and by pressing the play button or \u201dP\u201d. In play mode you will fight the enemies you collaborated with and eliminating all enemies in a stage will trigger an event that will take you to the next stage. After all enemies are dead in each stage you will be returned to the build mode in a new dungeon. In the new dungeon you will receive more coins to spend. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Killing enemies grants you exp. You will level up when you have enough exp and then you can chose a powerup for yourself but you will also help the enemies by giving them a power up. \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>You move with WASD\r\n  </p>\n<p>Shoot with left click\r\n  </p>\n<p>Build with left click\r\n  </p>\n<p>Pan camera with right click (build mode only)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Zoom in and out with scroll wheel (build mode only)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:01:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e99/e99fbd83cfd562e615a0d61f3ce7f751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["botstarai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
