As a result, I thought it'd be nice to include the first 1,000 subs as characters in a videogame! And then... I think... horribly murder them in space?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Might not have thought this through, to be honest.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to check the channel out, you can find me here where I'll ramble on about game design analysis, while also developing a game to release on Steam. Hope to see you there!</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:\u00a0</strong>Due to the engine I use for development (Clickteam Fusion 2.5+), some antivirus programs are reporting false positives in the exported .exe files. This is a known bug, as can be viewed on the engine's Steam discussions here. I give you my word that the file is 100% safe, because I wouldn't have much of a future making games if it wasn't.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game has been made with publicly available assets under Creative Commons licenses, listed here:</p>\n<p><strong>MUSIC ATTRIBUTIONS:</strong><br/><strong>Lights Out</strong> by Joshua McLean<br/>Link: https://joshua-mclean.itch.io/free-music-pack-5<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p><strong>ART ATTRIBUTIONS:</strong><br/><strong>Space Base Platform Shooter 8-Bit Art Graphics Pack</strong>, by Sitebender<br/>Link: https://sitebender.itch.io/space-base-platform-shooter-8-bit-art-graphics-pack<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p><strong>Will's Pixel Explosions</strong>, by Will Tice<br/>Link: https://untiedgames.itch.io/five-free-pixel-explosions<br/>License: http://untiedgames.com/files/license.txt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T07:28:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c67/c6714eb9a84b11ac2aa8618d106912c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Let's Talk Game Design"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
