{"id": 841598, "slug": "thaolundra-multiplayer", "name": "Thaolundra Multiplayer", "name_original": "Thaolundra Multiplayer", "description": "<p>This is a Unreal Engine 5 Blueprint 3D game Project using  both Advanced Locomotion System v4 and Dynamic Combat System from the  Epic Marketplace. The objective is to create a game prototype mainly  capable of multiplayer PvP matches. The project is managed by Enio  Fortes and directed by Aoshi Kearun. Aoshi is also the only programmer  so far and coding using mainly the UE5 blueprint system. We also have  two very talented concept artists Tiago \"Mushi\" Monteiro and Thais  Campos, and the musical composer and performer Luis \"Chico\" Gomes as  well. This team also was concepted to act as a creative assembly,  equally voiced in the creative decisions made for the project. The  project is yet not funded, but it aims to create a crowdfunding campaign  as soon as the main test phase ends.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n1. What is Thaolundra?\r\n<p>It is a scenario for TTRPG d100 system adapted from  Runequest created by Aoshi Kearun. The scenario consist in a planet  called Thaolundra with a variety of elementally and technologically  powered individuals, landscapes and dungeons. A story played by dozens  of players for almost 22 years. You can learn more and even play a  session accessing the link Thaolundra TTRPG.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n2. The Game\r\n<p>The game will initially consist in a multi-objective RPG  arena where you can choose atributes, weapons and a elemental power  source for your techniques, while battling in a total of 4 levels. The  goal is to translate the multifaceted combat together with the immersive  sense of exploration to the videogame medium through - initially - fast  paced and customizable combat experience and later with story-driven  campaigns.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n3. Content\r\n<p>As for now the team is not nearly enough to make a  full-fledged game, so we are taking our time with the development and  dividing our content creation into bits we can actually finish. For now,  all 3D content: static and skeleton meshes, animations, etc; are  pre-made and from the epic marketplace, but we do intend to make some of  them our own in the future. For the hour we are dividing our content in  the following categories.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\na.
