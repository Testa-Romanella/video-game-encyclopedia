Join this odd pairing on their search for answers, using the differences in their size as an advantage.<br/><br/>Quintus and the Absent Truth is a horror-themed adventure told in first-person perspective. Puzzles that Alan and Quintus encounter often require you to work out which character to use for the task at hand. Do you need Alan\u2019s height to reach buttons, switches and items that are out of Quintus\u2019 reach, or is a hole simply too tight for Alan to fit through? Only by working together can they discover the truth that they seek.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T05:02:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d4ce6451eea003455dee7ec8d228cc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
