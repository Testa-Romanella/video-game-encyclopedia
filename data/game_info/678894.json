Most of the time he is running around, climbing trees and eating food. Today Puschel is very hungry, but there is no food left! He got attacked and robbed by the two headed squirrel recently. This little mutant-bastard stole all his nuts! Someday Puschel will grab his favorite golf club and \"visit\" that sinful squirrel in\u00a0 Seattle...</p>\n<p>Anyway... Help Puschel collecting some food. This sounds easier than it is, because he lives in a magic forrest! There are giant Ants, colossal Trees. Maybe this is because of the nuclear tests nearby, but let\u00b4s call it magic.</p>\n<p>The fluffy features are:</p>\n<ul><li>9 creepy levels</li><li>3 different locations (forrest, tree and cave)</li><li>the cutest squirrel you\u00b4ve ever seen</li><li>flying acorns</li><li>killer ants</li><li>the biggest tree you can imagine</li><li>pixels, sharp as a razorblade</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T05:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6d49da7fa0e566d74e7b6b0a68d5881.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelPoldi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
