This shuddersome, mothlike infestation is drawn to the conflicts of the forest's inhabitants. Through observation and by using the abilities of nurturing and withering fascinating plants the player can solve said conflicts. NIVA's scenic art style, relaxing music and simple but intriguing game mechanics invite to explore the forest and have a rest from the stressful everyday life.\r\n</p><p><strong>A controller is strongly recommended to play.</strong><br/></p><p>For news, giveaways and other goodies follow us on <strong>facebook</strong> or <strong>Twitter</strong>.</p><p>\n</p>Installation instructions<p>Unzip the folder anywhere you like, start NIVA.exe (on Windows) or NIVA.app (on Mac).</p>Recommended minimum system requirements<p>Windows 7/8/10 (64-bit OS required) or Mac OS X 10, 3 GB RAM, graphics card equivalent to ATI Radeon 5570 or NVIDIA GeForce 430 GT with 1 GB memory, approx. 1,5 GB HDD space</p>CONTROLS<p>\r\n\tWe strongly recommend using a gamepad (Xbox 360/One Controller or PS 3/4 Controller) to play NIVA.</p>Controls with gamepad<p>\r\n\tMenu navigation: left stick and A / cross<br/>\r\n\tPause Menu: Start<br/>\r\n\tMovement: left stick<br/>\r\n\tCamera: right stick<br/>\r\n\tJump: A / cross<br/>\r\n\tPositive aura: RT / R2<br/>\r\n\tNegative aura: LT / L2<br/>\r\n\tReset Camera: RB / R1\r\n</p>Controls with keyboard and mouse<p>\r\n\tMenu navigation: mouse<br/>\r\n\tPause Menu: esc<br/>\r\n\tMovement: W A S D<br/>\r\n\tCamera: mouse<br/>\r\n\tJump: space<br/>\r\n\tPositive aura: left mouse button<br/>\r\n\tNegative aura: right mouse button<br/>\r\n\tReset Camera: Q\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p>CONTACT<p>\r\n\tNIVA is a student project that was developed at University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg, Austria.
