At this stage you can only pick stuff up and fly (as well as uselessly shoot and spawn a decoy of yourself), with a blue zone that prevents you from picking things up and a green zone that drastically hinders your ability to fly. Can you grab the macguffin and make it to the macguffin machine at the end?? Probably, the puzzles are exceptionally easy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T04:52:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65d7ab5b7b7edcb2c7fee250bf4e6eb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FasterThanAnarchy"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
