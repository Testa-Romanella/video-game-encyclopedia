It was a lot of fun and a great experience. With this game we have won the first place. Awesome!</p>\n<p>This game is\u00a0about someone who has lost his memory and tries to find his way back through the evolution of a game. You need to find and collect all the lost pictures to advance to the next level.</p>\n<p>Please take your time and give some\u00a0feedback in the comments. This will help to improve my future games.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>Philipp a.k.a.
