At this point, the technological advancements allowed people to augment their bodies and enter virtual reality. Most importantly, the robotic assistants called ROMs became increasingly popular and largely replaced the regular phones. The main producer of the robots is a corporation called Parallax, and it plans to create a new kind of fully independent AI. There&#39;s a rebel party called Human Revolution that aims to stop the progress of the AI.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The main engineer of Parallax, Hayden Webber, recently was abducted. The main protagonist is a journalist who researches the Webber&#39;s disappearance. He or she is accompanied by Turing, a highly advanced robotic assistant. They go on a search in the fictional city of Neo-San Francisco on the eve of Christmas.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>2064: Read Only Memories works as a point-and-click adventure game with a static first-person view. The environment and characters are presented to the player as slightly animated images. He or she can interact with them by clicking and choosing options, such as to look at, to take, or to speak to. </p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game is made in the vein of the 1980s and 1990s graphic adventure games. It uses pixel art visual style with minimal animation and neon-lighted environments, accompanied by a synthwave music score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-27T11:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02c/02c492df578b8eedbde3e4379f9f536a.jpg", "website": "http://readonlymemori.es", "rating": 3.19, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 186, "owned": 1269, "beaten": 41, "toplay": 25, "dropped": 54, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 293, "ratings_count": 135, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 138, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["charblar", "MidBoss", "Kossio", "JJSignal"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["MidBoss"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
