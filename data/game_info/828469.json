She lived a modest, but peaceful lifestyle. However, one day, her father- her only family- had suddenly disappeared.</p>\n<p>&quot;Go to Kaikyuu Academy.&quot;<br />\n- That was all what was written on the mysterious letter left behind by him.</p>\n<p>The private Kaikyuu Academy... A prestigious boarding school attended by sons and daughters from privileged families, founded upon the goal of educating them well in order to give them the tools to support future Japan.</p>\n<p>Following the letter left by her father, Neri transferred into Kaikyuu Academy, a school where celebrities gather. It is extremely luxurious, however, being grounded upon a social caste system, the academy is dominated by &quot;social class discrimination&quot;.</p>\n<p>At the very top of the social hierarchy is the &quot;Queen&quot;, endowed with incredible political influence, she rules over the students. Superior to everyone else but the Queen are the chosen elites belonging to the privileged class, &quot;The Roses in Full Bloom&quot;. The commoner class in which most of the students belong in, &quot;The Nameless Honeybees&quot;. &quot;The Ignored Stones&quot;... Even though they&#39;re fellow students, those in The Ignored Stones are regarded as having the same rights as a servant- they&#39;re oppressed and enslaved. Finally, there is &quot;The Resistance&quot;, which is an organisation composed of students who oppose the social hierarchy system.</p>\n<p>In a society far more disparate than she had ever imagined, Neri finds &quot;love&quot;, and gradually, a certain &quot;truth&quot; about the academy surfaces.
