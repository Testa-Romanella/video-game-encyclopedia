Shooting happens automatically, control the direction of the weapon with the mouse. Walk over loot boxes to get items. Equippable items can be used with the 1, 2, 3, or 4 keys depending on the slot they\u2019re in. As you kill enemies, you\u2019ll acquire XP to level up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T11:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f23da793ffe577061610af297eb0e069.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Udo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
