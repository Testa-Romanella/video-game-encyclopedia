You don't exactly look like you're from the Isle of Vahana. You wanna get home? To do that, you need to get to the Alter of Departure. One small problem though. It's blocked off by a magical barrier. To break it, you need to find the three magic crystals scattered throughout the island. Good luck!\"</p>\n<p>Here I've created a small outdoor level I call the Isle of Vahana! I've populated it with my own objects, along with a few from the Unity Asset Store, and textured it using both my textures and some from textures.com. Hope you like it!</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Wizardtorium by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4639-wizardtorium</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T10:48:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85da11287342058de9762681ba84b39a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["liliasay"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
