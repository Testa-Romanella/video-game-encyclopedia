On the left you will find your instructions for the code and on the right are your coding blocks. There are a total of 5 puzzles, how you achieve the outcome is completely up to you.\u00a0However due to time constrains I wasn't able to code the while block. </p>\n<p>Once you click on simulate the game will simulate the code you have constructed, to see if it produces the desired outcome. Making it actually simulate the code was a giant pain, put I think it was better then checking for each possible solution for each puzzle. Also if you make a mistake, an\u00a0exclamation mark will appear on that row.</p>\n<p>Numbers can be stored in the number block, while booleans (true/false) can be stored in the boolean block. The blocks with constant in the name are hard coded, meaning their values can't change during simulation. If the statement behind the if block is true the row below it is executed, if false this row will be skipped.</p>\n<p><em>Total development time: 16 hours</em> <em>of torture</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T03:18:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36f/36f168d1253795e634dd3b3215affb82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mika la Grand"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
