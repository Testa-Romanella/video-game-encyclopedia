Billionaire reptilian satanists G. Sorrows\u00a0and\u00a0M. Cuckerberg\u00a0are president and vice-president of the USA. A strict communist regime is immediately implemented, resulting in millions of deaths, the collapse of the global economy and the end of free speech. The constitution is ripped to shreds and replaced\u00a0with the\u00a0decree of 74853769 genders.\u00a0<br/><br/>With a global New World Order firmly in power and the worldwide population suppressed, Comrade G. Sorrows implements the\u00a0Final Solution. All straight males are rounded up and sent to death camps. A few manage to escape to the neighbouring wildernesses and mountains, only to be tracked down and slaughtered. The sight of what humanity has become brings tears to J.C's eyes. He offers the NWO a chance to repent. Unsurprisingly, they resist and attempt to crucify him. In a deadly shootout,\u00a0J.C\u00a0barely manages to escape with his life. <br/><br/>With a peaceful negotiation out of the question,\u00a0J.C\u00a0has no choice but to act fast. He cannot idly watch his people suffer. He must team up with the last remaining straight males \u2013\u00a0Tromp, Dolph, Pootin, Napolion, Mussolino, Bolselnoro\u00a0\u2013 and free the people. They must defeat the New World Order leaders and then finally upload\u00a0Facts and Logic\u00a0to the\u00a0system\u00a0\u2013 freeing the people from the social media matrix and ultimately the grasp of the tyrannical NWO.<br/><br/><ul><li>Features 7 playable characters (+ 10 additional bonus characters) each with their own unlockable outfits<br/></li><li>8 Campaign missions + 2 survival maps<br/></li><li>Over 40 unlockable weapons<br/></li><li>A variety of different enemy types and 8 unique bosses<br/></li><li>A long list of cheat codes to spice up the game play<br/></li><li>Steam achievements <br/></li><li>Satirical political and adult humour</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T16:28:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/577/577f86c3045fbe4d430a2282c59db96a.jpg", "website": "https://www.2gen.pro/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 451, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2GenPro"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2GenPro"], "esrb_rating": null}
