It comes in nice colorful style and with new features and awesome music.</p>\r\nWhat are those features?\r\n<p>Basic enemies are two types of meteors and Kamikaze UFO.</p>\n<strong>Brown Meteor </strong>- Needs just one hit to be destroyed.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        <strong>Grey Meteor </strong>- Needs two hits to be destroyed.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        <strong>Kamikaze UFO (\u795e\u98a8UFO) </strong> - Needs two hits to be destroyed and its speed is much faster. When laser blasted down or destroyed by green or red shield then casts huge explosion (see Bomb).\r\n    \r\n\r\n<p>When a meteor is destroyed, it randomly spawns not only its fragments, but also a various kinds of items that player can shoot as well to get more score points and some perks:</p>\n<strong>Bomb </strong>- Casts huge pulse explosion that destroys everything too close. Player can get some damage too!\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        <strong>Blue (Player) Shield*</strong> - Creates a shield around player providing temporary protection against all impacts (I'm invincible!). More rare than other kinds of shields.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        <strong>Red (Distance) Shield*</strong> - For a limited time creates a smaller shield at the position where item has been hit.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        <strong>Green (Moving) Shield*</strong> - Creates a small moving shield that fly around in random direction and destroys everything that touches except the player until it lefts the screen. Moving speed could be rapidly accelerated by a bomb pulse (see Bomb).\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        <strong>Red Pill</strong> - Restores health by 25 points.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        <strong>Medikit</strong> - Restores health by 50 points.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        <strong>Rare Meteor Fragments (4 color types)</strong> - Add score bonus based on its color.\r\n    \r\n\r\n<p><em>*) When a shield touches another shield both are immediately destroyed.</em></p>\n<p>Laser Asteroids allows you to <strong>set the speed of rotation</strong> (= sensitivity of accelerometer on Android version), <strong>music, sfx and ship's computer voice volume interdependently</strong> and pick one of the <strong>four difficulty levels.</strong></p>\n<p>Bigger difficulty means bigger damage range, slightly faster meteors spawning but also more score points.</p>\n<p>Each difficulty level has it's own high score holder. </p>\r\nJuicy soundtrack by Nik\r\n<p>Nik who's been making juicy music for the game recently released all three tracks at SoundCloud. Do you like it? I do.</p>\r\n\r\nWhat's the difference between PC version and Android version?\r\n<p>While PC is played with keyboard (left and right arrows + space key) in Android version an <strong>accelerometer*</strong> is used to rotate ship and you can shoot by a single tap anywhere on your display, <strong>which is more fun and gives you ability to shoot faster using two fingers</strong>. When you die you can also get one extra life by watching an ad (+50 health and blue shield if you don't skip). You can do this only once = one ad per game session.</p>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All those cool sprites are made by Kenney.nl</p>\n<p>Awesome music has been composed especially for this game by Nik</p>\n<p>Great sound effects by \r\nyd, \r\nLamoot, \r\nbart, \r\nJoth, \r\ncmusounddesign, \r\nZander Noriega and \r\nqubodup</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1c/c1c043621ea35cf18e9f1ee7e95b4698.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Marian Pek\u00e1r"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
