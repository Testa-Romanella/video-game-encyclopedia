Every purchase of in game items is done by the coins you collect during gameplay, there's no need to spend any real money, in fact, the game does not even have any purchasable content. no ads either.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:19:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65b/65bf66e422a17a79adfc0f2bd87a103e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Amit2286658"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
