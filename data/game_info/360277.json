Please proceed in an orderly fashion to higher ground and I'm sure we'll all get through this alright okay you've already started tackling and yanking each other in an undignified melee. Brilliant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*****************************************************</p>\n<p><strong>Only Port In a Storm </strong>is a two player competitive platformer where two players try to muscle their way to the high ground without falling into the rising waters. Players can tackle - a short dash forward that knocks opponents away - and yank - a move that pulls an opponent behind you and pushes you forward - in the mad scramble for the top. Be careful not to fall into the water, and remember; there's room for only one at the top!</p>\n<p>Created as a part of the GMTK Game Jam 2019<br/></p>\n<p>Programmer: JoeFrangles<br/>Artist: Qwertystop<br/>Credits: The writing system used for the design of the terrain and water, \"Dscript\", was designed by Matthew DeBlock (https://www.dscript.ca/) and released by him under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p>\n<p>Designer notes: One of the chief inspirations for this game was the song <em>Only One King</em>, which popped into my head immediately on hearing the theme for this jam.</p>\n<p><em>'Cause there's only one king<br/>And there's only one crown<br/>And there ain't enough room for us both on the throne<br/>It's about to go down</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T17:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d0/1d029fbea62b03e0858cc7b30d8883de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JoeFrangles"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
