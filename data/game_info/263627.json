One player takes the role as the evil cat villain trying to take over the world, while others are secret agents competing against each other to stop the villain, and to become the world\u2019s greatest secret agent.\n \nEach level is filled with deadly traps such as flamethrowers, saws, lava, laser cannons and much more - all controlled by the villain. But beware! The villain isn\u2019t your only enemy. The other agents will sabotage for you so they can safely pass. When the agents have made it through the villains lair they face the villain in an epic boss fight. Whoever plays the villain will control the boss in a retro style boss encounter. The agents need to cooperate to defeat the boss, but even here they can betray each other to make sure they steal all the glory.\n \nAfter each world is cleared the game, will select a new villain. When all players have played the villain once, you will know which one of you is the best agent. At least until the next game\u2026\n\nIf you are looking for a fun party game for 3 to 4 players make sure to try it out! We hope you have as much fun playing it, as we had making it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T18:31:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cee/cee1031f1a5478ecc4030ba3f976c396.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Tiltspot.tv"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
