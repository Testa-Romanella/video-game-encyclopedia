(Tested with a Steam Controller, I have not tested others)</li></ul>\r\nKnown Issues/Things I'd've Liked to Get to\r\n<ul><li>When colliding with objects such as lampposts or the sidewalk, the car still moves around. I'd've liked to figure out how to clamp it correctly, but having a little physics was too entertaining.</li><li>Didn't think of this til <em>way</em> too late, but my waypoint system for the vehicle is <em>super</em> bad. I'm making the camera follow it, when I should've made the <em>vehicle</em> follow it. So, my bad. That makes this even more uncontrollable than it probably should be (Hey, at least it fits the theme?)</li><li>The car doesn't play audio.</li><li>The trees look... bad. Figuring out how shaders and lighting weren't working with them took too much time, so I just gave up on that part.</li><li>I'd like a larger, more varied track. Maybe I'll work on that in future.</li><li>The other cars should move! That was one of the original ideas for the game, and I just never got to implement it (Turns out AI is <em>a little</em> complicated...)</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p>\n<p>\"Hot Pursuit\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p><strong>Art</strong><br/>All art by Broken Vector<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/12124</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T04:57:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/986/98631b8e81c36f882f6210de7d3c35c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Cliff Jameston"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
