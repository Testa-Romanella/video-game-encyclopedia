Having recovered their white cat backpack, our feline friend sets off on a journey to retrieve their lost batteries and find their way back to the rocket.<br/>We start off in a coastal area, where our protagonist collects a shell or two along their way. Then they find a tram station that's caught up in a bit of trouble. Once everything's been put back in order, it's a short tram trip to the mountain path on the other side of the island!<br/>Here lies a new town: Archipelago. Our kitty pal will have to lend a paw to the locals, who need to get their ceremony back on track. The next stop is the Snowy Peaks where that rocket's located\u2014if our furry friend can make it through the wondrous paths that lead there, that is.<br/>Wading through thick snow is a right pain in the tail.
