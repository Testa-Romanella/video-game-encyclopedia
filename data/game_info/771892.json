Control the spaceship using either  the arrow keys or the \"WASD\" keys on the keyboard, shoot laser beams to  destroy the asteroids using either the left mouse button or the \"Left  Ctrl\" key on the keyboard. Each time an asteroid hits the Earth, it  loses some health, and the game is over when the health is down to zero.  The final score is the time the player survived.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T08:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc3/bc314cf4bec5ae63982dedede85262c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["unnamed-catalyst"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
