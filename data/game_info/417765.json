In this game you will shoot shadow slugs to try and save your light! Get hit three times and you're out! Good luck getting new high scores!</p>\n<p>(Note restart the game every time as there is a bug that makes it so that the enemy spawners are not reset. This may make it very difficult to play. I will be updating this game throughout the week fixing this issue. It is still playable if you don't restart but can become very challenging)</p>\n<p>Upcoming Updates:</p>\n<p>- Light Bar (When you miss an enemy your light bar decreases) adds more challenge to the game</p>\n<p>- Bug Fixes</p>\n<p>- (Maybe) A level system</p>\n<p>-Options Menu being functional</p>\n<p>Hello, my name is Michael and I am a brand new game developer!
