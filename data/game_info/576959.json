And what better way to make it light-hearted than through vegetable characters!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I started learning how to make games during lockdown. I'd been playing text adventure games and games I've played on itch and decided to\u00a0make my own using Twine.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>I was undoubtedly inspired by Space Frog -\u00a0https://npckc.itch.io/space-frog\u00a0- when making The Working Onion.
