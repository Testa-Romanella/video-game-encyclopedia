You move left and right with A and D, and use space for shooting. In between waves you can build structures, just select them and press left click to place them, right click to cancel placement. Towers and walls can both be selected and upgraded, and all structures in the game can be repaired in between waves if damaged.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, this isn't really obvious, but mermaids heal all other enemies as long as it is alive.</p>\n<p>And, that's about it for controls. This is the first time I've joined a game jam (this is a subbmission for the \"I Can't Draw But Want To Make A Game (Again)\" game jam), and sadly I didn't leave myself enough time to implement everything I wanted, but still I'm pretty happy with what I've achieved. I've been thinking of making a bigger game like this, with an entirely different theme, and a lot more complexity in the buildings you can build, upgrades and enemies. Unlike this game, it would have an ending too. This game will just run forever, I've customized the first 50 waves a bit, but I feel like the game is a bit too easy when you get settled. If I had left myself more time, I think I would\u00a0have been able to get the difficulty just right. Anyways, thank you for checking the game out, and I hope you have some fun playing it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:53:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/989/98926875989c019be6dc6878a2b21c54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maxthedoom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
