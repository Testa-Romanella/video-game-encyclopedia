ALT + F4).</strong></p>\n<p>In the future, I\u2019d like to add an EXIT control and a cleaner GAME OVER mode that shows the total frogs counted and an option to PLAY AGAIN to make it easier to play.</p>\n<p>Have fun racing to collect the frogs before time runs out and make sure you have your volume on for some fun accompanying music.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing my game!!</p>\n\n<p>Assets Used or Referenced:<br/>(Acquired from Unity Asset Store)</p>\n<p>\"Toxic Frogs\" by Ryo Arai<br/>\"Grass Road Race\" by Sugar Asset<br/>\"Indian kanoe\" by\u00a0\u00a0Malecite<br/>\"Lowpoly Medieval World\" by Polytope Studio<br/>\"Low-Poly Simple Nature Pack\" by JustCreate<br/>\"Free Piano Loops\" by\u00a0\u00a0Platypus Patrol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T06:41:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/306/30638cbe5913510f1c153c014585ba7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Game Dev Debbie"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
