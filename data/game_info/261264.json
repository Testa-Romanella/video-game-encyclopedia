Got tired after a rough day of work or feeling stressed out due to college? Jump in the game for some tracks to relieve stress and have a blast. The player has to fight against various enemies. Their density is based on the rhythm of the music that you are listening to. Based on your performance the enemies will become more aggressive as well, but don't worry, they will become less dangerous if things get too tough for you. Per track you will be awarded with funds and experience, which can be used to unlock various goods. <br/>If simply a score and funds won't cut it for you then you have the \"mastery\" statistic to keep track of. This indicates how well you performed in the game. Each hit taken will decrease it. Can you keep your personal high score while maintaining a high mastery? <br/><br/>This game is all about music and guns, the two things that are loved by many and so we deliver you a mixture of the two.
