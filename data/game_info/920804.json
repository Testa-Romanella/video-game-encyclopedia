The game represents what would be a larger story condensed into five story beats, with each story representing a memory that has been rediscovered. The game is fully voiced, with mini games that 'unlock' the memories and take you through the narrative. The game has been build using Anything World assets in Unity, with voice overs and music provided as original concepts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T17:26:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3f/d3f5d3f00c30de3838f808cbbd344e61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gordon Midwood"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
