To fight for the tower in an open battlefield within the inner city, each faction has a brief narrative campaign where you get a chance to experience each of the units and strategies of that faction.\u00a0</p>\r\nFactions\r\nRazorCorp\r\n<p><strong>Leader:</strong> Vicia Novas</p>\n<p>The Kingpin of the market, RazorCorp provides all the needs of your everyday government at a fraction of the cost.
