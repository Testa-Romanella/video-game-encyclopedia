This game, as many of my other games, is meant to challenge myself and what I can do with Godot. Soon enough I'll try my best at making a full project that will hopefully not become another demo or just a little week-long project to practice Game Design.<br/><br/>Controls:</p>\n\n<p>WASD - Move your character.</p>\n<p>Mouse - Aim.</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Shoot.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of the game is to get the most amount of points you can before you die. The more points you get the more damage, speed and fire rate your character will get.</p>\n\n<p>You guys can download all the files and source code of my game at it's GitHub repository:\u00a0https://github.com/Wobbufest/Wired</p>\n\n<p>Hope you guys like my little game!<br/></p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:31:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d4/7d4a2ba25c225152f1883dff7cbbaacb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wobbumash"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
