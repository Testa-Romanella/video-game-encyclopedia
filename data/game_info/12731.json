Rest assured that the title is not simple, instead it\u2019s a reminiscence from the older, action packed and hard games that were designed in order to deliver one of a kind gameplay moments.<br/><br/>The coolest thing about Zamarian is that it allows you to control your ship unlike any other game, all while trying to explore the space at your own leisure and killing the enemies that come in your way. The title is designed by a lot of action and plenty of unique gameplay ideas, all of which add up to deliver a stellar outcome all the time. I liked the fact that this game is not afraid to take chances, instead it was designed with a wide range of action packed mechanics in mind. <br/><br/>There are multiple upgrades that you can perform to your vehicle, all of which add up in order to deliver a great shooting experience. The shooting mechanics are solid and the game is created all so that it will provide you with an action packed set of moments that you will always appreciate and enjoy.<br/><br/>Each level has its own boss, and while the first ones can be a simple challenge, the more you play the harder the game will get. The Zamarian alien, which is the ultimate, last boss will be very hard to defeat, and at the same time it also makes the game endless because it will basically grow new tentacles all the time.<br/><br/>All the ideas brought by the game are very interesting to be honest, and they do provide quite an interesting challenge all around, which is magical and tons of fun. I like the fact that you have 2 ships in the free version, because they do show you quite a lot of the game before you purchase. At the same time, I am also very impressed by the quality that they deliver, which is a major plus and a lot better than what you are used to from other titles in the genre.<br/><br/>This game screams retro memorabilia and it\u2019s a good thing, in fact for me it basically revives the old school ideas and it brings them back in a colorful and fun way. I really liked it, and I do recommend Zamarian to everyone that wants a fun time regardless of where they are located!<br/><br/>9/10", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:11:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5c5c20e7b7763bcf6455bc2e78b26cc.jpg", "website": "http://www.quarterpoundstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 99}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Quarter Pound Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
