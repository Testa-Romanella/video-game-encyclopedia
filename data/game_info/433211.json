There are ten levels in total, good luck bearing the sacred flame, Keeper!</p>\n\n<p>This game was created in one weekend for Ludum Dare #46 Game Jam.\u00a0The theme for the jam was \"Keep it Alive\". The idea to make the game a platformer where you keep a torch burning came to me early, and everything really fell into place. The game was written in\u00a0Game Maker Studio 2, and\u00a0the art, music, and design were all done by me alone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:29:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47ad699ec67066f8eda4ec9c9cf0906.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nick Ver Voort"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
