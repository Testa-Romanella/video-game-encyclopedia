They are the first Pokemon games made for Nintendo Switch. Both of them are loose remakes of the 1998 game Pokemon Yellow that was released for Game Boy. Both games are set in the region of Kanto in the Pokemon universe. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>As usual in the Pokemon games, the players use their Pokemon (small monsters) to fight against other Pokemon, either wild or controlled by other characters. Unlike in the classic Pokemon games, however, Pokemon: Let&#39;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#39;s Go, Eevee! are based on a mechanic similar to Pokemon GO. Using the Switch Joy-Con, the player throws Poke Ball at the wild Pokemon. </p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, the player only has one Pokemon, either Pikachu for the former version of the game or Eevee for the latter. Unlike in most Pokemon games, the player&#39;s Pokemon don&#39;t have to stay in the Poke Balls all the time. Pikachu and Eevee perch on the player character&#39;s shoulder, and the player can choose another pokemon to follow his or her main character.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>The two games only feature 151 playable classic Pokemon as well as their various forms, but not the whole Pokemon roster. The player can connect his or her Switch to the smartphone to upload the Pokemon he or she already has in Pokemon Go. The characters&#39; appearances are customizable, including their gender.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Both games allow cooperative multiplayer for two players. They can share a single Nintendo Switch by taking either of its Joy-Cons.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-17T14:55:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6a6/6a68e7e64bf02c9e9b0f090491df93e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.78, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 42, "owned": 125, "beaten": 359, "toplay": 121, "dropped": 123, "playing": 60}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 331, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 339, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Game Freak", "The Pokemon Company"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
