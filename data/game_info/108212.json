However, in this platformer, you cannot jump. You might think 'what's the fun in platforming, then?' Puzzle solving, exploration and just enjoying a more relaxed interpretation of the metroidvania genre. And you will be offered a pretty interesting choice should you make it to the end of the game...</p>\n<p>In the Game Boy Jam, the goal was to make a game inspired by the original handheld, and to use it's resolution and a limited color palette, within ten days. If you would like to experience the world without hand-holding, then you are free to do so. If you need just a little extra push to figure out what to do, you can use the sign posts placed near all interesting locations.</p>\n<p>Vote for the Game Boy Jam here.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Arrow Keys/WASD/ZQSD: Move<br/>Up: Float (upgrade required)<br/>Down: Ground pound (upgrade required)<br/>Space/Enter/E: Interact (Talk, Read, Save, etc.)<br/>R: Return to previous checkpoint<br/>Shift: Toggle music</p>\n<p>Any key will process dialog text.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/607/6072c9d0e7c1b89face00fc6bd14ff4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Auroriax"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
