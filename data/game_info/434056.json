You have recently moved into a new house, but now you have a problem. Some spooky things live in your basement, and their spooky sounds woke you up deep at night. Do you dare venture into the dark void of your basement, make the spooky monsters go to sleep, and not fall asleep yourself?</p>\n<p>Just a small silly game on the brink of two themes - Keep it alive and Turn a violent genre non-violent. WASD to move, arrow keys to rotate, E to interact. Put every monster in the dungeon to sleep, use the ladder to advance to the next level (it\u2019s infinite), all while trying to keep the flame in your lamp and yourself \u201calive\u201d. If your lamp oil runs out - you start to get dozy and lose consciousness. If you fall asleep - you lose.</p>\n<p>Some technical notes - written in Python3 with minimum C libraries, so adjust your performance expectations accordingly. But it was a fun learning and recreational experience, so we don\u2019t mind.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD to move, arrow keys to rotate, E to interact.</p>\r\nKnown features bugs:\r\n<ul><li>Walking into a ladder can have to getting stuck in a wall, just back out if it happens.</li><li>Sometimes the level generator can be mean, please restart if that happens</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T07:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e6011066f856886cbb181d7cb3a88ec4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["lesslwo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
