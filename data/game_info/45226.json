This is the first time a virtual reality app showcases <strong>2d to 3d conversions</strong> of famous paintings and old photographs.<br/><br/>When looking at these paintings in VR, the paintings themselves can also be experienced in 3d.<br/><br/>For each painting or photograph, background information can be accessed. Spread out through the museum are miniature models from which the 3d images were generated.<br/><br/>There are a total of 54 paintings and photographs on display from artists such as Rembrandt, Bierstadt, Monet. Included is also a special exhibition of photographs taken in New York before 1900 by Jacob Riis.<br/><br/>I hope you will enjoy having a walk through the museum.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d19/d196749465922585e3b732fa46529e09.jpg", "website": "http://www.throughview.eu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erwin Wolf"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MarWin Studios", "ThroughView"], "esrb_rating": null}
