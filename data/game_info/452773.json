In it, Eanfl\u00e6d, a young mercian girl in the IX century, takes it upon herself to seek out the dreaded witch Black Brida and bargain for her little brother's life. I employed branching narrative technique and choices that modify available options for progression. Eanfl\u00e6d may end up a different person from a playthrough to another.</p><p>In this version I removed some effects that might make it hard to read for some people.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:46:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38a7fef483d610179e3edb95c3e79023.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Leonardo Andrade"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
