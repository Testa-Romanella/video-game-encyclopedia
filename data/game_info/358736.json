Your job is to shoot down the enemy towers (red squares). However, there are also other squares that want to shoot you! If you get shot just once, you have to start the whole level over. But if you're lucky, you might find a better gun to replace your cheap pistol! Have fun, and watch out for zombies, and explosives, and giant evil bosses that shoot lasers and bullets and rockets everywhere!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T09:25:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/50351af04dfef35ea5a8e37fd8ad8ba3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wjtaylor"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
