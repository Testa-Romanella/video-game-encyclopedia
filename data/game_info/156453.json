The themes were: put it back together, dinosaur, and a few others that\u00a0I don't remember.</p>\n<p>This game is still in its submission state. As such, avoid releasing boxes near the peak of your jump. This may cause the game to freeze permanently.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move around. Press j to pick up or throw a box. Holding s and pressing j will pick up a box below you or place a held box gently at your feet. Pressing s will also drop you through thin platforms.\u00a0Press r to restart a level if you mess up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c7f06420ff235a5d1fe7aa9885b3371.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["schine"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
