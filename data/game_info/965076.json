You will restart each level if you manage to hit any of the obstacles so the moral of the story is go steady, keep your calm and dont rush!!!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is a pause menu - try and find it on the screen, it will take the player to the menus where you can decide how brave you want to be.  Do you want to do level 9 straight away or take it easy and build up your experience levels until you reach the final destination.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt the end of the day have fun and enjoy -", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T05:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/470/470a507f8e068471164628dfdb57b11e.jpg", "website": "https://wijsoftware.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William Jones"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["William Jones"], "esrb_rating": null}
