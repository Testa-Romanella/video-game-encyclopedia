Use mouse to control. It was made in a month's period for a game jam, so it's not nearly perfect nor finished (like, because of a technical problem there is no new game option...).\u00a0I made 3 scenes, and only one character to scare away. There are stuff you can interact with in certain ways. You can pick up some objects, put some of them down on the correct place, and you can even combine some. I tried to place hints on what to do, and it's not too hard to play through. :) Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:52:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d8/6d848b258075b8086d0ba4465ef63b74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LtCoyote"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
