This game is the first game I personally made. It has been developed for 11 months. Because of other work, the development progress is somewhat slow.<br/>2. Thank my good friend Li Nan for making two songs for me.<br/>3. There are many ideas and ideas that will be slowly added in the days to come.<br/>4. There is no suspension and preservation in the game. What I want to express is that if I really survive and wait for rescue in a city surrounded by zombies, I will only live once.<br/>5. There are two endings in the game.<br/>6. Dear players, if you have any suggestions, ideas and dissatisfaction, please tell me not to hold back!<br/>7.
