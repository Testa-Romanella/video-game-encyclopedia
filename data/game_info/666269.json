Two people are stuck in the elevator for hours and they\u00a0start to interact with each other, but awkwardly they start to love each other.\r\n</p>\n<p>In this prototype, the puzzle becomes the main part of the story,\u00a0because people start communicating very hard, same as solving a\u00a0difficult jigsaw puzzle. There is no win or fail, but to complete or\u00a0give up.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:51:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e6/9e654ec991a813ef564013733685ab71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Xin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
