To deactivate a mine, just <strong>move on it</strong> !<br/></p>\n<p>As usual, i made it all alone, from graphics to music and sound.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy play this game, and don't forget to leave me any comments if you want :-)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e58834acfae360f6761eaaaafe34fd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["grostonton"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
