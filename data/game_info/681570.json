Most of them lumped into gangs battling for dominion, each led by its own head honcho. Yet even these bad dudes are no match for the Demon King himself! Instead the task falls to Beebz, a young demon barely a thousand years old, who decides it\u2019s time for her to kick every turf leader\u2019s butt and become the Demon Queen herself.<br />\nA unique aesthetic combining the expressiveness of 2D illustrations with the depth and sense of exploration 3D environments can offer!<br />\nA world chock-full of humor and style, from the music accompanied by the protagonist\u2019s rapping to the colorful characters inhabiting the world!<br />\nA unique take on progression! Take a victory lap and explore previously beaten levels to discover their liberated state, with plenty of mechanical and environmental changes to uncover. Or take some time off in the hub town taking on sidequests and other distinct challenges instead.<br />\nPull off some clever platforming combinations or get physical with a special physics-driven combat system that ramps up the chaos and fun. Push, pull and spin your enemies out of your way.<br />\nA different take on checkpoints, freeing the player to place them wherever they want. Show off without them for a perfect run, or place one in preparation for a challenging section.<br />\nUnique challenges like the \u201cPhoto Hunt\u201d mode where you\u2019re tasked to take pictures of hidden locations &amp; surprising moments! Or simply take picures and selfies for fun and share them across all social media!<br />\nAn awesome collection of purchasable mods that can be combined in clever ways to completely change your play style! Or you could buy some dyes &amp; pets instead, the world&#39;s your oyster!<br />\nTons of carefully crafted levels that constantly introduce new challenges as well as en- gaging bosses full of character and life! Until Beebz gets to them...<br />\nFrom the makers of Slime-san comes their newest creation! The team used everything they learned from their 2D platformer to elevate this 3D platformer to the next level!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-18T00:37:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a28/a289b31f456f1837fabc2fd2f0a9ed1e.jpg", "website": "http://demonturf.com/", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 22, "owned": 179, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 13, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 80, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PlayStation 5", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Fabraz"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Playtonic Friends"], "esrb_rating": null}
