{"id": 2749, "slug": "screencheat", "name": "Screencheat", "name_original": "Screencheat", "description": "<p>Screencheat is a rare kind of game that encourages its players to cheat. It is an online multiplayer-only game that allows a sort of second-person view. The players cannot see their opponents, but they can see what their opponents see.</p>\n<h3>Premise</h3>\n<p>Screencheat is based on the idea of &quot;screen cheating,&quot; a form of cheating in local multiplayer in which the cheaters peeks at the other players&#39; monitors to see what they&#39;re doing. This kind of behavior is unwelcome in most games, but Screencheat is built around it. </p>\n<p>The characters in the game are invisible, and the players cannot see each other. However, they have access to other players&#39; views. The screen is divided into four segments, in the vein of Goldeneye 007. Each of them translates a player&#39;s view so that everyone can see what the others do. It allows the opponents to track each other by detecting the locations of other players in respect to the environment.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Beyond its novel idea, Screencheat is played as a regular 3D shooter. The player controls his or her invisible protagonist from the first person view. The characters have no hit points and die instantly if injured. The game offers a variety of weapons with different stats of accuracy and range, such as a shotgun, a grenade launcher, or a rifle. There are also comical improvised melee weapons such as a hobby horse.</p>", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2014-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-09T15:02:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c3/1c305353b224d8196489bbc4792a4c0b.jpg", "website": "https://samuraipunk.com/screencheat", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 62, "owned": 1138, "beaten": 24, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 49, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 208, "ratings_count": 79, "suggestions_count": 490, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 79, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["SURPRISE ATTACK", "Samurai Punk"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Surprise Attack"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
