How many can you destroy before they overwhelm you?</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions: </strong><br/>Use W, A, S, D, or the Arrow keys to move the character around. Use Space to shoot. The objective is to shoot and destroy as many blocks as you can. Shooting a block that has the same color blocks touching it will cause all of the touching blocks to also be destroyed, and will net a higher score than if they were destroyed individually.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong><br/>This game is a submission for Ludum Dare 41 (Theme: Combine two incompatible genres). Shooter meets endless puzzle block game. It's my first game jam and first solo game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/348/34833468183514a0ce936ef1fb465a59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ShinyTurtle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
