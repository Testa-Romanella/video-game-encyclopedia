{"id": 745802, "slug": "dungeon-crawler-2", "name": "Dungeon Crawler", "name_original": "Dungeon Crawler", "description": "Dungeon Crawler is a round-based, third-person, rogue-like, fantasy-style, atmospheric indie game. You are on your quest for fame, diving diligently into a dungeon full of hostile creatures to free mankind from an ancient evil that is told to dwell in the deepest depth of these caves. On your journey you will slay monsters, loot equipment and gain XP to level up and access perks that let you grow and sustain.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>MOVEMENT</strong><br/>Navigate by clicking the highlighted ground tiles. Not all tiles will be accessible at all times as they can be blocked by creatures or need to be activated by passing rooms that are generated procedurally.<br/><br/><strong>ROUND-BASED</strong><br/>This is a round based journey. You perform one action per round (walk, guard, attack or cast a spell - if you acquired magic perk). Once your round is finished, creatures will take actions...<br/><br/><strong>DEATH</strong><br/>On death, you respawn at the deungeon entrance, ready for your next trial. Sadly, items and equipment are lost, however experience, level and perks remain, increasing your power slowly but surely over time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>HITPOINTS</strong><br/>You start with 2 hitpoints (HP) and lose one on each hit taken. Once HP reach zero, you die and restart, unless you have a health potion equipped, which restores HP to its max.<br/><br/><strong>COMBAT</strong><br/>Attack creatures by clicking their tile. Pay attention to combat stats shown on the pillars and callouts - you might find some hints on hidden mechanics to improve your combat tactics and sustainability.<br/><br/><strong>DICE</strong><br/>Combat is performed using stats and dice. A die can hold up to 5 \"success\" sides (but at least has 1 \"fail\" side). If stats exceed 5, you will get further dice (2 dice = up to 10, 3 dice = up to 15 success sides, etc). Attackers roll first and if successful, defenders rolls to check if the attack can be blocked or evaded.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong><br/>Gain experience by killing creatures and clearing rooms. Once a certain threshold is met, you will level up and gain access to apply permanent perks.<br/><br/><strong>PERKS</strong><br/>On each level up, you will pick from mighty perks that will remain even upon death, so better pick wisely! Perks can be reset when resetting your complete progress in the main menu. Combination of perks are key to impact the way you play, like making you tankier or taking an assassins path.<br/><br/><strong>LOOT</strong><br/>Loot can be healing potions, spells and equipment. Chests provide random equipment. When picking up equipment, stats will be rolled. If stats are higher than the current ones, you keep the new equipment. The deeper you move into the dungeon, the higher the stats of rolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/>\u2022 Type: Casual Round-Based Rogue-Like Dungeon Crawler<br/>\u2022 Weapons: Sword (Melee), Bow (Ranged), Shield (Defense), Spells<br/>\u2022 Size: Tutorial, 1 Dungeon with 4 Stages<br/>\u2022 Encounters: Zombies, Skeleton-Crossbows, -Warriors, -Mages, Demon<br/>\u2022 Progression: up to Level 10, up to 10 perks<br/>\u2022 Controls: All you need to play is a mouse to point and click<br/>\u2022 Language: In-Game language is English, however there's not too much text at all<br/><br/><strong>Good luck and safe travels!
