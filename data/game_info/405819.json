It was maybe kind of fun.</p>\n\n<p>So I thought what I'd do is <strong>evolve it a bit</strong>; the triangle morphed into a space ship\u00a0and those circles became asteroids made of hexagons. Lasers got involved, a bigger ship entered the picture, and fuel and harvesting systems started to appear.\u00a0Now this simple experiment is\u00a0<strong>beginning to take shape</strong>\u00a0as something that I think others might find maybe kind of fun.</p>\n\n<p>Download it and let me know what you think. I'm just going to keep evolving this simple experiment bit by bit until maybe we can <strong>find some kind of fun</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T04:21:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc0cf2df1659bb1fe4259967735e2e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["null theorem"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
