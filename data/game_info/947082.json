Perhaps the valuables were left untouched for a very good reason.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move<br/>SHIFT - Sprint<br/>CTRL - Crouch<br/>E - Interact<br/>LMB - Throw<br/>Hold RMB\u00a0- Charge Torch</p>\n<p><strong>Developed by The Mermaid MenZ</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ethan Uy\u00a0</strong>- Team Lead, Programming Lead\u00a0<br/><strong>Wilbur Arnott\u00a0</strong>- Game Design Lead<br/><strong>Darren Contreras</strong>\u00a0- Art Lead, Character Designer, Voice Overs<br/>\n<strong>Christian Logoia\u00a0</strong>- 3D Generalist Artist, Robots, Graybox\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Ethan Buot</strong>\u00a0- Level Designer, Environment and Set Dressing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T07:59:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/534/5340eca3e81a9325c83865674ca4704a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christian_03", "ethonk", "ethan_322", "Mermaid MenZ", "wilbblur", "\ud83e\udd96Deerex"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
