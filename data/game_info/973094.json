So what you see is what we all are looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFast dynamic lateral movement and ideal projectile randomness incorporated with stylized animations which are generated dynamically via Unreal Engine's animation montage system, which by the way, is eye candy. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe are using the Lyra shooter project as our base and as we go. I am planning to create customizable guns and characters along with providing stat based ranking and comparative match making.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis will be the first game Ive created by myself so be aware Ill do my best to make this something good. This project was created for our community to have fun in a semi private way. As well this is a test of the unreal engines main shooter template LYRA which I'll be modifying as we go so updates will be a thing however I also know this thing is buggy! lol There are some audio glitching happening during respawns. Might just wanna turn that music volume down till I can get a fix for that.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow this is a basic third person shooter with a litany of baked in and ready to utilize features that over time I am going to learn and hopefully be able to modify and implement.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI also want to point out that the networking system is janky ATM so we use Epic to run the game server hosting experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll and all The game, so far, is functional and very small at a whopping 1.8 gigs<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo technically almost anyone can play it! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIm hoping to have cross platform and VR worked out at some point in the future and honestly it could be working already however I have not been able to test it in that format yet. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are currently 10 maps included. Demon Station, Big Star Station, Convolution, Expanse, Space station, Soul Slum Forest, Soul Slum, Soul Cave, Shooter Gym and Overworld.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are currently 7 guns included. They are: Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle, Auto Sniper, Grenade, Grenade launcher, Rocket launcher.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHealth pickups are a thing as well.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI hope you enjoy the project and Thanks in advance for any form of feedback going forward.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T07:09:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f22/f22f70fec2a0ed5d798839663d6d1a94.jpg", "website": "https://unrealmashup.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Goldsworthy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["John Goldsworthy"], "esrb_rating": null}
