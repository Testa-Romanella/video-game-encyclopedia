The final exam of the School of Wizards awaits you.<br/><br/>You have trained hard all these years.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The exam dungeons have been cleaned, and our legions of golems are on the move.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Everything is ready for your evaluation.<br/><br/>We wholeheartedly wish this class to become the best of all time!<br/><br/>Warm regards,<br/>The School of Wizards Administration<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Students have access to 6 types of magic: fire, ice, lightning, necromancy, telekinesis, and technomancy.<br/><br/></li><li> Each student can learn up to 4 minor spells that automatically target enemies.<br/><br/></li><li> Each student can learn a major spell that is cast manually.<br/><br/></li><li> The dungeons are scattered with very powerful one-time-use spells:<br/><br/> <ul> <li> Trances allow each student to push their limits.<br/><br/> </li><li> Calamities are summons of devastating natural powers.\t</li></ul><br/></li><li> Speed rounds: The exam lasts less than 15 minutes per student.<br/><br/></li><li> The exam requires surviving twelve dungeons, randomly chosen from a pool of around twenty.<br/><br/></li><li> Collect money and gems to purchase artifacts that will \"aid\" in the exam. It's a bit like cheating, well, kind of...<br/><br/></li><li> Collect experience orbs to enhance your abilities and learn new spells.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> When an exit portal activates, stay a little longer. Even though the enemies become enraged and more numerous, it's also an opportunity to gain more experience and wealth.<br/><br/></li><li> Do not follow the previous advice, it's far too dangerous! We have only one piece of advice once the portal is open: \"Fly, you fools!\"<br/><br/></li><li> Jars are scattered throughout the dungeons. Some of them contain skill-enhancing potions. It would be a shame to pass them up.<br/><br/></li><li> If you manage to master a major spell, you can delay its casting by remaining in the summoning circle. Depending on the situation, this can be useful to maximize the spell's impact on the golems.<br/><br/></li><li> Calamities are incredibly powerful summoning spells, but they are a double-edged sword: they make no distinction between you and your enemies.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T06:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/162c99b6243d0f48c40f4a55b5a0c2e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["My pixel is alive!"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["My pixel is alive!"], "esrb_rating": null}
