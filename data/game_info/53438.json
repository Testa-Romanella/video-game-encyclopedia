It released on the Sony PlayStation console in all regions, and was later released on the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast exclusively in North America. Unlike the previous 20th Anniversary Pac-Man World, the player must follow along designated paths. It was well received for its simple gameplay, staying true to the original 'Ms. Pac-Man' game, but its multiplayer mode was at times heavily criticized.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-29T01:37:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c43/c434fed477a593c88574b0a08d200439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 28, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Dreamcast", "PlayStation", "Nintendo 64", "Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["NAMCO", "Mass Media", "Full Fat", "Namco Hometek"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Namco", "SCEE", "ZOO Digital Publishing", "Zushi Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
