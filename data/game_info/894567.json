In a theatrical setting, survive the utterly confusing and twisted dinner. You will be observed and judged, so face reality, weigh every action, consider possible outcomes, make choices - and define the conclusion of this life-changing celebration.<br />\nAfter all, what happens here is not your problem\u2026<br />\n\u2026 or is it?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-31T13:23:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b4a/b4a01bf2f8c13821107e101d41607e0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 76, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sever", "Prismatika"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Prismatika"], "esrb_rating": null}
