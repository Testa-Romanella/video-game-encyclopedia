Training is now central to your rider's career and development. Determine the season's key moments and your improvement targets so you can keep pace with developments.

The world rankings for all riders and for the season's races are now consolidated to make it easier to see individual results.<br/>Rider rankings are based on a 52-week system, and the 2023 season will begin with the existing world ranking. There will be an update to the ranking each week, which will add and remove points from the previous version.  The update will remove points from the previous year and will add points earned during the current year.<br/>The world team rankings will begin on 1 January, and each team will start with 0 points. It's up to you and your teammates to win as many points as possible!<h3>IMPROVED RACES</h3><br/>Improvements have also been made to the races to make them fairer. Sprints have been revised, mass finishes are now handled better and race endings are more realistic. <br/>During races with stages and depending on the situation, riders may gain an advantage from the Grupetto, saving their energy for the days to come. This means some riders are fresher and more competitive during sprints and for the final stages at the end of a race.<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2063610/Pro_Cycling_Manager_2023</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T09:37:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d7/7d7ad1b2b0fb5b38dc361b8f345b8f3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 276, "achievements_count": 65, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyanide Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Nacon"], "esrb_rating": null}
