The main focus for\u00a0this game\u00a0is support. It is always comforting to know that there is someone you can rely \u00a0on when you are emotionally drained\u00a0but how much can one take before feeling taken advantage of.\u00a0 At some point you have to make it through the challenge alone to win.</p>\n\n<p>Game Play</p>\n<p>\u00a0It has relatively simple game play\u00a0 each level has a certain number of collectibles and each of these has a different value depending on the colour i.e red has 2 points,yellow has 4 etc. The aim is to reach the end point with\u00a0 as may points as possible but not taking too much from them just as the story indicates.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T11:27:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f29/f29da1c861c054a28656b438af39bc2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keratuwe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
