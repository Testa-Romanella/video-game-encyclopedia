When you encounter an enemy, they will first go into a \"taunt\" animation, and then the fight begins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the fight, the enemy will do an animation that signifies if they are going to attack on the next turn. (As you play, you will start to see a pattern). This is also when the player will have to decide what weapon they thing best suits the following turn. <em>Will the enemy attack?</em> Use a shield. <em>Are they vulnerable?</em> whip about a sword.\u00a0</p>\r\nNow, the inventory system\r\n\n<p>You can open up your inventory by pressing <strong>T\u00a0</strong>(Shown in Red)</p><ul><li>Each Item in your inventory takes up space. The rarer the weapons, the more inventory space they take up. (Shown in Blue)</li></ul><p>After each turn, the enemy will drop two random loot, corresponding to their level (Shown in Purple)</p><ul><li>You can pick the dropped weapons up with the <strong>E</strong> or <strong>R </strong>keys. Note that you have to have the appropriate amount of inventory space, and you haven't locked in a weapon.</li></ul><p>This wheel indicates that you can pick what items you want to use, and what you want to throw away.\u00a0<br/></p><ul><li>Use the <strong>Left and Right\u00a0Arrows</strong>\u00a0on\u00a0 your keyboard to cycle through your current inventory</li><li>Use the <strong>Up Arrow</strong> to <em>lock in</em> what item you would like to use</li><li>Use the <strong>Down Arrow</strong> to throw away the item.</li></ul><p>There's a whole lot more mechanics in the back end like rarity based shielding, but thats for you to figure it out.
