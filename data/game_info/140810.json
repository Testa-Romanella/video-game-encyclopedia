All you do is file paperwork and wait for the days to while away. And to top it all off, you have a SUPER nosy boss (who is probably just as bored as you are) that checks in on you\u00a0<em>constantly</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have to fine things to occupy your time before you are bored to death. But your company's crazy strict and has ancient computers. If your boss catches you not focusing, there will be \"serious\" consequences.</p>\n<p>/This game was made by 2 people in under 48hrs for a local GameJam. The theme was \"spin\".
