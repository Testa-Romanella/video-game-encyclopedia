The theme 'a matter of degree'\r\nfits because the job you can get is a matter of which degrees you\r\nhave.<br/></p>\n<p>Right\r\nnow the game is talking to people, earning degrees and building stats\r\nfor no reason, since I haven't added the endings.</p>\n<p>The\r\nfinal version will be out in four weeks starting <em>after</em>\r\nnext week. So five weeks from now. In the meantime I'll be taking a\r\nbreak.</p>\n<p>What\r\nI'll be adding:<br/>Introduction,\r\nso you're not just thrown into the game.<br/>Replace\r\nsketch sprites and add expressions.<br/>Add\r\nendings.<br/>Gift\r\ngiving, because having everyone love you is needed for one of the\r\nendings. Right now the only way to gain affection is to talk to them\r\nonce a day.<br/>Consequences\r\nto having low stats, currently you can ignore your happiness as much as you want with nothing happening.</p>\n<p>I'm heavily\r\nconsidering not adding  dating. I wanted it because I had an idea for\r\nthe dating system, but marriage wont be a thing in this game and if\r\nfeels unnecessary when you can just give gifts with no limit.</p>\n<p>\r\nSome\r\nof this stuff is drawn and written but I didn't have time to add it\r\nto the game, of course, you never have enough time in a game jam\r\nright? This alone wont take the entire month but I'll be working on\r\nanother game along side it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T02:25:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e52/e52f0776332d66a200f72d83ba8242dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jaydalyn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
