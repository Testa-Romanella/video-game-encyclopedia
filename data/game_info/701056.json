(NES Prototype)", "description": "<p>Created for the \"<strong>Lost</strong> <strong>Cartridge Jam 2021\":</strong><br/></p>\n<p>_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_</p>\n<p>The game is in an early prototype state. I only want to try the good software \"NES Assets Workshop\" (NAW) (see https://nesrocks.itch.io/naw\u00a0;\u00a0you can find my draft-file in the tool format *.naw in the download section, too. Maybe you can use it).\u00a0\u00a0I used a picture a floppy disk\u00a0from \"pixabay.com\" for the cover picture, which I had\u00a0edited.</p>\n<p>I wanted to build a little idea, which related to the spirit of the 80's. So I asked my kids for a\u00a0<strong>concept of an alien / UFO game</strong>. They made a good job:</p>\n\n<p>The goal\u00a0 was only to publish our idea / our game landscape. With a lack of time and actual possibilities we decided to only use the NAW export to present it.</p>\n<p> When we think about a fictive story it could bi like this:\u00a0 Kids made the concept picture above. Someone tried to realize it for a first publisher presentation, but didn't get far. But he\u00a0 /\u00a0 she put this prototype on a floppy disk and archived it in a drawer for the future. And here it is: A little result of a game Idea from the past.\r\n </p>\n<p> I hope you enjoy it for a few seconds. You only can do some little things in the game: Fly over our small world. You can move to every direction.</p>\n<p>Run the game\u00a0by\u00a0executing\u00a0on PlayDemo.bat\u00a0to launch the rom in the emulator FCEUX (i had this good idea from a great NES homebrew game from Skyboy Games. I can recommend \"Orphea\").</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T05:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5da/5da34beec27b3427269b493c4ded0641.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["torte00"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
