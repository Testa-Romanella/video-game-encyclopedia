As the game progresses, you'll be introduced to events, operations and loops.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is a fun puzzle game in it's own right, but it can be an excellent introduction to programming for kids from 8 (with some adult help) and up (we've had 10-year-olds solve all the puzzles on their own).<br/></p><p>It's very similar to Scratch in how the programming works, so once you have mastered these levels, you can comfortably move over to a more open ended experience.\u00a0 Scratch can\u00a0be\u00a0a little intimidating to start out with, because you not only need to figure out how to do something, but also what to do. It's like a blank piece of paper. The levels of this game gives you the what, you just have to figure out the how.<br/></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f14/f14729268d2a7a492cd7931064cb129c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mfagerlund"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
