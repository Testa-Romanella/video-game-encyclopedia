Hint: Try pressing up or down even if it seems like the block won't move.\u00a0Upon completing a game select 's' for the same game mode and 'd' for a new one.</p>\n<p>This is a simple block moving game. My aim was to make a 4 x 4 grid game where the main idea of the game was to solve a small puzzle with no directions.\u00a0The directions will change when you load a new game, but the controls are always the arrow keys. You cannot get yourself into an unwinnable state.</p>\n<p>Different block designs are selected with the following keys:</p>\n<p>'3' for 3D block design.</p>\n<p>'C' for color blind block design.</p>\n<p>'4' for a 4 by 4 pixel game design.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.\u00a0This is the first game I've ever made and I really enjoyed making it and learning a lot. I hope you enjoyed playing.</p><p>Music is Cyberpunk\u00a0Moonlight Sonata by Joth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:22:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2f/b2f53d86aedb005f19907a50757c75d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheOneBlueGecko"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
