In an attempt to make something a bit out of the ordinary with it!<br/><br/>You wake up to find yourself trapped in an unknown underground maze. Explore the maze and find your way out! <br/><strong>Instructions:</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>Use your arrow keys to move. <br/>\u2191: Forward<br/>\u2193: Backward<br/>\u2192: Turn Right<br/>\u2190: Turn Left</p>\n<p>If on a mobile browser, then just swipe in the direction you want to move.<br/><br/>To help keep your bearings in the maze, the compass' arrows will highlight which cardinal direction you're facing.<br/><br/>While exploring the dungeon, your compass' North arrow may be replaced with an exclamation mark ( ! ) This indicates that something can be investigated. Press the \u2191 key or swipe up to do so.<br/><br/>Protip: If you end up getting lost in the maze don't hesitate to bust out some graph paper! ;)<strong><br/>______________________________________________________________________________</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Changelog:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(v1.031)<br/>-Fixed a typo in the added text.<br/>(v1.03:)<br/>-Added some text to make encounters 2 and 3 more consistent with the first encounter.<br/>(v1.02:)<strong><br/>-Fixed three movement bugs</strong><br/>-Altered a line of intro text to better reflect writing perspective<br/>-Upgraded the textbox with a border, as well as aligned it at the bottom, as opposed to the top.
