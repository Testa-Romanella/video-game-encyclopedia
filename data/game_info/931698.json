I thought it would be reasonable to have a sort of horror aspect placed upon the original narrative clone through a narrative standpoint of adding both a ghost that follows you and will kill you if it gets close to you, as well as sound and visual design. I changed the characters to\u00a0 be cult-looking, but having the player have some features that make them different. The idea was to d something within my range, so adding a sort of artifact that the player needed to retrieve made sense within the narrative and also was in the base game. I added that the ghost only spawned when the player took the ring as a sort of narrative idea, and then when players get to the shrine they return the ring, the ghost goes away since it is no longer angry. I think the game is good for what I\u00a0know I am capable of and for how much time I had.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T11:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77d/77d3e1ab805d9d81e559b2f0d703b2e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rawrku"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
