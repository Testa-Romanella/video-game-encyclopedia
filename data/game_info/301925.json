I've been coding for couple of years starting with Scratch, a bit of JavaScript and now Python. I've built this game with the help of my dad.</p>\n<p>Game has 5 levels. Each level gets progressively harder. Your goal is to complete all levels and get the highest score. The various bricks are falling from the sky. You control a white turret at the bottom. The goal of the game is to kill off as many bricks as possible. Each brick that you miss and it hits the bottom decreases the life count -1. Each brick you hit - gives you ammo (white) or an extra life (green) or a +1 score (red).</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f84d9d597817d319622f398d14d7c51d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vlad"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
