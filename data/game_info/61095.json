{"id": 61095, "slug": "pok", "name": "POK", "name_original": "POK", "description": "So we were making this game about ghost-hunting, but it kinda got out of control. Whoops. Could you please help us clean up the mess?<br/>Join POK, the debug unit, on a unique puzzle adventure where you get to shape the characters - and the characters get to shape you.<br/><br/><br/>On a scale of not broken to broken, the world of POK is ridiculously broken. We need some a lot of help fixing it. But hey, it's as simple as pressing buttons on a keyboard! Oh, actually, pressing a button. The other ones are sort of... temporarily out of order. So that the puzzles are more challenging.<br/><br/><br/>The quirky personalities that have evolved over the years when the game was running are there to help you - and they'll also need your help. Satisfaction (and abstract philosophical thoughts on the nature of existence) guaranteed. Oh, and then there are the Blunts, who haven't acquired sentience yet. Yet.<br/><br/><br/>...like your stubborn character refusing to go where you want him to. We apologize for making the debug unit self-aware, but we really couldn't talk him out of it. Put your problem-solving skills to the test and cooperate with POK to deal with game glitches, crazy Blunts, and broken levels.<br/><br/><br/>Uncover the mysteries of the art gallery, underground research facilities, and forgotten mines under a mangled town. We might have gotten the geometry a bit wrong, but who doesn't like a few impossible triangles?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8b/e8b8cd39cc0cd26070a91e34348e0c85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moonlit"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Moonlit"], "esrb_rating": null}
