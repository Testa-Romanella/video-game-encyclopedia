This time I created a 3D Game about a squirrel that must HARVEST acorns for the winter. The game play is very easy: you have to harvest 10 acorns before time ends (120 seconds).</p>\n<p>You can play with keyboard, using the arrow keys or WASD, or you can also use a Joypad (like X360 Controller).</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>What will your score be? My best score is 10 acorns in 53 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>\"Acorn from Poly by Google\" (https://skfb.ly/6XZ8K) by IronEqual is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/757/7573516bcb7b3d4b5e498f863a93f5e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["turegrappa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
