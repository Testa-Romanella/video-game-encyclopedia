{"id": 289296, "slug": "homebase", "name": "Homebase", "name_original": "Homebase", "description": "<p>Homebase is a survival game with narrative experience about being stranded on a foreign planet and seeking ways to return to earth. It is a game for the latest Global Game Jam, whose topic is \"What home means to you\".</p>\n<p>Players can collect resource and explore the planet, while also be limited by the shortage of oxygen and threats from the enemies. The conflict between seeking safety in home base and exploring more space for higher reward and solution for leaving this planet may create an interesting emotional relationship between players and their base.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, we hope players to gradually realize and recognize what \"home\" means to them. The shelter that provides safety, the place you are getting familiar with, the house you built by yourself, or the real \"home\" in your mind.</p>\n\n<p>==========================================================</p>\n<p>Credit\uff1a</p>\n<p>Developers:</p>\n<p>Xi (Luciax) - Game Designer, Artist, UI &amp; System Programmer, Sound designer,</p>\n<p>Simon - Game Designer, Gameplay &amp; System Programmer</p>\n<p>Shervie -\u00a0Game Designer, Assisted artist, Sound Designer</p>\n\n<p>Asset:</p>\n<p>2D Isometric Foliage Pack - Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>Ground Texture Hand Paint Starter Kit\u00a0- Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>Epic Firefly Effects\u00a0\u00a0- Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>Stylized Environment Effects\u00a0\u00a0- Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>Music from RPGMaker MV (non-commercial use)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T04:00:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f0/5f02e31a3438dc25bbc89e2aafa591d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["luciax1307", "sherviexjy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
