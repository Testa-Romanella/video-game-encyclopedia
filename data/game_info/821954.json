You have found a town who is lead by the Lord of Fairness, and it's time to show them that fairness never pays.</p>\n<p>Use your dice skills to convert the entire town and show them how cheating is the only way.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to move around the town, raising the devotion of each\u00a0home. Try to keep them hidden from the clerics who will stamp out any devotion to your lord. If you run into a cleric, you will have a roll off to see who is beaten.</p>\n<p>You can perform 2 actions per turn. You can move, increase devotion or lower discoverability.</p>\n<p>Each time you perform an action on a house or against a cleric, you can choose to roll or cheat. Your cheat dice appear in the bottom left bar. Save them for when you really need them! You will receive new cheat dice every few turns.</p>\n<p>When you come in contact with a cleric , your cheating skills mean you win ties in the roll off. Be careful,\u00a0if you are defeated it's GAME OVER! Make sure to save some cheat dice for these encounters.</p>\n<p>Clerics will remove all devotion if they discover a house with devotion, so make sure to keep discoverability low. As a house's devotion goes up, so will its discoverability.</p>\n<p>Convert the entire town to win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:33:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/552d807809e9304a9acee89ab5d99c1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["meeeeitch"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
