Finally. Now you can eat all the candy you want and not have to worry about gaining weight! I made just about everything with the help of the Godot game engine, and since you want a link to the main theme for the game, here you go!</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTgYKJgaAMQ<br/></p>\n<p>So this is my first and (so far) only game. I have been putting a few hours here and there into it for a couple really busy months, but as I have been learning more about making games, I decided it would be best to wrap this one up and start on a new game to learn a bigger variety of things. Of course, I used the Dodge The Creeps demo game as a launching pad for this game since it is where I started learning!</p>\n<p>I really am so proud to actually have finished a game. It might not be much, but it's honest work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to support me however you can if you'd like so I can continue making these little projects. I feel like I would be over the moon just to make a single dollar from this game, so that's my goal! One dollar :)</p>\n<p>Here is a link to the Godot license:</p>\n<p>https://godotengine.org/license<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/565/56544791b20bdbfda74d3300120a9470.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Ghost Cloud"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
