Theme was \"Sacrifice\", if you didn't noticed. I worked on it during my free time, so please be tolerant haha.</p>\n<p>The game is a platformer, in which you play as a witch who can sacrifice rabbits to resurrect if she dies. There are 5 main mechanics on which I worked during the week : <strong>Jump </strong>(which is not as easy as I thought), <strong>Grab </strong>on platform's corners, <strong>Dash</strong>, <strong>Checkpoints </strong>(which is one of the main mechanics) and <strong>Opponents </strong>(with super-easy AI).</p>\n<p>I also made every assets of the prototype ! The only content which is not made by me is the <em>Cinemachine</em>, because I hadn't enough time to work on a camera's script.</p>\n<p>Everything is free to use, but please credit me if you do so.</p>\n<p>Thus, Enjoy\u00a0! I really had fun during this week !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T05:20:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/391/391a064790533f3d9bb127ed4574114a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Th\u00e9o Bertet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
