It's been a fundamental part of shooter games forever, and it's about time someone flipped it on its head. In normal shooters, cover is used to take shelter from enemies; in Wallbangerz, it's the opposite. Just shooting enemies won't work; the bullet must pass through at least one other object before striking them to do damage.</p>\n<p>Just be warned that the enemy's guns work normally, so don't get too carried away. They come in waves too, so don't get too cocky.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move- W, A, S, D<br/></p>\n<p>Pick up weapon - E<br/></p>\n<p>Reload weapon - R<br/></p>\n<p>Fire weapon - Left mouse<br/></p>\n<p>Pause - Escape<br/></p>\n<p>If you encounter a bug please leave a comment and I'll fix it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T10:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/537/537610e25a11155545e283f9b027d343.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MedicOnDuty"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
