You'll need to arm yourself with plenty of weapons and magical items and\u00a0fight through six dungeons to collect Seals in order to open the gates and then fight and defeat Lord Blackmoor himself... But is it that simple?</p>\n<p>Should it always be about the NPCs giving you their swords and shields? Sometimes they need a bit of help before they'll help you. You could just TAKE their stuff as well, you are the all-powerful adventurer and most of them are retired after all!</p>\n<p>Who are you, really?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c9/5c938fafcbccc79ab3c6cac22503ef7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["poik007"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
