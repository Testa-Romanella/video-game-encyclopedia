He's picked you as the subject of his new obstacle course to test their ability to harm, as he says, \"perfectly average human beings\".</p>\n<p>Of course, kidnapping is a lot of work. He's not a surgeon, but he'll patch you up to keep you running through the course. <strong>Every time you get bit, a part of your body is stripped to the bone, and encased in glass. Your ability to navigate the course will decrease accordingly.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You have three minutes to make it to the exit before he floods the room with a toxic gas. Depending on how many body parts you retain, you may receive a unique ending to the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Navigate the course, avoid detection from the zombies- or take advantage of their attention and their slow movement- and make it to the end before time runs out.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Developed in three (3) days for the Winter Jam 2023, hosted by SoloDevelopment</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T16:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93c/93cbdd2018d5964cd8c81c887a31fd3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux"], "developers": ["Eldridge Jameson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
