The primary themes for this jam were sex and romance. The secondary theme was intimacy.</p>\n<p>The actual game is very simple and quite quick to play.</p>\n<p>You're trying to get closer with Karen. Various text options will pop up on the screen. If you click on the good ones, your level of intimacy increases (shown by the level of purple behind Karen). If you click on the bad ones, it decreases.\u00a0If you do nothing, it also\u00a0gradually decreases.\u00a0Options come quickly and can disappear quickly too so you have to read and react fast.<br/></p>\n<p>To win you have to reach full intimacy (shown by having the area behind Karen completely purple). You only really lose by quitting since even when your intimacy falls to zero you can always build it up again.</p>\n<p>The game contains NSFW\u00a0 content, which is to say some sex and nudity if you win. I'm the first to admit that my drawing skills are rudimentary and my animating skills are worse. So it's not as graphic as some games. Still, don't play it with your grandmother nearby.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T03:43:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a24/a24d063ed8d298d0ec5f905b391fc927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JaminTheSandwich"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
