Clear your way and your enemies in maze-like levels and be the last one to stay alive while the safe place is getting smaller!<br/><br/><h3>Tactical Hamster on the rise</h3>One of the keys to victory is not to rush things, but to observe and play mindfully! Gathering the<strong> power-ups and pick up items </strong>scattered around the map is a great way to secure victory. Get enhanced abilities by becoming<strong> a vampire or a zombie, </strong>or throw the classical banana peel to doom your enemies to a fateful end.<h3>Evolve from hamsters to even cuter creatures</h3>You can unlock not only as your typical good boy dogs and smarty cats, but also as cute pandas, deer, foxes and even dragons! You can do so by collecting <strong>Hazelnuts</strong>, tasty collectibles that drop from blown-up tiles during each game!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T03:52:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbe/dbe213abed1951010ba389fe7bb45130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 110}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atelier 801"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Atelier 801"], "esrb_rating": null}
