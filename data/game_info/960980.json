She sees an advertisement for a certain doctor presenting a revolutionary technology for diagnosing and treating the psyche, \"G.L.A.Z.A\".<br/><br/>The heroine hesitates a little and decides to take a chance to dig into her problems and get rid of the need to drink pills. Advertising turns out to be truthful, but first she needs to go through a thorough analysis. And she herself has to dive into the wicked mind and understand the cause of all the problems. <br/><br/>Darkness, monsters, ghosts of the past and a cheerful girl-guide will help the main character along the way, but only to an extent, so that he understands the depth of her own despair.<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li>6 endings<br/></li><li>6 dozens of minutes of confusing plot<br/></li><li>6 definitions of why you can't talk to the dead</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T04:50:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/095/095dbed805d28f2ea1d4838d2a4d830b.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/hatereallys", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SasDeRider"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BRXKENVN"], "esrb_rating": null}
