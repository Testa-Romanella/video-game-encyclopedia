You must create platforms as well as block Meatyeors from attacking Space Guy by using the powers of magic!.. and your mouse.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: no actual magic is used.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Plans:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I do want to add more levels, flesh out the gaining aspect some more, redo the art, and add a big bad boss to fight, I just set a 48 time limit on myself for the game jam due to having other projects I need to work on. I'll update this as I can.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Other Info:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Ration Race was made for WeightGaming's 2021 game jam. The theme was \"hands off\" and is described as \"<em>In this Jam the player or player character can not directly interact with or control other characters. They can only interact with them through indirect means such as manipulation of the environment or general orders as an example</em>.\"</p>\n<p>I decided to go with an environment manipulation aspect that took inspiration from games like Mario, Line Rider, and Contra.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Changelog:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>V1.0: Release</p>\n<p>V1.1: Added respawn on falling</p>\n<p>V1.2: Made level 1 Easy (shorter, less enemies), made level 2 Medium (Shorter). Fixed Meatyeors connecting through light trails. Improved main menu QoL<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T07:56:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/097/097294837d5747caf483427b069d864a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oceanaga"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
