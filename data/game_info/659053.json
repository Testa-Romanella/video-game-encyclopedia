The game is played in two teams of four players that must work together to control their ship. The goal of the game is to be the first team to reach 400 points by sinking the opposing teams ship and by controlling capture points placed around the map.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>There were 9 people in the team working on Starboard and\u00a0I was mostly focused on gameplay and UI programming. Starboard was my first time working on a networked game and my position as gameplay programmer gave me plenty of valuable experience in writing code that does not desync or cause lag. Starboard uses Mirror Networking\u00a0which helped us greatly in getting started on the networking and getting a playable prototype ready incredibly early. I belive this contributed grealty to the project as it showed that we would be able to pull of this quite ambitous task.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T10:58:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/753/753480fe5b4fea8b64d7084feb976669.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Didenb\u00e4ck"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
