You appear on a randomly-generated map where you also have a lot of enemies, locations, and buildings with loot. Your task is to become strong enough to track down and destroy the two most powerful mutant monsters, but it's not as easy as it may seem. The game is made in a nice retro style and pixel graphics. Have a good game :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T02:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b5/2b56102681b71cac762f25a9baef7da2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fisash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
