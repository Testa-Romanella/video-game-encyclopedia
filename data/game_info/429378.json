When you collect every point in the map you can go to the next level.</p>\n<p>Actualy the game has a menu, levels, and game over systems allready finished, and some other mechanichs witch i'm thinking add in future builds such as difficult level.</p>\n<p>During the early access phase, i'm publishing some builds for free (but you can donate if you wish, I won't get mad)\u00a0 for people to test and give feedback. When the project is concluded it will be available for purchase for the minimum price.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff764ff9dfde18a582e0472681e77b6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["WizardGt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
