It's a stealth game and a dress up game combined. The game heavily draws upon my own experiences with being trans, and is not reflective of anyone else.\u00a0It is a short experience I created for my Senior Capstone at NYU. The game requires a Keyboard and Mouse to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tess\u00a0Leiman: http://tessleiman.com\u00a0</p>\n<p>Patrick Geeting:\u00a0https://patrickgeeting.wixsite.com/home</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T04:08:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba5fed1b7bb20b4889e9ccf2c45458da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tess Leiman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
