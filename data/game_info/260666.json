You are all well equipped with the latest generation beam rifles, a pack of proton grenades and our top of the line Newtonian fade device, that allows the user to use its applied momentum to fade and avoid bullets, so surviving should not be a problem. However, there isn\u2019t enough space on the transport ship to get you all to safety, only the bravest warrior will be saved, so if you can prove your worth, you may leave the planet.</p>\n<p>Best of luck, and May the Impulse over time be with you.</p>\r\nGameplay \r\n<p>Start with up to 4 players fight for the high ground.
