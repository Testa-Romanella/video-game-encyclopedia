My message behind this game is that it isn't easy to become wise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This ball running around chasing the books is you. The book is the knowledge and you need to chase them and work to get the knowledge. There is also always something that will have false information and you should watch out for it. This false information could get you in big trouble and give you long term problems.</p>\n<p>The limitation was weight so... I decided to let the books fall freely with their weight. I am not the most creative person but I hope this works.</p>\n<p>Use the W and S keys or the arrows to move around.</p>\n<p>I really look forward on further developing this game and eventually release it for android. Currently that won't be an option because of school.\u00a0 The game doesn't have all the features I would like it to have but that's for another time.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T05:11:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39c/39cb5395c01106bf0402e99d94cc099e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jon01234"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
