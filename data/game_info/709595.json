Like difficulty settings. And refining some sprites. And textures for the entire second half of the map.<br/>Well, things to implement if I do post-jam updates. Might as well get this out there and see if folks like the base gameplay to begin with.</p>\n<p>Play as a mysterious former sekitori, a sumo wrestler with the ringname of Onigawara, who has left the ring for unknown reasons and now seeks out scenes of supposed hauntings and supernatural influence. One such scene is an old temple not too far off from the shoreline, the Shrine of Heretics. With years of training under his belt and some new powers, he sets on out to see what's there...</p>\n<p>Blatantly inspired by Punch-Out! and the many myriad of indie games influenced by Punch-Out! (most particularly Megaman 8-Bit Deathmatch), the Exorfist is a first-person slapper where the goal is simple: Defeat your opponent. You can do this one of two ways, either by A: repeatedly knocking them back with each hit, eventually shoving them off the arena, or B: whittling their health down to critical and then banishing them with the eponymous Exorfist. But be careful, because the enemies will very well be trying to do the same to you.</p>\n<p>Designed as a way for me to push against my artistic boundaries, I wanted to create a game where I had to draw a lot of stuff. And boy howdy, did I draw a lot of stuff. It was tough. And it was painful. But I had a lot of fun.<br/></p>\n<p>Pick up the phone, call 1-800-R-U-SLAPN, and get into the action today!</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/>- Three whole enemies!
