With 5 unique factions and 10 cards on the table at once, things can get out of hand before you can say \"I think things have gotten out of hand\". Combine cards with the same faction or character to boost their stat bonus. Draw new cards to fortify your deck and make unstoppable combos. Defeat increasingly difficult bosses and go on an idle winstreak rampage. Feeling lazy and still want to be rewarded? Stock up on rare cards and sit back as enemy after enemy falls at your feet. Toggle the game speed option to defeat your opponents 3x as fast. Do you have what it takes to do very little and gain so much?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T06:10:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39da1939ac0430bd5036f7d9bf889dce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DCAtkinsonGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
