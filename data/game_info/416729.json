The player pilots a spaceship through various worlds whileavoiding projectiles and other menacing spacecrafts with each level/world culminating in aboss battle that tests the players skills acquired along the way. Perseverance is the key facet of the game asdying means the player respawns at the very\u00a0 beginning of the level. Although the main focus of the game is to\u00a0 circumvent obstacles, there are various power ups that can be obtained\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0throughout each level that adds effective tools to the spaceship that the player has to use carefully as they are limited. These powerups provide\u00a0 utilitarian applications to the player. As these power ups are scarce using\u00a0 them requires a layer of strategy to it.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0The gameplay elements in ASTRALMAYHEM have aneasy to pick up but\u00a0 hard to master approach that is fun and exciting, invoking a sense of nostalgia for classic game design.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:46:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f76/f762f4fee97cf7cd246f2fa6feed08a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kosmikrage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
