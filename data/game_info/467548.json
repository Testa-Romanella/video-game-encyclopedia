So be careful what you use them for. CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste affect not only the regular floor tiles but also duplicate the VOID surrounding the broken paths. Special Tiles like the END, LAVA, PICK UPS and the ROBOT itself can't be pasted or overwritten.</p>\n<p>What about the lava, you say?`</p>\n<p>Sometimes the floor is LAVA and it spreads each time you move the little robot.</p>\n\n<p>Some levels come with additional CTRL keys to collect, when you walk over them.</p>\n\n<p>Now you know everything you need to solve this little puzzle game!<br/></p>\n<p>Good Luck and don't lose control!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:52:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ce59538be7a6f4380b788809f7cf8c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["littleBugHunter", "Laura", "IndieBurg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
