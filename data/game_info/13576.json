This is the right project to start your acquaintance with VR or receive new VR impressions. The game is focused on Virtual Reality but you can play just fine without a set.<br />\nReady steady go!<br />\nThanks to all robot-gods out there we will not take this journey alone - \u200aour humble (with a tiny control-everyone mania) assistant is waiting for us (she is so sweet, isn\u2019t she?). The Most Excellent Assistant Zero-Seven (she said that humans may refer to her simply as \u2018Your Highness\u2019). So the player\u2019s task is to impress TMEAR07 with experiment on volunteer to unlock new healing technology for humanity. The problem is she doesn\u2019t believe in that possibility because humans are simple and illogical (and she is genius\u2026 as always).<br />\nTo cure our volunteer Mrs. Jane Smith and impress TMEAR07\u200a\u200aplayers must select the right way through the objects (organelles) to the cell\u2019s nucleus and do their best in innovative radial racings between selected objects. Each object provides unique abilities to improve racing params or to protect cell with different strategies.<br />\nHow is it going inside the cell?<br />\nGetting closer to understanding cell structure and organelles functions (which are similar to the real functionality of the organelles) players will improve their skills and will have a chance to impress completely suspicious The Most Excellent Assistant Zero-Seven (who knows why is she so much aware of the other six Excellent Assistant Robots disassembling\u2026).<br />\nOne old and wise robot (he is still remember his 386 childhood) said that it\u2019s a bad idea to make this kind of girl-robot sad\u2026<br />\nFeaturesPlayable with VR (control the movement with your head only, or use keyboard and joystick).<br />\nSolve the riddle of TMEAR07, find out why doesn\u2019t she believe in the humanity (may be it is just robot\u2019s bad today or some silicon stuff inside your PC makes she sad)?<br />\nWith each new start the cell structure will be generated anew placing the organelles in different locations.<br />\nThis game is a perfect opportunity to learn more about cell microstructure, different organelles and their roles in cell vital activity.<br />\nUnlock harder difficulties where the true challenge awaits.<br />\nHot keysSpace - recenter camera position in VR mode<br />\nM - switch mirroring VR picture on monitor<br />\nEsc - pause and options menu<br />\nF5 - hide or show UI<br />\nF6 - hide or show bathyscaphe<br />\nF1 - graphics for recommended hardware<br />\nF2 - graphics for older hardware<br />\nF3 - decrease rotation speed (highly not recommended, only for experienced VR players)<br />\nF4 - increase rotation speed (highly not recommended, only for experienced VR players)<br />\nF7 - reset rotation speed to defaultKnown issuesVR on Linux is not yet implemented<br />\nIf you are not using gamepad you may want to plug it off to switch game in mouse/keyboard control mode.Other VR games by Luden.io<br />\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/522220/<br />\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/588560/<br />\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/343740/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T03:50:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc1/bc110e458ce0fae2af903be92964cac9.jpg", "website": "http://incell.nivalvr.com/", "rating": 2.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 300, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 476, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["Nival Interactive", "Luden.io"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Educational", "Family", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nival"], "esrb_rating": null}
