The famous rock guitar with his mission: to bring Rock'n Roll into the world!!! But the gang of bad asses: Beethoven, Chopin and Mozart want to stop our little fellow...Our guitar hero has to fight against the classical instrumental stormtroops, before he faces the violent maestros... Mike is brave, but be careful, not to loose sustain. Every time he touches an enemy or the environment he will loose sustain and faith in himself. But harmony heaven is graceful.
