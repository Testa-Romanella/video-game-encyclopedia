With only WASD / Arrow Keys allowed, I got the idea of the gameplay from the most direct translation I have of Summit:\u00a0the top, or peak of something.</p>\n<p>So I created a climbing game, where a bird character climbs on the walls of a cave through a series of levels to reach the peak of the mountain and enjoy the view. You only regenerate stamina from standing on the ground, so if you touch a spike or bat as you climb and run out, you'll fall!</p>\n<p>I made all the sprites myself, using a Gameboy style palette because I think it looks nice and I have less problems choosing colors with the limitations. I actually really like the bird character I created, they looks very chill.</p>\n<p>I also made all music tracks and sound effects with BOSCA CEOIL. I\u00a0hadn't previously tried to add music to my projects myself, so I am proud of the results I had with this attempt.</p>\n<p>Overall, I'm proud of this project. I playtested it myself and hope everyone else enjoys it too - no matter what rating I get, I enjoy the feeling of finishing a game I enjoyed making. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:59:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b64eeec953632128c04b993d35b7ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KaaSnake"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
