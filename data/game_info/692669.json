This forms the core of the cooking experience that you must master in order to become the very best chef in Ambrosia.<br />\nDish synergy and ingredient properties combine with a dynamic recipe creation system, meaning that you can experiment with thousands of different combinations to create a unique menu of decadent delights. Serving Rats with Tomatoes and Potatoes? Don&#39;t you mean Tomato Souffl\u00e9 and Vermin Slices in Starchy Cream?!<br />\nTake on bitter rival chefs in epic culinary clashes to see who is crowned cooking king of Ambrosia! Dishes are scored on a variety of things from ingredients, to flavours, strength and more, with no two judges having the same taste. Become an even greater chef by utilising the addition of sauces to alter the properties of your dishes and influence the judges to win their favour.<br />\nLive off your land by growing foods such as fruit and vegetables, gather resources to craft specialised machinery that can process your ingredients further, and even create new recipe components whilst you tend to an eclectic mix of animal livestock from cows to unicorns! And don&#39;t forget to repair and customise your dilapidated (and slightly haunted) villa!<br />\nWelcome to Ambrosia, a place of gastronomic delight and agriculture wonder, renowned the world over. You are free to explore all that Ambrosia has to offer, from winding narrow streets to lush green fields, from quaint restaurants to bustling taverns, all full to the brim with &#39;friendly&#39; locals eager to meet you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-02T07:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b46/b46912034e3c991f6cfd51017a975484.jpg", "website": "https://www.team17.com/games/epic-chef/", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 551, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 132, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 428, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Infinigon Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
