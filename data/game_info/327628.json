Theme was \"Czas Bohatera\" (Time of Hero). An objective is to save all prisoners on time. Collect keys scattered around the level in order to free them but be careful not to waste them on unused cages. Gamejam version includes only 1 playable level. Available for Windows, Linux and HTML5. I'm planning to port this game to Android aswell.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>https://jfxr.frozenfractal.com -\u00a0 randomly generated Sound Effects</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/4-chiptunes-adventure - 2 BGMs<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>Left</strong> - Left Arrow or A</p>\n<p><strong>Right</strong> - Right Arrow or D</p>\n<p><strong>Jump</strong> - Up Arrow or W or Spacebar</p><p>If you are interested in source code, feel free to see it: https://github.com/Kiel97/bialjam2019<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-14T03:57:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c8/0c8dbf9177205fbae65f6e6a0208b762.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Kiel97"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
