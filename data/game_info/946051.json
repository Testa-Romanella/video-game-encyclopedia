Use their individual skills to open paths for the other, or merge together to unlock a new range of possibilities.\r\n  </p>\n<p>While combined, the single character can use the abilities of the two, and gains access to their own unique ability. While separate, the player can freely swap between who they are controlling to make use of whichever set of skills is needed.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>A work in progress of my Senior Thesis project. More updates coming soon!
