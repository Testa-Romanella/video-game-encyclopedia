While the game is split into episodes that were released as separate titles, it has a single plot: Hector investigates the case that can be solved only with his unconventional methods.</p>\n<p>The story starts with Hector holding negotiations with a terrorist who took hostages. The sniper wants the protagonist to complete quests around the town. These missions are quite humorous and include such tasks as fixing the town clock and shutting down a pornography store. Because of such humor the game with 2D cartoonish graphics is not allowed for kids. </p>\n<p>Hector features point-and-click gameplay with a heavy focus on dialogues and less - on puzzle solving. Not all solutions in the game are obvious but, as a rule, you don\u2019t have many items to use so variations of your actions are quite limited. Another situation is with dialogues: choosing the right lines simplifies completing quests, as Hector can solve almost any problem talking to other characters in a suitable manner.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2011-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-29T20:42:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/6051912c710bef83cb1923281fe9aea8.jpg", "website": "http://www.telltalegames.com/hector", "rating": 2.48, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 76, "owned": 1382, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 15}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 44, "suggestions_count": 399, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 44, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Straandlooper"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
