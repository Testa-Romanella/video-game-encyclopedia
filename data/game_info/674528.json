It's a simple platformer game featuring coins,\u00a0moving platforms and stuff that kills you :D</p>\n\n<p>Play using WASD/ Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>What to expect:</p>\n<p>It starts off easy but it becomes really challenging after a while, you will have to get used to the 'feel' of the game.</p>\n<p>The audio gives a really happy vibe that is contagious (at least it was for me)</p>\n<p>Bugs may appear and may vary. (please report them to me)</p>\n<p>The collisions are not perfect, you may run into stuff like the main character jumping away from a wall that was too close to him or getting stuck in the floor for a bit ( the latter is usually solved by waiting a second and jumping)</p>\n\n<p>The asset pack used for the game was taken from the Unity Asset Store for free (you've probably seen it in other games). Credits to Bayat Games for a nice and easy to use Asset Pack.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy this small game. I'm learning more and more with every little project I take on, and this was a blast to make.</p>\n<p>Be sure to let me know how your experience was, I'm open to constructive feedback. Also, again, if you run into bugs, let me know!</p>\n\n<p>Have a good one!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T05:11:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b95/b958fc185c576c6acb2f3edb8fb5765a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["What My Feather"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
