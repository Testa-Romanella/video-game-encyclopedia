BEWARE however, for if you shoot too many of your own sheep you'll lose the game! (edited)</p>\n<p>play as a Wolf, hide yourself among the rest of the sheep, transition to your true form to feast of the other sheep, WATCH OUT however the shepherd will be hot on your heels, one shot from him and you're out! The game ends either when the shepherd finds out all the Wolves or the Wolves eat most of the sheep!</p>\n\n\n<p>Development Team:</p>\n<p>Ben Programmer:\u00a0https://frozenwispstudios.github.io/Portfolio/<br/></p>\n<p>Mike Programmer:\u00a0https://minwater2.github.io/</p>\n<p>Kees Programmer:\u00a0https://soggykees.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Renee Artist:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/evil.renee/</p>\n<p>Kent Artist:https://www.artstation.com/kentverbeet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T11:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4a/d4af01b9ce06b8024f43f125edc229ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["frozenwispstudios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
