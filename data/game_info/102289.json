He was a musician\u00a0 who loved making music, and I wanted to honor him in my own special way!</p>\n<p>Story:<br/></p>\n<p>Tom Rizzo was traveling around in his Psychedelevator, trying to find a new place to chill out, when OH NO! HE FELL OUT! Now he has to make his way across the island to get back to the psychedelevator so he can get home! Platform your way across 2 demo levels with music composed by my uncle, and collect the rune\u00a0stones to complete each level!</p>\n<p>Includes the PC game and a Dreamcast CDI disc image to burn (compatible with imgburn)!</p>\n<p>Uses the Darkplaces (PC) and Makaqu (Dreamcast) Quake Engine</p>\n<p>Dreamcast version playable in the Demul Dreamcast emulator!</p>\n<p>Screenshots are from PC version of the game. Dreamcast gameplay can be found in the video.</p>\n<p>External Reviews:</p>\n<p>\"Works great and was pretty fun really enjoy the music\u00a0<br/>Bravo on a great start! Keep up the good work! I bet this can make an interesting and chill game to sit with.\" - TacT, Dreamcast-Talk Forums</p>\n<p>\"Thank you very much for your work, I tested it on my DC and the demo is AWESOME. Some features I would like to highlight:<br/>1) Soundtrack is great and fits the game very well. Tom definitely was a great musician\u00a0<br/>2) Controller is very precise. I have tried some third-person games made with first-person engines (mostly Doom engine) and controllers were not good, so I wasn't expecting much from this... but it actually worked very nice with Dreamcast analog. Kudos!\" - TuxTheWise, Dreamcast-Talk Forums</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0b/a0bf36ee1faae3fe828ccf8dcb2e5b91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreameater Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
