A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. <br/>____________________________________ <br/><br/>SUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/<br/>VISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   <br/>FOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T16:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b815de277b04a5dd1738f8bc3f2451e.jpg", "website": "http://en.ratrodstudio.com/games/driftmania2/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Maple Media Holdings", "Ratrod Studio", "Maple Media"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Maple Media Holdings", "Ratrod Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
