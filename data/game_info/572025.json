We're planning on working on it more.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Use Arrow keys or numpad to move. Use the mouse or number keys to select items and actions from your inventory. You will need to press a movement key after selecting an item or action to indicate where you would like to use that item or action. That means you need to \"Use\" on the stairs to climb them.<br/></p><p>Echo Down is made by Ash McAllan, Keith Evans, and Clover Greenhalgh and is partially inspired by Moirai by Chris Johnson.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T04:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ca/1cad3bae810a5a794f03733717bccdd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["KaynSD", "acegiak", "CuddlyClover"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
