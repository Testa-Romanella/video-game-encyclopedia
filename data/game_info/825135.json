If all spaces of the shape of the middle die are filled with different color dice, you receive points\u00a0 equal to the value of the middle die. If there are two or more identical dice, you lose points equal to the value of the middle die. There are about 30 dice, and the game ends when you run out of dice. An example:</p>\n<p>All 4 dice that make up the middle 4's shape are DIFFERENT. You'll get 4 points.</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 dice that\u00a0are IDENTICAL (they're both 8s) within the 4's shape. You'll get -4 points.</p>\n\n<p>Deleting one of those 8s will stop the penalty.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing my game. Bugs are expected.\u00a0Share your high score if you want and I will use the highest score as a screenshot!<br/></p>\n<p>(VERY SORRY ABOUT THE JARRING COMPUTER-GENERATED MUSIC.
