See how quickly you can serve as many people as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt includes an arcade mode with three difficulty settings, and a tutorial, which shows you how to play and make all the different drinks. For each difficulty mode, the number of different drinks that the customers asks for increases. In the easiest mode, all they want is Whisky, Wine, and Beer. In the hardest mode, you have a six bottle bar, and they will ask for more complicated cocktails. The tutorial is three parts. It will step you through all the mechanics of the game, and how to make every drink.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI designed and programmed this game as a passion project. I'm so grateful to all the artists who invested their effort in making the graphics and audio so great.
