In 1876, a group of local amateur spelunkers traversed a majority of these caves before disappearing with little trace, except for their discarded notes. Your job is to pick up where they left off, collect their lost notes, and see what the rest of this cave has to offer. Locals say that the caves are haunted, both with the souls of the lost travelers, but additionally with the scourge of Lord Malekai: a long-dead lord of the nearby town who was notorious for his brutality towards the locals and his serfs. <em>A little curse never stopped you, however.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T08:04:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/837/837dc49551b99920381afb7acd0e3fce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["attackzach"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
