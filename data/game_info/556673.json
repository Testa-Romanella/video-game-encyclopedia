Taken by curiosity she walks toward the interior of that dark passage.</p>\n<p>On the other side she discovers a magic stone that teleports her to a secret garden in front of a large tower. In the garden several challenges and only one way to get back home: play and win.</p>\n<p>Ditto's Challenges are focused in microgames(short minigames). The player will have a time limit to beat them (like WarioWare). This game is inspired by WarioWare, Mario Party and others.
