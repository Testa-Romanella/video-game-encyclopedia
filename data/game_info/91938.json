As an upperclassman\u2014a senpai\u2014there is a rule amongst your kouhais which shadows your every move:\u00a0<em>Senpai will never notice you.</em></p>\n<p>How will you interact with your kouhais? Notice them, ignore them, string them along? The choice is up to you!</p>\n\n<p><em>Senpai Simulator</em>\u00a0was inspired by a\u00a0certain popular meme. Unlike with\u00a0last year\u2019s game, I don\u2019t remember exactly how or why the idea popped into my head.</p>\n<p>However, one thing I was sure of was that I wanted to use a different game engine this time.\u00a0Ren\u2019Py\u00a0was amongst my top candidates, so a visual novel, dating sim, and/or life sim was in strong consideration from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Beyond the basic premise, one prominent source of inspiration was the Pokemon series. I was playing\u00a0<em>Pokemon X</em>\u00a0around the time that I began actual work on this game, and its influence is obvious in the design and presentation of a certain character.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy\u00a0this second special Brainscraps Holiday Card, and Happy Holidays!</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Crude backgrounds and manga-inspired character art!<br/>\u2022 An even more crude original soundtrack!
