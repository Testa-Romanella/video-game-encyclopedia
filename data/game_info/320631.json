A beam of shimmering light hit the ground and started pulling up the sheep inhabitants of the farm. The poor sheep woke up to find themselves hovering inside transparent tubes in a strange room. It\u2019s not clear what happened after that, but the lights went off and the sheep managed to escape from their prison. And that is when the dangerous adventures of these earthly creatures begin on an extraterrestrial spaceship speeding through the interstellar darkness. How can you help the sheep?<br/><br/>Do you want to hear the truth? Aren\u2019t you afraid to get disappointed in these cute little balls of white fur? If you keep reading it, don\u2019t complain \u2013 I warned you! So the big news is that these sheep are silly! Actually, they are very, very silly \u2013 they have lost the very little of what could be called their mind before the abduction. Now all they can do is to run, probably due to shock and a sudden change of familiar settings. Even their instinct of self-preservation is gone, so they can easily fall of a platform or jump into the tentacles of an alien monster who couldn\u2019t wish for more than that. Simply put, these creatures are real troublemakers. Perhaps, the aliens abducted them to study stupidity in its purest form. But why did they choose sheep with their vulnerable and delicate psyche? Anyway, earthlings never leave anyone in trouble. We won\u2019t let aliens steal our dumb sheep! Let\u2019s do our best to save them! To do that, we\u2019ll need to arrange arrows on platforms to point the sheep in the direction of teleports. It\u2019s strange that the aliens did not turn them off - this very fact questions their own intellectual capabilities. Freedom to the sheep of the Earth!<br/><br/>- 20 dynamic levels.<br/>- Levels with different completion modes.<br/>- One vicious boss.<br/>- Diverse obstacles.<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UroT46YBQks<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ_RbEzACUA", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:39:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31f/31fb690ffc178873f0a06f8ef9d67b28.jpg", "website": "http://www.ladiagroup.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Ladia Group"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Aleksandr Datsko"], "esrb_rating": null}
