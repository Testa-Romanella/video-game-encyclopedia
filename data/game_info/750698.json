I intend to make a game every week, picking from many different styles and genres, and release it at the end, no matter how crappy it is. The goal is to release a lot of different prototypes, see what I enjoy, see what I don't and possibly pick a couple of ideas to develop further. This is the result of the first week. It's a straight Asteroids clone, with some features missing, but the core loop is in, and with pretty cool vector graphics (used even for text). \u00a0I used microStudio, a really cool browser-based development environment and engine, which allowed me to code most of the game on an old and crusty, but very light, compact and quiet chromebook. <br/></p><p>Enjoy! It's pretty sleek, if I say so myself :-P<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/044/044c177d320543807fb28200836a9664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["President of Space"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
