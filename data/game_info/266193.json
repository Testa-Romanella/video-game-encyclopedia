{"id": 266193, "slug": "mind-mirror", "name": "Mind Mirror", "name_original": "Mind Mirror", "description": "<p>Timothy Leary\u2019s Mind Mirror is software program that Tim created with Bob Dietz and Peter Van den Beemt back in 1985. It runs on the IBM PC with a CGA graphics card in 4 color mode, on the Apple II, and on the Commodore 64. It requires a floppy drive. It was published by Electronic Arts and sold about 65,000 copies over the course of about two years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EA wanted to capitalize upon the good doctor\u2019s wild &amp; zany notoriety, and Tim obliged. It is based on Tim\u2019s work on psycho-metrics from the 1950\u2019s and allows users to define, compare and role play personalities. One of the most innovative ideas about the program is that role playing someone else will teach you about yourself and others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The limitations of the 1985 computers forced many compromises on the presentation of the text and graphics. Electronic Arts abandoned the program many years ago and Timothy\u2019s Estate recently sold its rights in Mind Mirror to the original developers and programmers. They are working with Edward Craig, who has licensed the product, to extend its capabilities to modern computers and the Internet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/702/702582de9bc1553047f1ef928d44ae88.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/MindMirrorGame", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "Atari 8-bit", "Apple II", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["BigFrog Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "BigFrog Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
