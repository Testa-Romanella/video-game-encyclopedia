Search for all masks - matching every character.\r\n  2. Find the right house for each player.\r\n  \r\nThere are always four figures in the game:\r\n(yellow, red, purple, black)  \r\nJoin a group of up to five players and complete the task. \r\nBut it is not as easy as it looks. Each player can move any piece at the same time! \r\nHowever, only a limited number of movement options are available to each player! \r\nOnly as a team can you complete the task!\r\nSource code is available on GitHub: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/TobseF/RoguyIsleMaze\"&gt;RoguyIsleMaze&lt;/a&gt;\r\nMultiplayer\r\nPlay in a team with up to five players.
