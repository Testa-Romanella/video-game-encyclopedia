But there is one problem. You are a bug, and you are too small to reach all the controls. And the strange radiation on the ship is causing some kind of mutation.</p>\n<p>Survive 9 hyperspace jumps to get back to your home planet to warn them about the invasion before it's too late!<br/></p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD to move.</li><li>Right click to dash.</li><li>Left click to attack.</li><li>R to restart.</li><li>Escape to menu.</li><li>M to toggle music.</li><li>N to change music volume.</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>All assets are our own. :)<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Programming and Game Design by Alex003.\r\n    </li><li>Sound Design and Composing by Colton Vanhooren.

The final product is absolutely nothing like the original idea. But it turned into something cool and we're happy with what we made.</p><p>There were several ideas we couldn't implement due to the time constraint, like more levels and endless mode. These might be added later. By all other accounts, the game is finished.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T14:41:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/636/6361c5cfded72f4e2f47c049cfa0853f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex003", "TheHibiscusPoet", "silverdesign"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
