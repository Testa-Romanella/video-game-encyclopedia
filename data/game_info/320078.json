{"id": 320078, "slug": "mayas-dice", "name": "Maya's Dice (itch)", "name_original": "Maya's Dice (itch)", "description": "<p><strong><em>Maya\u2019s Dice</em></strong> is a game that takes heavy influence from classic RPGs from the 80s, 90s, and early 00s, as well as newer games that use this style to tell unique stories. We have a fascination with more traditional and basic game materials, such as cards and dice, as well as worldbuilding and storytelling in games. <em>Maya\u2019s Dice</em> does both, taking influence from games such as<em> To the Moon</em>,<em> Undertale</em>, <em>Fortune-499</em>, and <em>Dicey Dungeons</em>.</p>\n<p>The story of <em>Maya\u2019s Dice</em> is one that is set in the future, but in a time that is not too far off from our own. It exists in a future that is not too far-fetched, and puts front and center what many nowadays feel are the potential downfalls of modern-day technology. It grabs themes from science fiction books and films of the late 20th century, as well as those from late-20th century and early 21st century RPGs.</p>\n<p>Using Liar\u2019s Dice as a benchmark throughout the game, players delve deeper and deeper into the world of the game, and learn more about those that are impacting it. As players continue to explore, they begin to question who the true antagonists of the game are.</p>\n<p>The visual style of <em>Maya\u2019s Dice</em> reflects a retro-cyberpunk atmosphere, the pixel style chosen as an homage to the early RPGs. The environment and machinery are purposefully drawn in cool, pantone colors to evoke the cold, indifferent and unsympathetic world that the characters inhabit, while the characters are rendered in different degrees of warmer tones to reflect their individual humanity. The beginning cutscenes are a throwback to film noir and a love letter to <em>Blader Runner</em>. Many of the background textures and style of machinery was directly inspired by old arcade games such as the MegaMan series, while some of the character designs such as the government agents harken back to the older days of <em>Men In Black</em>. As lovers of sci-fi, we try to capture in our visual style some colorful playfulness and vibrancy of older sci-fi.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T07:15:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ab/5abf1506b0cf89cfb2073e105fac9685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jonah Gaynor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
