After that, the players switch roles and it starts all over again.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first ever game jam game and also my first ever game finished and released to the public. It's small but I'm still proud of it. :) I hope you enjoy and have a little fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T04:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f5/9f5e79495832bc0c434f316733d9d431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ellie Braccini"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
