Can you handle the pressure, or will you fail miserably in a big bankruptcy?</strong><br/><br/>As the owner and manager you have a lot of responsibilities on a daily basis.<br/><br/>You must:Choose the direction of your storeShould it be a Shoe Store for the fashionable type, an Electronics Store for your everyday needs, or a giant Hypermarket that sells a bit of everything? Not everything will work. Trying to sell high-fashion, high-priced items in the poor part of town will not generate endless queues at your register. Will you try to dominate a competitive market, or go in an unexplored direction.Control the article flowFor an article to be taken home by a customer, a lot of things must be taken care of. First you must select and order the articles. For a delivery to take place, the storage space must be able to receive and handle the delivered articles. The sales area must have the right displays and registers to showcase and sell the articles. Building a good relationship with your suppliers is key to be able to sell their more exclusive items. Oh, and by the way, which article should be the first for your customers to see when they enter your store? The bulk selling jeans, or the hyped silk shirt?Get people inside your storeBuild your reputation among your customers, and make your store the most sought after in town. A good marketing scheme, along with happy customers will work wonders for your income. But don't oversell your idea. If you can't keep what you promise, the customers will leave the store dissatisfied, and nothing ruins a store quicker than unhappy customers.Please the customerCreate an enjoyable atmosphere for your customers to shop in, and theme your store, so they will know it is YOUR store they have entered. Make sure they receive the help they need, and that the lines for the registers don't grow too long. Manage the in-store marketing, so that both the fashionistas and the discount-hunters knows where to go, and which article to pick.Manage your personnelWhen you have too much on your plate to handle yourself, it might be the time for you to get some staff. Find interesting candidates among the applications. Conduct interviews, get a feel for the person, and decide if they match the role you need taken care of. Negotiate their salary and hire them. Keep them happy, and make sure they are not overworked. A great working climate gives great dedication. But you still need to sort the slackers from the workers. Invest time in the right persons, and train them to become better so when you need a stand-in for yourself, when you move to the next store, you can pick from your own home-grown talents.Optimize the storeThe difference between a good store and a great store lies in the detail. Weed out the poor selling articles, and get more of the good ones. Make sure you don't order unnecessarily many articles, but still enough that you don't run out. Optimize the prizes to increase the income. Find the customer patterns and adjust the opening hours accordingly. Plan an efficient staff schedule, so you don't pay people for doing nothing.Prepare for big eventsIs a VIP coming? Christmas soon? Black Friday? Can you spot the next big trend before anyone else? Adjust your actions according to the events occurring in a dynamic city that changes day by day. <br/><br/>All of this is is just an ordinary day as a store owner.<br/><br/>Are you ready to take on the challenge? If yes, then King of Retail is the game for you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49d/49d42300216e2efe3012694a0d0cb01d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 26, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Freaking Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Iceberg Interactive", "Freaking Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
