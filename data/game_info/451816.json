As you are fighting agains yourself, the game has no Game Over, every time you lost, you have to defeat the last boss again.</p>\n<p>You don't have a life bar too, you and the boss share some\u00a0kind of \"tug of war\", every time you hit the boss you put this \"tug of war\" to one side and every time you get hitted the boss put it in the other side. Who puts this \"tug of war\" completely to the opposite side wins.</p>\n<p>My idea is continue the development of this project in order to release it as a full game in the future.
