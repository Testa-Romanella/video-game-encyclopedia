You can also collect wood oil cans to reduce the timer, how fast can you complete all 10 levels?</p>\n<p>Try to avoid all the pitfalls and obstacles of day to day life as you try to roll yourself back to your cozy living room, sorrounded by all your chair friends!</p>\n<p>The oil cans look tempting, but if you take too long to take them it might not be worth it! They are in alternate paths a bit above the ground, so going low might be the safe bet.</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Programmers: Vitor Milioni, Bruno Zisman\r\n</p>\n<p>Artist: Ian Victor de Souza\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and sound effects: Vitor Milioni\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T12:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b50/b5015f04d6fc43e5fdafd062d20072bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vitor Milioni", "Ianvds", "brunozisman"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
