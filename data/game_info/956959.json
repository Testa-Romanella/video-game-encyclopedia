My best record is 32.854 seconds, see if you can beat it!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>W, A, S, D - movement</p>\n<p>Left mouse button - shoot</p>\n<p>Right mouse button - turn on/off flashlight</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0- There is an arrow above your head that points to the exit. When you don't know where you are, take a quick look up to find your way to the exit. Be aware that you have to turn on your flashlight to see it. (I haven't found a way to include it as a part of the UI, so you're gonna have to deal with it for now.)</p>\n<p>- The enemy cannot be killed, only pushed back. Shoot it to push it back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T17:24:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93c/93cac4157473c8aafd1bf9fa1afc6289.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Housayn Raffea"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
