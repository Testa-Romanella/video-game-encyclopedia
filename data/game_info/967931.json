It's best experienced with a gamepad and headphones.<h3>A different breed of Snake</h3>Outrun, outsmart, and eat your opponents. Move backwards, strafe sideways, and turn freely. Collect power-ups which taunt, instill fear, and grant stability.<h3>Improve your high score</h3>Earn points for captures and longevity. Purposely lose encounters\u2014and manage the ensuing chaos\u2014to pad your highest score yet.<h3>An accessible experience</h3>Wurmus provides high visual contrast, binaural audio cues, and screen reader support.
