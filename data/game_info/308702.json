{"id": 308702, "slug": "diskmania", "name": "DISKMANIA", "name_original": "DISKMANIA", "description": "<p>Diskmania is a fast paced, 2-player arcade sports game inspired by hockey. It was made for the Rapid Prototyping class in the Game Programming - Bachelor of Software Engineering course in MDS in New Zealand, with the restrictions of it having to run on a low powered PC serving as an arcade, with a fixed resolution of 1280x1024, and only being able to use movement keys, start button and 2 action buttons for each player.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to score more goals than your opponent before time runs out. To do this, you take control of a puck that spins around you, and that you can fire at any time. You can also dash to move faster, or to steal the puck from the other player. To help you (or hurt you) with scoring, you can collect powerups such as bigger goals, or more pucks on the field.</p>\n\n\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n\n<p>Player 1:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> to move</li><li><strong>J</strong> to shoot</li><li><strong>K</strong> to dash</li><li><strong>Enter</strong> is the start button</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrows</strong>\u00a0to move</li><li><strong>Num 0</strong> to shoot</li><li><strong>Num .</strong> to dash</li><li><strong>Num 5\u00a0</strong>is the start button</li></ul>\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nProgrammers\r\n<ul><li>@RitaRosaBapoDev</li><li>@RubenBastos\u00a0</li><li>@BrunoMatos</li></ul>\r\nArt\r\n<ul><li>@JasonHarris</li><li>@StraussWard</li></ul>\r\nSound\r\n<ul><li>@RubenBastos\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T05:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f89/f890138b0514557e2c21ec573f8d3f45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RubenBastosDev"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
