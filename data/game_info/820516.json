Use your glass-trapped Dice Dudes to fight your battles for you! You better hope you roll better than they do, or you\u2019ll lose your chance at the winner\u2019s pot!<br/></p>\n<p>Note: Just like with gambling, there\u2019s no way to win :)\r\n</p>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n\r\n<p>1. Select a Dice Dude and click a square on your side of the playing field to place the dice.\r\n</p>\n<p>2. One all Dice Dudes are placed, select a dice, and then click an opposing row to assign that dice to attack that row.\r\n</p>\n<p>3. Dice Dudes can only hit the first enemy in a row, and only the first dice dude in any row can attack.\r\n</p>\n<p>4. The top left number represents health\r\n</p>\n<p>5. The top right number is current attack strength. This gets rerolled every turn.\r\n</p>\n<p>6. Clicking a card and then clicking a Dice Dude applies the card\u2019s effects to that dice. Cards are single use and can be bought in the shop.\r\n</p>\n<p>7.
