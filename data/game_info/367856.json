I made this about 5 or 6 months ago. There is no real end state. The boss isn't really fully designed, and the enemies are broken in some respects. I am fully aware this is not good. But, I did the work, so I figured I'd let people mess with it if they really wanted to.</p>\n<p>The actual game will eventually come out, I've started a big overhaul since I finished this. Basically, you can expect the actual game to play nothing like this does, but I hope to make it look very similar\r\nCredits:\r\n@N0THANKY0UMUSIC for the music!\r\n@Cru3LJule for the tilesets!\r\nBoth can be found on twitter!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ad/9ad52452cbcea4758ae96667c2c598c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tyooo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
