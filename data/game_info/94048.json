If you've just joined us welcome, grab a pew, you've arrived at the right time.</p>\n\n<p>So we have all the technical stuff sorted, we know we're not going to have to wipe anyone's accounts in an update or two and the game has a patcher so it's easy to keep up to date.</p>\n<p>All that remains is the exciting stuff: Injecting missions, maps, vehicles, skins and weapons. Featuring so far:</p>\n<ul><li>800+ Zombies per map (grows as more Players join)</li><li>Multiplayer online (up to 24 Players per map)</li><li>Skill based leveling system</li><li>Customizable weapons</li><li>Ragdoll physics</li></ul>\n<p>So you've joined us at the right time because this is where the fun begins, you can jump into the game hopefully with a few pals and enjoy slaying Zombies and maybe give us a bit of feedback, what you liked, what you didn't and what you'd like to see more of. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We want to create something the players have jumped on board and helped to mould.</p>\n<p>It's a free to play game that won't break the bank, so if you like what you see support us by chucking a couple of dollars our way (not essential) and subscribe to the blog to keep up to date because those updates will be coming thick and fast!</p>\n<p><strong>Are you a Youtuber or Streamer who want to record Zombie Barricades?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes of course you have our permission (as if you have to ask!)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here this pack of logos and stuff might help you out.
