I wanna start off by thanking all of you for the continued support. I couldn't be happier to be making these games for you, and even with their flaws, I think they're something we can all enjoy.</p><p>This began as a simple level editor for one of my older games, Lucario Vs the World, but then I completely lost it and went all out with this passion project. <br/> I think, In my life at least, I never really get to where I intended with my art. But, this time, I'm not so sure. Before I get too pretentious and completely lose my mind, I'll get into the actual description.<br/> -----------------------<br/> Controls<br/> Help Lucario save his friend in a trippy aritstic platformer! <br/> Platforming Levels are controlled with the arrow keys.<br/> Space Shooting Levels are controlled with the arrow keys and z. You move forward automatically. Shoot the baddies before they get you!<br/> 3D Maze Levels- Move with the mouse. Find the door and click it!<br/> The Level Editor is very basic, but if you have any ideas I'll add it to an update and credit you! I also take music and graphics.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/334/33404fef1caf8b0a21d1ffd7d158507b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nickkennedy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
