You can either shift into a cat or a mouse, with the cat being able to jump and the mouse being able to crawl into small spaces. Be careful though, other cats are out to get you!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The game was inspired by the theme of superpowers, where we chose shapeshifting as our power. We believe that everyone has their own superpower and something that they're good at.
