{"id": 3468, "slug": "loadout", "name": "Loadout", "name_original": "Loadout", "description": "<p>Loadout is an arcade third-person multiplayer shooter developed by Edge Of Reality.</p>\n<p>The game focuses on over-the-top cartoon gore and dark humor. The emphasis is put on player and weaponry customization. A vast Weaponcrafting system is present, which allows players to build a weapon which suits their playstyle from scratch. The class system is absent as the developers want the players to define their own classes using the weapons of their own creation.</p>\n<p>There are no in-game paywalls, but if the player wants to unlock all the customization options or the best weapon modules, they have to either grind the in-game currency or buy it for real money.</p>\n<p>The game features 4 competitive multiplayer modes and a co-op mode where 4 players complete missions which are divided into 5 or 6 parts with each mission having a different goal. A lot of missions revolve around killing aliens known as Kroads. After each mission, the players are awarded loot boxes, in-game currency or other in-game items.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2014-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T01:47:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/560/560847de3a0fd510bbe6c305abca0f0f.jpg", "website": "http://www.loadout.com/", "rating": 2.46, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 74, "owned": 3061, "beaten": 44, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 309}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 80, "ratings_count": 423, "suggestions_count": 672, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 423, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Edge of Reality"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Edge of Reality"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
