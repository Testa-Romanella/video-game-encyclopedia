Unfortunetly I didnt see that there was a restriction until the last day. The restriction was \"no balls\" xD\u00a0<br/>This is a short World Championship Simulator of Table Tennis.</p>\n\n<p>The rules in the game are as following (had no time to implement a tutorial):<br/></p>\n<p>- When you hit the ball it always has to land on the other table side.</p>\n<p>- The ball is only allowed to bounce on your table side once.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>You move your bat with the mouse cursor. When you touch the ball you activate a sort of bullet time which stops time completly and you got time to align your shot. You can cancle the time stop with the right mouse button and shoot with the left mouse button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T07:59:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff19fdfdf496fa16718dd8b97383ed3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Potatuetata"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
