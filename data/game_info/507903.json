{"id": 507903, "slug": "the-shores-of-the-styx", "name": "The Shores of the Styx", "name_original": "The Shores of the Styx", "description": "<p>Hi there I\u00a0am student in the first year of Games Development and this is my first ever game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope it all works ok but not sure so please let me know if you got any feedback in which I can improve my game! As I\u00a0only started I\u00a0know I\u00a0am a mile off from making this game perfect looking but I\u00a0only had 1 week to design it and create it myself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0This game is designed for a game jam called GJL game parade 2020.\u00a0I will try and continue to work on it though as I\u00a0would like it to expand make it a big bigger and maybe build onto the story and game graphics and such.</p>\n<p>The theme of the game jam was \"Carpe diem\" or \"Seize the day\" so in that spirit the\u00a0game story is\u00a0about a little boy called Adrian, living in Ancient Greece in time of Gods. This boy must find his mom in order to offer her the two coins to pass the river Styx. Failing to do so would result in her being lost around on the shore of the Styx for eternity.</p>\n<p>This is my first ever project and very happy to see it uploaded it here.\u00a0 All assets have been created by me in Aseprite, music is free from Unity packs that I\u00a0found on the Unity Store and\u00a0I\u00a0only was\u00a0able to animate a still stance but will in the future add more such as jump and crouch maybe if the world will change enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is very simplistic just with 3 little levels only two of which there are risks of dying. A couple of puzzles. Hopefully as I learn more in college and understand programming more I\u00a0will be able to add more to my game.</p>\n<p>Thank you for trying it out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:29:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f3e77327fa06b2d8ddb104382c9f51a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SGP"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
