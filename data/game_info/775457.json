The local skate celebs are hosting a tournament down at the pier and you\u2019ve been training for this very moment all your life! Head on down and skate \u2018till you drop!</p>\n<p>Sk8 to the Beat is a unique Rhythm and Skateboarding game where you must avoid obstacles and time your skate tricks to the beat of an original skate punk soundtrack! Dodge, ollie, pop shove-it, heel-flip, and most importantly, skate your way to victory while listening to three catchy tracks made by skate punks for skate punks!\r\n</p>\n<p>Are you punk enough? Well, I\u2019d sure hope so because if you let your Punkometer get too low everyone at the pier will think you\u2019re nothing but a poser! Keep your meter up by successfully performing tricks and avoiding obstacles. If you hit an obstacle or miss a trick your meter will be lowered until there\u2019s not a single ounce of punk left in your body! You\u2019ll truly know how punk you are when you get to see the look on the judges\u2019 faces as they observe your run through each track.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Sk8 to the Beat offers a fresh take to both the rhythm and skateboarding genres with its creative fusion, sketchy art style, and uncensored soundtrack. Each art asset has been painstakingly hand-drawn by members of the development team - offering a harmonious relationship between art and gameplay. The music has also been written by members of the development team.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T09:59:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee8/ee8c360452502d3396238679fdfbc99f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SteFeJaJa Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
