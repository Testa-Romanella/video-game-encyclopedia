A lot of it is randomly generated and is different each time you play. There are currently two ways to win but depending on the random generation these can be next to impossible or very straightforward. This was all based on an idea I had that I have simplified to fit into PICO-8 but in the end I'm not sure about it so I don't know if I'll be expanding on it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:34:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac13035e9592b3ac7cce89343bf5e439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tamewhale"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
