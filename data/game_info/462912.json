This is what was done when the jam was finished, I just decided to sleep for a few extra hours rather than polish it and submit it in time. I may flesh the game out further, but this was more a proof of concept to myself that I could accomplish anything at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apologies for any misspellings and how janky the actual game is. There isn't much point to it, but it was definitely an adventure to create. I set out to accomplish something with an animated opening, a usable play button, a moveable component, and then dialogue setup. <br/></p>\n<p>Story: <br/></p>\n<p>You are Star Vanguard, an elite group that travels the galaxies providing support regardless of species or planet. This time around you are searching for Vuna 3, to make a supply drop off. Press E to interact with the planet. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:05:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d28/d281d1a81217afb2174192bda6e01e79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["opiemakesthings"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
