If this happens, panic click in and out of the game a few times.</strong><br/></p><p><strong>P.S. If you use the fullscreen button on the bottom right, reset the level afterwards and things will re-adjust so they're not clipped out of the screen.</strong></p><p><strong>---</strong></p><p>GridShift\u2014A challenging and innovative puzzle game! Collect all the apples in as few moves as possible!<br/></p><p>Every move puts you over by <em>two</em> spaces, not one! That means, to get to certain spots, you'll have to move just one space by hitting an obstacle, performing what is called a Grid Shift.</p><p>Lots of characters to unlock! Play well enough, and you can even unlock me! (Which would be pretty great, because I do not appreciate being locked up.)</p><p>Music is original by me; and can be found on youtube!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc2/fc227e2cbab3676302921f3ea43c35c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Hottest Pocket"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
