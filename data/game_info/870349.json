To change textures, the youtuber 3DSage has a guide to export to the required format. Export to TexAtlas.ppm and monsterTex.ppm To change the music, create a midi file, rename it to D_BKROOM.mid and place in the Sounds folder.\r\n </p>\n<p>When you want the changes to apply, recompile \"backrooms.cpp\" using MinGW32 G++. Midi changes do not require a recompile.\r\n </p>\n<p>Make sure you have FluidSynth added to the includes! Use the winXP x86 version. <br/>Also remember to install Freeglut through MSYS2<br/></p>\n<p>Compile command:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n&lt;MinGW32 g++ path here&gt; .\\src\\backrooms.cpp -o .\\bin\\backrooms.exe -m32 -pthread -mwindows -I\"&lt;minGW32 include path here&gt;\" -I\"&lt;Fluidsynth include path here&gt;\" -L\"&lt;minGW32 lib path here&gt;\" -L\"&lt;Fluidsynth lib path here&gt;\" -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -lglu32 -lglut32 -lwinmm -lfluidsynth\r\n<p>.\\ refers to root path of source directory (contains src and readme)<br/>You can also edit the vscode build task<br/></p>\n<p><strong>---</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Backrooms Wikidot at http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/</p>\n<p>Backrooms: Found Footage by Kane Pixels <br/>https://youtu.be/H4dGpz6cnHo<br/></p>\n<p>Backrooms: First Contact Demo (original scratch version) by BixBox (ported with permission)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 BixBox credits Griffpatch for the scratch raycasting tutorial<br/></p>\n<p>https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/695051017</p>\n<p>OpenGL Raycasting tutorial by 3DSage</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/c/3DSage<br/></p>\n<p>Backrooms: First Contact Demo (PC Port) by TheBlueRuby</p>\n\n<p>Mite Productions is</p>\n<p>Co-Founders - BixBox and TheBlueRuby</p>\n<p>Writers and Artists - TheBlueRuby, Zaethar, BixBox</p>\n<p>Programmers - TheBlueRuby, NoobMuffinMan</p>\n<p>Other members - Intentional Game Design, PandarificJTL</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T09:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f7/3f70977f9676e9ad168514297235640f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheBlueRuby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
