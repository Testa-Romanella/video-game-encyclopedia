Did someone say other players? We've got WHOLE TOURNAMENTS full of people for you to dominate over. Stacks upon stacks of people. Like a tower of meat and bones.<br/><br/>We've spent the last few years spinning the TD genre into something so wild and dangerous, we\u2019re not even sure if the world is ready for it. But hey, it\u2019s your game now, you tell us \u2014 we\u2019re in it for the long haul.<br/><br/>A word of warning, though:<br/>This game is hardcore. If you\u2019re into tickling digital kittens, stick to playing The Tribez (Get good vibes \u2014 play The Tribez!\u00a9).<br/>This game will make you miss your stop during your daily commute!<br/>This game will make you cry tears of joy in unexpected places.<br/><br/>The Survival Arena focuses on these key factors: it\u2019s not about hiring the best troops or winning PvP battles, it\u2019s about prevailing against all odds! Build mighty towers, upgrade them, and try to hold off hordes of incoming enemies!<br/>You know that feeling when it seems like Friday, but it's actually Thursday? Survival Arena is kind of like that. It\u2019s so addicting that when you finally put down the game, you'll realize you\u2019re 93 years old with 20 grandchildren. And it'll have all been worth it.<br/><br/>\u25aa Non-stop explosive TD action!<br/>\u25aa One handed, on-the-go gameplay.

The Arena is legendary and surrounded with myths and superstitions. They say it's run by a Captain long lost to madness. A man who has pirated and plundered more than all other captains combined. To have some fun with all the treasures in his late years, he decided to throw the biggest challenge across the floating isles \u2014 The Survival Arena Tournament.<br/><br/>Any Captain brave enough can venture into the eye of the storm, and if fortune turns its favorable side, they will find the arena. Thousands have tried to beat the challenges and survive, but none could beat the records. It\u2019s time for a new challenger to accept the challenge of the Arena and to become the Grand Champion.<br/><br/>Survive if you dare.<br/><br/>VIP auto-renewable subscription info:<br/>Survival Arena now comes with the option to buy a VIP Subscription.
