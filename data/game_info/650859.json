Use the radar to find parts, the car to move, and shooting to destroy enemies. The game is difficult, not passable with stunning post-apocalyptic graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStory:<br/>\r\nThe world of the future is not such a great place. Great progress requires sacrifices,<br/>\r\nthey turned out to be human past and present. The air became saturated with the poison of factories,<br/>\r\nrivers with the corpses of marine life, bare forests without a single tree ... <br/>\r\nNo one wanted to stay in this damned place, people reached beyond the <br/>\r\nEarth and nevertheless successfully founded a new home.<br/>\r\nWhat happened to the planet? Who cares, except for that miserable handful that still <br/>\r\ncontinued to survive among the mountains of garbage, war machines and mutants? True, only to us.<br/>\r\nIt was possible to exist here, although it was difficult. When the volcanoes began <br/>\r\nthrowing out ash and rivers of lava - all the outcasts of the human race were smart <br/>\r\nenough to understand, this is the end.<br/>\r\n The war for resources intensified a hundredfold, everyone wanted <br/>\r\nto assemble a ship and leave the planet, <br/>\r\nonly the problem was that not everyone even in theory<br/>\r\nknew the principle of operation of this machine.<br/>\r\nFrom now on, this place is hellish hell.
