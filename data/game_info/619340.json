One player uses the A &amp; D keys\u00a0 to move the purple ant and the other uses the Left and Right Arrow keys to move the orange ant. Together, they have to deliver french fries to ant colonies and return with money to get fries for the remaining colonies. They must avoid bumping into snakes or being stepped on.\u00a0 (There are 3 levels and in each level they must deliver 3 fries. )</p>\n<p>Only one player can move at a time. The moving player rotates around the other player as a pivot. Either player can press space to switch which player can move and which player is the pivot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The in game controls/tutorials\u00a0were rushed, so for more clarification, while the A key and Left Arrow key move counter-clockwise and the D and Right Arrow key\u00a0 move clockwise, the controls could also be described as:</p>\n<p>D - moves the purple ant forward</p>\n<p>A - moves the purple ant backwards</p>\n<p>RIGHT - moves red ant forward</p>\n<p>LEFT - moves red ant backwards</p><p>SPACE - switches which ant can move</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c4/7c4b3c8114fc346b452d5ff347a82e94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MuchosWaffles"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
