I'll keep both online to show how the project has progressed -- and the gifs on the old page are still relevant when learning to use the tool.</p><p>In all my tests I've found that this is not an easy tool to learn. But once learned it's quick to get from idea to playing the level.</p>features<p>Two types of road pieces. One is based on a bezier curve, the other is good for making circular roads (loops, spirals, or just an ordinary 90 degree turn). Switch between types with <strong>left/right arrows</strong>.</p><p>The shape of a road piece can be changed in the road ends. The width and banking curvature can be changed. By changing the <em>type</em> of the end the banking changes anchor point.</p><p>A road end can be joined with a road piece to form a junction. It reveals a few handles that makes it possible to shape the junction in pretty much any way.</p><p>The true power of the props have not been revealed yet! So far we've got some <em>fence</em>-like objects (red+white). These can be parented to roads (<strong>J</strong> for join) and positioned at the sides of the roads. Not too exciting yet. The power of the props lie in their ability to follow the road in the <em>road space</em>... more on that later.</p><p>Oh.. and then you can hit <strong>space </strong>to test the track!</p>a few tips<ul><li>Target something and hit <strong>F</strong> to focus the camera on that. Hold right mouse button to orbit</li><li>When you have a road and want to extend it with another road piece then target the end and make a road</li><li>Hold <strong>shift</strong> when you want to move/rotate in increments. Good for making precise adjustments</li><li>Experiment! You can always <strong>ctrl+Z</strong></li></ul>todos<ul><li>More props such as speed boost, checkpoints and a goal line</li><li>Time tracking and saving of best times</li><li>...and much more</li></ul>path to save filesWIN:  C:/Users/[user]/AppData/LocalLow/DefaultCompanyMAC:  Library/Application Support/DefaultCompany/Roads<p>The app defaults to some generic save names (1, 2, 3, etc.), but you can change the file names manually.
