So it's more about cheating on yourself rather than on others. Another source for inspiration was lazy bastards in the workplace.</p>\n<p>The idea was to have five different locations:</p>\n<ul><li>School</li><li>Appartment building</li><li>Workplace</li><li>Retirement home</li><li>Graveyard</li></ul>\n<p>By cheating you gather CheatPoints these points can than be used to cheat in the game. You for example don't have the key to a door, so you can just cheat the door open. The plot twist at the end was that if you gather enough cheat points you even cheat death itself and go live on some Tropical Island.</p>\n<p>So far I have made the level with the appartment building, but it's just not that fun to play and the game is deviating to let's include a bunch of stereotypes to make it fun. Whenever you cheat on your girlfriend you do a little platforming action. The further you get the less your suspicion level goes up, but the more often you cheat with the same person the harder the platforming gets. The obstacles in the platform level are words like \"mom, dad, bf, bff, xtc, std, thc\".</p>\n<p><em>Total development time: 37 hours</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T04:10:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ef/0efe6ca75db4feb8326a7d4efc12d014.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mika la Grand"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
