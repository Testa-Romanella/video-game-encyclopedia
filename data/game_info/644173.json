{"id": 644173, "slug": "via-appia-maybe", "name": "Via Appia, Maybe", "name_original": "Via Appia, Maybe", "description": "<p>Hi! Welcome to\u00a0<strong>\"Via Appia, Maybe.\"\u00a0</strong>It is a simple catch-the-note style rhythm game based halfway on the desire to parody the \"all roads lead to Rome\" proverb and a wish to pursue a space synthwave theme. It was made for Rhythm Jam 2021, which took place in the last week of July.</p>\n<p>In the game, we addressed the Jam's theme through these ideas:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Every\u00a0</strong>lane must be used.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Every\u00a0</strong>road leads to Rome.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Every\u00a0</strong>note makes the colosseum brighter.</p>\n<p>The game is currently very rough around the edges and the controls are slightly janky at times, but if you like the gameplay, music or even our poor attempts at humor, please let us know through comments!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>- Navigating menus: Mouse.</p>\n<p>- Starting a song:\u00a0Press any key.</p>\n<p>- Gameplay: Move with arrow keys. To hit notes, please press the indicated arrow keys and the spacebar at the same time. (ie. Left = Left Arrow + Space &amp; Center = Down Arrow + Space)</p>\n<p>***Current Issues with controls: Will have a hard time registering note hits if players hold keys longer than slight taps. Everything works best when tapping on the keys as if playing a mobile rhythm game; with very brief touches.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A game by: William (LancerAlter) &amp; Aaron (Aaronthefknpanda) (https://itch.io/profile/aaronthefknpanda)</strong></p>\n<p>Music by: Aaronthefknpanda.<br/></p>\n<p>Coding by: LancerAlter &amp; Aaronthefknpanda.</p>\n<p>Art Assets by: LancerAlter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Photographs by Unsplash Users:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://unsplash.com/photos/OVO8nK-7Rfs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditShareLink\r\n</li><li>https://unsplash.com/photos/OVO8nK-7Rfs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditShareLink\r\n</li><li>https://unsplash.com/photos/UfCYo7zHyY8?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditShareLink\r\n</li><li>https://unsplash.com/photos/RpDA3uYkJWM?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditShareLink\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T06:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1b/f1bb91b44bd37d049810144a07f8b117.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LancerAlter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
