Fearing for his sovereignty, contacts a secret corporation for the development of chemical weapons of mass destruction, with name - Zero Experimental Establishment or ZEE. The project is allocated funds and a place of development - a remote corner of the country - the Montib island, cut off from the world, with a small population and no modern infrastructure.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe deafening success of experiments is comparable only with the fundamental failure of the all development. The next monthly report says about the fall of a helicopter with samples of chemical weapons on the island. And a week later, after reports of the observation - of infection of local residents, communication with the employees of the corporation, and indeed with anyone in general, disappears. The government makes a decision in secret from the world community and, despite the protests of the residents of the country who have relatives there, cut off the entire Montib island from the external world, and under pressure forces ZEE to investigate what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDespite the military patrolling the sea around the island and the likelihood of dying from the virus, the flow of people trying to get there is not running out. Someone wants to find relatives and friends, help residents, and someone wants to take possession of the abandoned property of a corporation or just have fun in a place where the laws no longer work.<br/>\r\nWhy are you there - you decide.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe release version of the game will include:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- We have a huge map 20 by 20 kilometers, to reach the other end you need at least an hour and a half, with villages, cities and military bases<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- The map contains areas of summer, autumn and winter, with different air temperatures<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Spawn is located along the entire southern coast<br/>\r\n(no respawns in the center of the map near military bases with top loot!)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Two factions. Marauders and Hunters<br/>\r\n(players will be divided into two factions, depending on their actions. Marauders will be those who kill players, Hunters - who kill bots and marauders. Each faction will have its own camp with a store)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Extraction of resources, from the simplest tree to valuable gold<br/>\r\n(gold will be a currency that can be exchanged for some things)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Transport with physics close to real, with repairs and refueling<br/>\r\n(one or two helicopters per server, which will not be easy to assemble)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Crafting and cooking<br/>\r\n(such dishes as ukha or mushroom soup will give an hourly buff of one or another characteristic, so cooking makes sense)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Building bases<br/>\r\n(wood - stone - metal)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Missions<br/>\r\n(missions will appear on the map, simulating various situations)", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T18:36:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f3/6f3406c051e42f48b98ddab0921ce026.jpg", "website": "https://vk.com/zee_end", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 446, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["T.LEE"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["T.LEE"], "esrb_rating": null}
