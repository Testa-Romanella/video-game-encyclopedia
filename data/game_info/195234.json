You can play with up to four players. One of them is the seeker while the three others play the role of the hiders.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal for the seeker is it to capture (touch) the hiding players while the hiding players (obviously) try to prevent that.</p>\n<p>To make this a little more interesting we added <strong>anaglyphic glasses</strong>. This means that even though the 4 players stare at the same screen, they all see different things.<br/>The hiders only see their players while the seeker only sees his player.</p>\n<p>To give yourself an advantage you can drop traps for your fellow hiders or highlight them as the seeker.\u00b4</p>\n<p>Ampe was made in 2 days\u00a0during the Global Game Jam 2018.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong><br/>1. Get yourself some anaglyphic glasses(oldschool 3D glasses)<br/>2. Modify them in a way that you end up with three pairs of red glasses and one blue pair.<br/>3. Plug your controllers in.<br/>4. Put on the glasses. (The seeker gets the blue ones and the hiders get the other ones)<br/>5. Have fun!</p>\n<p><em>Developed by</em><em><br/>- Simon Haag (Twitter)<br/>- Patrick Tobler (Twitter)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61c570185cbc463b0c7a9e3d30fd04a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Padierfind", "HerrHawk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
