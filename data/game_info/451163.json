We're excited the show the world our first ever contribution to the Indie Game Dev community. I myself had prior experience with unity, although limited, while Carson and Seth opened unity for the first time this weekend. We learned a lot and I cannot believe how well it turned out. We hope to bring out further updates to the game with a lot of quality of life changes. Thank you for reading and giving our game a play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T05:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd61ee775ccc68f76dd5269f749916d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["S1lver"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
