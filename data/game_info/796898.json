I have been learning Unity on my off-time for four years now and am finally publishing my first game. Last year I made several mods for the game Endless Legend, and even made a Youtube channel teaching people how to mod the game. I will try to update the game as frequently as I can, but that all depends on the amount of work I have. Even though my schedule was hectic last year I was still able to pump out three updates on Steam, and now I am releasing my game on Itch<br/></p>\r\nFuture Plans\r\n<p>Now that the game has a decent foundation there are many components and mechanics that I can improve on. Below are a list of some of the mechanics that I plan to improve. If any of these interest you please leave a comment.</p>\n<ol><li>More biomes<br/>\n</li><li>Adding more features to the desert biome (Any particular feature please leave a comment. One idea was to add a desert plant, such as an olive tree, that can be cultivated and used to improve the upgrade system)<br/>\n</li><li>Adding more upgrades<br/>\n</li><li>Improving enemy AI (improving he evolution AI as well)<br/>\n</li><li>Adding more enemy types (such as bosses)<br/>\n</li><li>Improving the art<br/>\n</li><li>Improving the sound (music and sound effects)<br/>\n</li><li>Adding a multiplayer feature (doing this may force the game to be monetized though)<br/>\n</li><li>More community events and improving community engagement (such as live streams and AMAs)<br/>\n</li><li>Improving the marketing of the game (similar to community but making an Instagram page and posting on Reddit)<br/>\n</li><li>Adding a story<br/>\n</li><li>Adding a feature that makes the game linear in certain areas (like caves that turn the game into a platformer, where the players collect resources and improve score after beating that section. The base game will remain the same and serve as a hub world for the game. This can be used to add a story by making the game more linear)<br/>\n</li><li>Add objectives to the game<br/>\n</li><li>Add the game to other languages (This will probably be done in google translate unless anyone wants to help out with this who are fluent in another language)<br/>\n</li></ol>\n<p>If any of these features interest you please comment on which one you think I should work on. If none of them do, then please comment on what feature(s) I should add.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyways thank you guys for your continuing support of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T16:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/670/670f8921d0b02de13f6a2006dcbc931b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["justinav"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
