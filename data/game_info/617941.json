Bear, a robot who wears a cartoon bear mask. Revolting against the tyrannical robot government, he now fights upon flying ships to earn his humanity. His fellow robots are not pleased with his actions and G. Bear must now survive an onslaught of attacks to attempt to bring back justice and peace to the world.<br/></p>\n<p>This theme inspired the grappling mechanic of the player who, instead of dodging enemies must grapple themself towards them to escape danger. This is just about the opposite of what a normal bullet hell is structured like, and we thought it was a fairly interesting and fun spin on it.</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Zachary Maizes - Project Manager, Lead Programmer\r\n</li><li>Angelinne Mendenhall - Lead Artist\r\n</li><li>Michael Sedlack - Lead Sound Designer,\u00a0Programmer</li><li>Sam\u00a0Isenberg - Programmer</li><li>Jefferson LeVasseur - Artist, Sound Designer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:38:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cf78ac5ad399f00cbb24b9ee79455c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zachary", "jerrythemeatball", "lordwumpus", "eelnoises", "Name OTC"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
