You must constantly be hunting, constantly butchering, preparing for the cold, trading, and staying hydrated. If you slack off, you die. Get too drunk and you will die. Pee too little and you will die. Sleep too much and you will die.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Get married, have a kid, and play the harmonica by the campfire. Choose from a collection of classic tunes performed by various artists. Craft clothes to stay warm, and see how long you can last.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6ba51d5db1297e9f2e5259cb07c94a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SwegDawgs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
