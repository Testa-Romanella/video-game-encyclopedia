People are driving hover cars, talking through smartphones and...</p>\n<p>Suddenly there's huge shrimps everywhere?</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, the effects of the alien crash were mostly shrimp related. Now massively increased in size, the shrimps began their transition from water-borne crustaceans to the terrors of dry land, eating a majority of the Earth's plant-life, killing people and spreading like a wildfire. People went mad. The government began making quarantine zones. Hope was lost...</p>\n<p>Until... The Shrimp Wranglers arrived. They wrangled most of the shrimps back into their natural habitats, slowing down their climb towards global domination and saving humanity along with most of planet Earth's greenery.</p>\n<p>Hope was back.</p>\n<p>Now it's the 1980s, the wranglers, now retired from their positions as shrimp combatants have taken to the saddle and travel to cities in trouble to save them.</p>\n<p>THIS IS...</p>\n<p>SHRIMP. WRANGLER.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0Controls:<br/>- A and D will maneuver you left and right respectively, helping you dodge obstacles.<br/>- The spacebar allows you to jump into the air, providing another way to avoid slamming into something.<br/>- Left-clicking allows you to channel the bond you have with your shrimp into a powerful beam of energy, destroying some obstacles that lie ahead. Be careful, as not only does this ability have to charge up to be used, it can only destroy organic objects. Avoid helicopters, uncontrollable cars and walls at any cost.<br/>- Escape will display the escape menu, either letting you continue your shrimp adventure or leaving. Your high-score will be saved.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0Credits:</p>\n<p>Music Sources:\u00a0<br/>- Carpenter Brut for shrimp riding tunes.\u00a0https://carpenterbrut.bandcamp.com/<br/>- Taitoki for the main menu theme, which is: https://taitoki.bandcamp.com/t...</p>\n<p>Sound Sources:<br/>\u00a0[PLEASE CHECK DESCRIPTION ON GAMEJOLT, COULDN'T BE PROVIDED DUE TO THE WAY ITCH.IO HANDLES MEDIA LINKS]\u00a0https://gamejolt.com/games/shr...</p>\n<p>Shrimp Model:\u00a0<br/>\u00a0http://www.cadnav.com/plus/dow...</p>\n<p>Game Inspired by a man shouting: \"IS THAT A MAN RIDING A SHREEEMP?!?\"\u00a0[PLEASE CHECK DESCRIPTION ON GAMEJOLT, COULDN'T BE PROVIDED DUE TO THE WAY ITCH.IO HANDLES MEDIA LINKS]\u00a0https://gamejolt.com/games/shr...<br/></p>\n<p>Clipart Shrimp:\u00a0<br/>http://clipartall.com/clipart/...<br/>Font: http://www.1001fonts.com/route...</p>\n<p>Art done by Protohm Dwellerguy, AKA Logan</p>\n<p>Programming done by Protohm Johnny, AKA Johnny</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bd7b76bc3dca6b0868f35976f1483e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Protohm Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
