Can you imagine playing poker and defending your territory at the same time as in the classic Tower Defense? However, think about the fact that winning a game of poker you can earn money on vital resources with which you can strengthen your defense and everything will fall into place at once!Features:<ul><li>Unique mechanics<br/></li><li>Tower Defense<br/></li><li>Card game<br/></li><li>Suitable for Windows, Mac and Linux</li></ul><br/>If you look closely, the unusual in this game is not only the presence of poker games as a means to earn game money for protection. Themselves the defenders consist of the classic dice - the Dyson. Gradually, they can be improved by connecting in pairs with the same cubes, thereby saving space on the playing field and strengthening the defense. Over time, a place on the table will be vital, so do not neglect this opportunity! Cubes have different effects-some just cause damage, others freeze or hit multiple targets. Of course, this greatly affects their price and your task will be to find a compromise between these parameters and build an ideal defense, which nothing will be able to break through.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b30b9610195f1bcc91091725b9fab549.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Educational Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Educational Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
