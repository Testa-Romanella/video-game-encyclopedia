It was carried out for a study project at Isart Digital whose constraint was to produce a One-Button game.</p>\r\nIn Alter Ego, you play as Emily, a teenager with a dissociative identity disorder. Her body is thus divided between her and her alter-ego, Eylime, who is violent and subject to psychopath issues. Every night, Eylime tries to take control of their body by corrupting Emily's memories to silence her forever. You must therefore resist by remembering the moments of your life to free yourself from Eylime's grip.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T09:23:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd2f949b0056ca6bceb8e421e7ca2bf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wyyrlok"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
