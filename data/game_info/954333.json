The graphics are <strong>very</strong> rough and the game is short (but hopefully fun). If people like the concept I might polish it and release it on Itch.io as a more presentable game so let me know if you would appreciate that :). The game itself took 3 hours and a few additional hours were spent planning and building etc (as per the rules of Trijam).</p>\n\n<p>Coding / Story: Desmodium Games</p>\n<p>Voice acting: Oliver Wilson-Dickson</p>\n<p>Crisp-eating sound effect by Taira Komori:\u00a0Freesound - \"eating_crisps1.mp3\" by Taira Komori</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T07:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c346d4c71a4b20b94f01d984596c915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Desmodium Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
