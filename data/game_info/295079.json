{"id": 295079, "slug": "land-war", "name": "Land War", "name_original": "Land War", "description": "Land War is a party game you can actually play at a party!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTeach your friends, mom, grandpa, or anyone else to play in minutes and invite everyone in on the big screen with 8 player local multiplayer!  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSimple controls - choose between moving up, down, left, or right and that's all there is to it!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvery land war player starts as a humble square in a sea of unclaimed land.  But as you move, you capture the squares around you, growing at an exponential rate!  Watch out as you encounter your friend's square armies - only the clever players will survive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach match lasts around 10 minutes, so it's easy to swap players in and out as the night goes on!  Have fun with over 20 maps and several experimental settings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFull disclosure- this is my first game and it comes from sheer love of local multiplayer and disappointment that so few video games can be played with more than 4 players on the same screen.  I'm looking to get feedback here on Steam before a console release, so please send any issues and suggestions to the game\u2019s contact email or community hub.
