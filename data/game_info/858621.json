Today is the seventh day of his death. In China, this means that today is the day his soul came home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Little Tom didn't know that he was dead. The others in his eyes are paper men (pale skin, which is the color of paper, and strange blush).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom's parents and friends don't want to reveal this cruel truth, but just want to chat with him as usual, play games with him, or fulfill a small wish so that he can be reincarnated in peace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The story is very short, I didn't give the player a lot of choices, I just wanted to finish the story.\u00a0I also designed two mini-games to increase the fun. When Tom and Dad were discussing how to clean the corridor, I decided to add a maze puzzle.

He habitually refuses others' kindness; he wants to play with others but was shy to say\u2026</p>\n<p>That fire burned everything down...Until the seventh day after Tom died...</p>\n<p>In the corridor, in Tom's imagination, Ms. Kate was still very kind and offered him hot soup. Dad is busy with work, even if he looks tired, he will go home to stay with Tom. Mom no longer wears heavy makeup, but an apron. After playing mahjong, she will buy food for Tom with the money earned from playing mahjong. The Twins will invite him to play together...</p>\n<p>In the corridor, the 5 NPCs in Tom's eyes looked like paper men, but after leaving the building, the NPCs all returned to normal human appearances, but Tom turned into a paper man...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T12:51:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7eb/7eb6e1d2bc0ae3d186aebd31a3e614ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JaydeZ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
