She uses the timeloops as established in Corpse Party: Book of Shadows to force all survivors at that point to participate in activities she has set up. Given it&#39;s either that or die horribly again, something all are aware that they&#39;ve already experienced but can&#39;t remember in full, they go along with her demands. The game features almost all characters from the previous games and some new ones. While a pseudo-horror spin-off at best, it is part of the storyline, setting up a few details to prepare for Corpse Party: Blood Drive.</p>\n<p>As with Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, there is only one extra chapter. This extra chapter takes place during the previous game and is more conventional horror. It tells of Yoshiki&#39;s and Ayumi&#39;s encounter with four students from Sugatani Senior High School, notably Azusa Takai.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/779/7794cfc649d31496316471f53964f7f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["5pb."], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["5pb.", "Team GrisGris"], "esrb_rating": null}
