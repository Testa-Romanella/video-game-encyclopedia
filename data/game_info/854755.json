So game is never crashed in my play tests, but sometimes everything calculating needs a while. Be patient and no worry!<br/></p>\n<p>--------<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a prototype, developed for the cozy autumn gamejam in 2 weeks. Sorry, no time was for a better storytelling. I had much to do with making a procedual maze in the terrain, make the bunnys running home with you proper on a dynamic navmesh and make the gamemechanik and the level structure progressive and amazing. I am happy with my result, and beeing part of this gamejam community was all. Let's see who like to play this bunny game.<br/></p>\n<p>Please dont hesitate to give feedback how the game is running on your environment and how you like it and what you miss for a full game.<br/></p>\n<p>A final version will be made if any people have fun to explore more of the rabbits world. <br/></p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>The bunnys are in memoriam of our beloved Beetle &amp; Juice bunnys we had more then 8 years at home.</p>\n<p>The music and sound FX is from my alter ego Richard Steinschlag (DJ &amp; Producer, electronic Stuff)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73b/73b6aa1a509d2c338536d35b220fd5f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HITBOX GAMES"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
