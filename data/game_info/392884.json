{"id": 392884, "slug": "twenty-shinytseul", "name": "Twenty (ShinyTseul)", "name_original": "Twenty (ShinyTseul)", "description": "<p>This is a simple dice game I designed a few years ago. I haven't thought much of it since then, until the 20th Anniversary GameMaker Game Jam, which has the theme of \"20.\" It was fate. So I turned my dice game into a video game. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Rules:</p>\n<p>Take turns rolling two dice. Each die is scored separately:</p>\n<p>1 - Gain 1 point</p>\n<p>2 - Gain 2 points</p>\n<p>3 - Choose an opponent to lose 1 point</p>\n<p>4 - Lose 1 point</p>\n<p>5 - Skip your next roll</p>\n<p>6 - Extra roll</p>\n<p>Doubles - Bonus + 2 points</p>\n<p>The first player to get at least 20 points wins!</p>\n<p>There are a few other rolls, but I\u00a0didn't have time to put them in, because college and stuff.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please email me at shinytseul@gmail.com and I will respond promptly.</p>\n\n<p>Known deficiencies:</p>\n<p>- Tiebreakers above 10 points weren't included in this release</p>\n<p>- Selecting a player to lose a point is difficult when there are multiple in one space</p>\n<p>- Didn't have time to animate the dice I\u00a0drew, that'll have to be a future update</p>\n<p>- There is no sound, resulting in a somewhat ominous silence</p>\n<p>- Some messages seem to play multiple times. If I\u00a0had more time, I\u00a0could have smoothed it out a bit better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T06:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4f/a4f0f5b2a259b828f3b4f478230ddb16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShinyTseul"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
