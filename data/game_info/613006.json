The theme was \"growth\"</p>\n<p>Linux build was not playtested.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately there seems to be a bug in the math segment of the game where the game just freezes. It happened twice in a row and never again and we have no idea what causes it. With only 1 hour left before the jam ends, we don't want to poke any potential holes into an otherwise working game by attempting to fix it.<br/></p>\n<p>We are really sorry if you happen to encounter this bug. For instances like this, we have uploaded our test version, which lets you choose a closer spot to where you left off on than restarting it completely. On top of that, it has a freeplay segment where you can play with the caterpillar or just watch it walk around.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Amanda \"Colorparty\" Clubb - Programming, Design, Dialogue<br/>Martin \"Chaonic\" Voth - Art, Design, Backstory</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T10:23:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f5637176bb38ad7b6b62578e8b5e9a49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Chaonic"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
