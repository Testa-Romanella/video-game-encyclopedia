(2014-2015)</p>\n<p>The Isotope Project is a really ambitious story that I've been thinking about since high school and used to test out Ren'Py functions. Unfortunately, I\u00a0never completed it.\u00a0</p><p>You play as 17-year-old Iris who recently survived a terrible car accident and has been making some questionable decisions since then. Through fated circumstance, she is mysteriously sent to another world controlled by another girl her age, and Iris struggles to find a way home while befriending (?) the strange animal-people condemned to this world.</p>\n<p>Was thinking about digital archives and decided to upload it for prosperity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of the art is mine aside from some blurred backgrounds from Google. I\u00a0actually redrew over some real photographs for backgrounds. Wild.</p>\n<p>The music is a mix of things from Hagall and HMIX, but I've sadly lost the original names for the songs.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/>- The game ends very abruptly after the Masked One encounter. I normally make games as I write them, so I\u00a0ended on a cliffhanger for the project :(<br/>- The game was never optimized to be bigger than the default 800x600!\u00a0Try to play with just that size.\u00a0<br/>- A lot of the sfx don't match up timing-wise with what's going on.\u00a0<br/>- Mac and Windows/Linux builds are available, but I couldn't test them on Mac and Linux. :( Hopefully no huge issues there.<br/>- Have fun! Don't give up on your own game ambitions! Don't be lazy with backgrounds! (I totally am)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T06:46:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b1c223f52ded846b170a68e40f557a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sam Luangkhot"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
