This was also my first experience creating a game with Godot, I just started learning it 3 months ago.\u00a0I do have game development experience creating Flash games but last one I created was more than 6 years ago. I've been mainly focused on other types of software development (mobile apps and web). Since I graduated as a software engineer last year I have more time now and\u00a0very recently I decided to come back to the Game Development world as a hobbie, and here I am :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the week this game jam lasted I worked full-time on my day job and I worked\u00a0hard on this game at night so it was a VERY exhausting week for me. I didn't do anything else other than work the hole week\u00a0really\u00a0to get done as much as I\u00a0could for this game. But\u00a0I think it was worth it.\u00a0All in all I'm very proud of the results\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>During the development process I kept a Dev Log on a Google Docs that you can access here (but please play the game first since it contains spoilers!):\u00a0Google Docs</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to my girlfriend Vero that supported me the hole week, and to my brother Guille that created the music and sound effects for the game.</p>\n<p>If you loved the music and sounds consider hiring him for your next project ;) Guillermo Dorfman - guillermodorfman@gmail.com</p>\n<br/>I hope you enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed creating it.
