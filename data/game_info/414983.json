Greg is a bug catcher. Greg likes to catch bugs.<br/></p>\n<p>One day, Greg was out catching butterflies until he stumbles upon a suspicious well which then asks Greg for his butterfly. When Greg gives the well the butterfly, the well swallows it up, but then asks for more sacrifices. Greg now knows what he must do; with his net in hand, he enters into the deep depths of the dungeon.</p>\n<p><em>Nets have holes, wells have holes... bit of a stretch but close enough.</em></p>\n\n<p>Tips for the boss:</p>\n<ul><li>Focus on hitting the dragon with your net during the first phase whenever its not charging up its attack (you can tell when its charging its attack if you pay close enough attention)</li><li>You can catch its fireballs with your net and hit it back towards the dragon to deal 3 points of damage!</li><li>During the second phase, the dragon won't try to directly attack you, so focus on catching/dodging its fireballs and release them back at the dragon (no need for aiming because they are homing fireballs)</li><li>Hitting the final blow with your net and catching the dragon in its second phase will refill your health, so don't worry about taking damage when going for the final blow! (unless you only have 1 heart left)</li><li>In some situations, if a fireball is coming right at you and you have a fireball in your net, you can throw your fireball at it and they will hit each other</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:46:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/66088f0ae458cc3f87c7f84b6d0334ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Cabidge"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
