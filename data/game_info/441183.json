We still hope you enjoy our little game :)<br/></p>\n<p>We also respected the both following challenges:</p>\n<ul><li>Stick to a grid (8x8,\u00a06x8, 5x5, ect.)</li><li>No overlaying graphics (at no point 2 graphics will overlap each-other so you can see one under the other)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:00:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34d/34d2b03c152d9c3ba0e542cd6960fceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hakiomon", "iriohmon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
