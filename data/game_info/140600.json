In the beginning you have 10 blobs of each color. Use your mouse wheel to cycle through your colors.</p>\n<p>Aim at uncolored blocks and press LMB to color them. Press RMB on colored blocks to make them transparent so you can see (kinda) what\u2019s behind them.</p>\n<p>Whenever you color a block, you lose one blob of color. You gain new blobs by connecting blocks of the same color.</p>\n<p>If you connect at least 3 blocks (ie. their faces touch) they will vanish and you get one blob of color per block destroyed. Your score will also increase depending on how many blocks you destroyed (the more you destroy at once, the better).</p>\n<p>You lose the game if you have no more color blobs left, or if you fall out of the big cube of cubes you\u2019re in.</p>\n<p>There is no win condition. The point of the game is just to relax and raise your personal highscore. :)</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba75890086aa487dc0b93373a32cbec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Vinterskog"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
