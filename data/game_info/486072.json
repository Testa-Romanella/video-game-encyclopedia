{"id": 486072, "slug": "centripetal", "name": "Centripetal", "name_original": "Centripetal", "description": "<p>Centripetal is a puzzle game where solar systems need to be reformed to create a balanced and stable system. Players move planets to get them to\u00a0their proper\u00a0distance\u00a0from the sun and travelling at the approximate correct velocity to stay in orbit (according to rough Newtonian physics). However, planets are fragile and there are many celestial obstacles that get in your way. Try to piece together all 10 solar systems without destroying your planets and\u00a0before time runs out!</p>\n<p>Feedback and bug reports are greatly appreciated! Just post them in the comments and I may make an update or 2, especially if it prevented you from getting the full experience out of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T05:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12f/12fc05bf7a556cdda467ccb804bb19dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jeffrey Gaydos"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
