This is normal, right? Well it turns out that this individual is really nice. You\u2019ll find that as you continue playing, there are different endings and scenarios, as well as multiple choice confession scenes! Choose the right answers or you\u2019ll be friendzoned... or even worse, rejected!</p>\n<p>FAQ:</p>\n<p>Q \u201cThe characters don\u2019t move, why?\u201d - A: \u201cIt was a college project, so I had a little less time than usual to make this game. It would take a while to draw out different poses and would be overkill at the moment. Maybe in a future update we\u2019ll have dynamic posing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Q \u201cWhy did you not get help from others or use Royalty-free resources?\u201d - A: \u201cI wanted to keep everything as primary as possible, meaning every asset in this game was made entirely by myself. If possible, in the future or for a future game in this series I might incorporate voice acting and other such resources from people that aren\u2019t just me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Q \u201cAny Easter eggs?\u201d - A: \u201cYes. Three Easter eggs where two of them get you an ending. The other lets you play the game normally but with subtle dialogue changes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Q \u201cHow many endings are there?\u201d - A: \u201cAround six or so. Try and find them all.\u201d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T03:32:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da5e2564997ee071810c47b03e3ba2ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lewnatic32"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
