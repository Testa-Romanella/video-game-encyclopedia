Music was generously contributed by Thomas Collins (thomascollinsmusic@gmail.com), who also produced the original sound effects that I mangled to produce the sounds you hear in the game.</p><p>Speaking of sound, audio doesn't work for me in Firefox :(  Chrome works.</p><p>Source code is on Github.</p>Changes since the Ludum Dare deadline:<br/><ul><li>Added Thomas's email address to the title screen.</li><li>Added a short delay on player death before the mouse button will take you to the title screen, as a friend was finding it annoying that he sometimes accidentally clicked past his score on death.  I think that's an OK change as a small 'quality of life' thing, right?  If you disagree, feel free to mark me down on it :)</li><li>Similarly, made spacebar immediately start a new game after you die instead of going via the title screen.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcd/bcd75b1cf418e048b606951842a82de1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["karln"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
