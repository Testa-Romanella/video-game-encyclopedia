I had a lot of fun doing it, I had many challenges like game mechanics, rebindable keys with the new <em>Input System </em>and intermidiate programming such as <em>State Machine Pattern </em>or <em>Service Locator Pattern. </em>I am very proud of it, since it is technically my most advanced and most polished project.</p>\n<p>Making the rebindable keys was an achievement since there is so little information and resources about it, I overcame the challenge by gathering all the little information that was out there, some examples that came with the package and a ton of console logs! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb<br/></p>\r\nKeyboard Controls\r\n<p>\u25aa Menu Navigation: Arrow keys or WASD<br/>\u25aa Menu Selection: Return key<br/>\u25aa Pause / Back: Escape key<br/>\u25aa Ship Movement: Arrow keys (Default)<br/>\u25aa Ship Shooting: Space key (Default)<br/></p>\r\nGamePad Controls\r\n<p>\u25aa Menu Navigation: Left Thumb Stick<br/>\u25aa Menu Selection: Button A / South<br/>\u25aa Pause / Back: Button B / East<br/>\u25aa Ship Movement: DPad (Default)<br/>\u25aa Ship Shooting: Button A / South (Default)</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>\u2714 Rebindable Keys<br/>\u2714 Saves Highscore<br/>\u2714 GamePad Support<br/>\u2714 Graphical Settings<br/><br/>Thanks to <em>Oblidivm </em>for the music files, downloaded from opengameart.org<br/>Attribution notice: http://oblidivmmusic.blogspot.com.es</p>\r\nSource Code: https://github.com/Jon50/Invaders", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/bab02fd7d99cfb341f5659706932271e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Jo\u00e3o Cunha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
