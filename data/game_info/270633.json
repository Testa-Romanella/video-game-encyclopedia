Well, at least that's what happens in my case.</p>\n<p>Controls (PC):<br/>A, D for moving left and right.<br/>Spacebar for jumping.<br/><br/>Controls (Android):<br/>Use the arrow buttons to move to the desired direction.<br/>Tap anywhere on the screen without a button to jump.<br/><br/>Tips:<br/>Jumping decreases your rolling speed.<br/>Fire can melt your snowball so beware of it.<br/>Fire can also slow you down but being melted too much will cause your snowball to melt completely.<br/><br/>Credits to Colin Brown for his awesome UI pack, get them here:<br/>https://colinbrown.itch.io/hand-drawn-icons<br/><br/>Thanks for playing this game and please donate if you can.
