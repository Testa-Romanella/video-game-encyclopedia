bows, cannons, anti-aircraft guns, and barracks - to intercept enemies.<br/>You need to build your own internal facilities because the cost is not recovered even if you defeat the enemy.<br/><br/><br/>Building a Ranch will increase your population, and building a MANA Tank will increase your MANA.<br/>Population can only be used to build basic towers, but MANA can be used to build summoning towers.<br/>Population is not only consumed to build towers, but it is also the HP that can withstand enemy attacks.<br/><br/><br/>With the summoning tower, you can use powerful summoners and their unique magic to take advantage of battles.<br/>This casual battle, which takes only 5 minutes per stage, has a total of 65 stages.<br/>The stages after the middle stage will not be easy to win.<br/>The difficulty level will vary greatly depending on the strategy you choose, whether cultivating internal affairs or using the population for defense!<br/><br/>The difficulty level can be selected from \"easy,\" \"normal,\" and \"hard,\" and can be switched at any time.<br/><h3>attributes</h3>The game has four types of attributes: fire, ice, lightning, and wind.<br/>There are four types of attributes in this game: fire, ice, lightning, and wind.<br/><br/>Flame attacks may cause the enemy to burn.<br/>Combustion does additional sustained damage, but at a faster rate.<br/><br/>Ice attacks can freeze the enemy.<br/>Freezing slows down the enemy but removes the burning state.<br/>Flame and ice are incompatible.<br/><br/>Basically, red enemies are resistant to fire and blue enemies are resistant to ice.<br/><br/>Lightning attacks can paralyze the enemy.<br/>Wind attacks slow down and cause sustained damage when in a storm zone.<br/>Wind is ineffective against large, heavy enemies and is effective against smaller or flying enemies.<br/><br/>Other status abnormalities include poison, instant death, and charm.<br/>Each enemy has its own set of attribute resistances, with a maximum of 90% of damage cut.<br/>If you do not attack with an effective attribute, you will not be able to defeat even the small fry.<br/>Enemies' attribute resistance can be checked before the battle begins.<h3>BGM</h3>35 original BGM songs in all!<br/>When all bosses appear, boss-specific BGM will be played to liven up the battle.<h3>Languages Supported</h3>English/Japanese/Chinese (Simplified)/Spanish/German/French/Portuguese (Brazil)/Turkish/Italian/Russian/Indonesian/Korean/Malay/Vietnamese/Hindi/Chinese (Traditional)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T05:30:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdf/fdf229e9745abd62d053db7fa0e35694.jpg", "website": "https://lunamon.luna-no-shippo.co.jp/index_en.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Luna's Tail Creative"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Luna's Tail Creative"], "esrb_rating": null}
