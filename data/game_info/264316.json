There is supposed to be a skybox, and the lighting is less glitchy. Do not attempt to adjust your volume; there is currently no audio in the game. A downloadable Windows executable version is in the downloads below.Controls:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Steer with the mouse.</li>\n<li>W is accelerator pedal, S is brakes. X is reverse.</li>\n<li>A and D are course correction strafing, Q and E are hard strafing.</li>\n<li>F flips your car to its correct orientation if it is upside down.</li>\n<li>Right click to toggle interact mode, or hold right click for freelook.</li>\n<li>Space bar to jump, and hold it in for \"drift mode\".</li>\n<li>Shift key for boost. Use with caution.</li>\n<li>R activates nanobot repair. Currently has no function as there is no consequence for hitting 0% hull integrity.</li>\n</ul>\r\nTips:\r\n<p>Steering, strafing, and applying thrust are impossible while your car is airborne, but boosting still works; this is not a bug, it is intended behaviour. To take turns at speed, strafe into them to shift your momentum. You can quickly bring your car to a hard stop from a high speed by turning your car hard in one direction and hard-strafing against your momentum.</p>\r\nKnown Issues and Bugs:\r\n<p>Slopes are precarious, especially if your speedometer is not in the white. The implementation of post-loss-of-control drag gain is buggy, sometimes resulting in the car \"hanging in the air\", falling incredibly slowly. Once the car is firmly on the ground, the issue disappears. Collisions at extremely high velocities, especially side-swiping ones, can result in the car clipping through the world. While I have a few measures planned to address this, Unity's physics engine is running at its maximum fidelity setting, so I can only do so much more to address the inherent issues of objects moving at such great velocities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen-World Cyberpunk Hoverdriving\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Neo-Montr\u00e9al, 2049.</strong> Declan Coyne is a low-level drug dealer and taxi driver with a penchant for gambling and an addiction to risk.

His only hope is to embark on a wild night of crime, intrigue, lethal danger, and irate passengers.
