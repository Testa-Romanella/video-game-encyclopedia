She then wrote &quot;Battle Splash&quot;, a game inside B.O.S.s that features high speed Water Balloons and Water simulation in order to create the most intense Squirt Gun Battle ever. She then invited her friend (Temiko Kangara), her cousin (Pentaga Polyga) and her sister (Quadra Polyga) to test the game out. After an unexpected journey due to a bug during the test, she then further improved the game, and made the second version of it: &quot;Battle Splash 2.0&quot;.<br />\nThe game is designed to be as Easy to Play as possible, while still keeps the best features of Classic Arena Shooter and Class-based Shooter.
