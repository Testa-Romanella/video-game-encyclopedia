As you collect cubes your speed increases by .25. I found it a bit difficult to deal with the prefabs as some would warp when i scaled them I\u00a0also had some trouble with using scene names for sceneloader. The game has a few scripts one for the marble for each level and one for camera movement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T12:36:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ac/2ac35a367262046a318b3d0f82d09b7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["geg321"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
