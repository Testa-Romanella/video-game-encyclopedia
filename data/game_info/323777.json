JUST PLEASE WATCH THE FULL GAMEPLAY VIDEO.\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gEnwivHvp0<br/></p>\n<p>Patrick is a guy, who is living in a boring gray city.Everything looks same and dull.\u00a0 The new bleeding edge\u00a0\u00a0technology comes in to the city.\u00a0 Introducing, the machine that gives you chance to live in a game that you like.</p>\n<p>\u00a0When you want to use the\u00a0 special attack of Quick Take down, as you swap the camera to FPS to do so, please do not move. You can rotate. There is a bug and i am too lazy to fix it.\u00a0 If you move just click \"U\" twice to reset positions so it does not bug and land on the enemy and kill it.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 While using FIRFIR\u00a0 you do not have to spam left or right click\u00a0 it works fine. If firfir doesnt return it means that it is actually returning but cuz of gravity under water it is very down there and it takes a lot of time to retun. So just killyourself if you dont want to wait.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>At the first level please wait cutscene to end and dont move. I didnt lock the character movement. It doesnt bug but just dont move and watch dont be a jerk. And again in this level i didnt freeze rotation so if you hit any wall and flip, TOO BAD, alt f4 xd.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you stuck anywhere and dont know what to do. JUST PLEASE WATCH THE FULL GAMEPLAY VIDEO.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gEnwivHvp0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T05:54:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e4/4e47742bbf76a003645bbf32b858f551.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cevher"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
