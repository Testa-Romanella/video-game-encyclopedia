The issue doesn't exist when I played it outside my browser, but that is what happens when playing in the browser.  I will see if I can fix it before the jam ends. <br/></p>\n<p>This project is kind of recycled from my previous game made for Touhou Fan Game Jam 4, which I did not do well at all. Seeing how the theme of this week's WGJ is already completely similar to that game, I quickly recycled and turned it into this game. The gameplay and the main character is the same, but the boss is completely changed. Also added more SFX compared to the ash it came from <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:39:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1bda571f835a2dcbcdd0427ff72ebee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ran d'Reille"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
