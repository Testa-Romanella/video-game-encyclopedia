Team up with Dante, from the Devil May Cry series! Do your best to gather clues and enter the mysterious forest!</p>\n<p>This game is based off the Half Life: Alyx custom workshop map by the same name. I made this project to learn how to use Renpy, as this is my first time using the engine. Despite this being a silly little practice project, there's a lot of content here, and I hope you enjoy playing the game!</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: All of the characters in this game, being fictional or not, aren't accurate to their regular interpretations. They are simply my own interpretations of them.</p>\n<p>Note: All of the video cutscenes that play can't be skipped for the first three seconds. This is to prevent the player from accidentally skipping them, but still let them skip them after a few seconds if they need to. Also some of the stuff in this game is unfinished, but I don't care lol.</p>\n<p>Link to the original Daniel's B-day Surprise:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2534256762</p>\n<p>Link to Daniel Gaming's YouTube channel:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDuZXQ0141NjIoGJMBR9WiA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T15:30:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/354/354ddd8b40ddf50c5a00a887c61a30a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Korny"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
