(l a r i)", "description": "<p>A game about friends that always bail out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>BASED ON TRUE EVENTS (kinda)<br/></p>\n<p>The story follows three friends that are fed up with Manos; the last piece of their friend group that is constantly missing. Will they be able to reach him and let him know how hurtful he's being, when he ignores them, or when he cleverly evades questions and criticism? Probably not, because he's never answering any calls and refuses to open the door.</p>\n<p>The game contains mature language. It also contains copyrighted music and assets from artists that I've credited in the end of the game. Show them some love!</p>\n<p>Time to complete - 15 minutes MAX</p>\n<p>Endings - 2</p>\n<p>This game took me about a week to make. It's by no means perfect, so please let me know of there are any issues that must be fixed. Also, the friend in question played the game beforehand and now we're cool again :)</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing, I'll be making more games in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T06:38:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33d/33d963cbec68f9eddf4573f3c33bf921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["l a r i"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
