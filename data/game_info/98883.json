I'm testing a new system though, instead of just removing the damage from your health, the damage is converted to \"blood\", which drains over time, and can be restored. When the blood drains, however, that health is lost forever.</p>\n<p>The idea is that this change SHOULD ideally do the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Encourage a players to move more, since there's now a time aspect to everything.</li><li>Discourage players from standing in rooms waiting for cooldowns.</li><li>Remove the deadlock that healing weapons/skills/items have over everything else.</li></ul>\n<p>Since I used my steam demo, there are some limitations, sorry, I tried to remove most of them, I'm not shilling I promise. You can technically play multiplayer but none of the changes have made their way in and they'll be pretty broken.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and please check out the options, there's a good chance a problem you have will already have a solution in the options menu.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c87/c87de7d07b63c19bc79517e7cc548566.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Untouch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
