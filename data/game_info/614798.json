Your flashlight battery is your healthbar.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was developed during the GameDev.tv Game Jam 2021 with the theme: \"<em>All that glistens is not gold</em>\". <br/><br/></p>\n<p>This is my first Game Jam and the first game I have ever released. I had a few more ideas to improve the game, but chose not to due to time and skill limitations.<br/></p>\n<p>Everything is self-made, including the graphics, sounds, music and scirpts. I used some youtube tutorial for the programming part.
