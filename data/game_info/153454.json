When I heard about the Gothic Novel Jam, I couldn't help but think about this play and what great subject matter it provided me. As someone that has an english degree, I've always found the Brontes to be hard to get into and I always wanted more post modern or post post modern lit. Noble, but hard to get into. Jen Silverman has changed that for me.\u00a0By pairing themes from the Theatre of the Absurd plus the backdrop of the Brontes' upbringing, plus the fun of a dark lesbian love triangle, I actually found the subject manner interesting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So this narrative game is an exploration inspired by that play. I used a combination of Twine for the narrative and Image to Bitsy + a little bit of editing in Bitsy for the imagery.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c3/3c37707fe012716c627e1f1fec820a5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["magicalbitch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
