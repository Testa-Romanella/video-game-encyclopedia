Using the schematics of a top-down movement engine as a grounds to work on, we didn't quite know what our game was. We entered development knowing we wanted to create a fast, frantic, but most of all, fun local-multiplayer game.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tAfter rapidly prototyping several multiplayer game ideas; we felt inspired to attempt the development of a sports game. The original concept for Fuball (dubbed \"Project Paddles\" at the time) was a top-down twin-stick sports game where each player was equipped with a paddle which they could use to hit the ball forward. However, after weeks of refinement and play-testing, it was decided that both this idea and the twin-stick control scheme simply didn't work.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSeveral months and countless prototypes later, we have Fuball. The product of months of experimentation and iteration. In October 2015, Fuball was selected to be presented at <em>GCAP 2015 Student Showcase</em> and is still in active development.</p><p>\r\n\tWe hope you enjoy!</p><p>\n<em>- Jack Sinclair and Jadd Zayed</em>\n</p><p><strong>\n<br/>\n</strong></p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/430eeeb02e39078a269109880fdb26a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Finger Candy"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
