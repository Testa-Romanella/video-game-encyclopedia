One player plays a small child while the other will be a whisp hovering around the other character, and urging him to explore an old abandonned house. The player playing the whisp should not see the screen and should wear headphones to have the output from the game. The other will have access to the screen and to the controller, but not to the headphones. The goal of this game is to understand the train of events that lead to the apparition of the whisp. To this end players will have to transmit information to one another as they both have only part of the whole solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong># Artists</strong></p>\n<p>\n<em>Alvyne Sebalj <br/>M\u00e9lanie L'huillier<br/>Ninon Godet</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong># Developers</strong></p>\n<p>\n<em>Hugo Attal<br/>K\u00e9vin Colombier<br/>Paul Niezborala<br/>Victor Rouquette</em></p>\n<p><strong># Sound designers</strong></p>\n<p><em>Edouard Bourgeat<br/>Elio Germani</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e58/e588748f7237cb4eccdcf2c1ed6d3567.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Herobrine"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
