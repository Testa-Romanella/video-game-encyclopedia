More skills are gained, as well as more people to use the skills. However, sometimes during skill usage these selves may bring up insecurities of theirs that cause problems.</p>\n<p>I intended to have 55 levels, but only got to about 10 before feeling burnt out and getting close to the deadline anyway. You'll at least understand what I was going for with what's finished. I learned a lot from this, and will release a completed version in the future.</p>\n<p>Expect a playthrough to take 10-20 minutes, depending on your reading speed and how you use skills.<br/>Thank you for looking, and I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>EDIT: Fixed a couple issues with how enemies weren't being processed properly. If you downloaded this and had problems, please try out the new version and let me know if they persist.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a0/8a0713d859c17fa56fc5752d258926a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CannibalInteractive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
