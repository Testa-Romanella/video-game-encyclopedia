I wish I could've started on it sooner, but alas... I didn't. If I had started on it sooner, I might have been able to make music for it! For now, though, it's pretty quiet. I think I'm gonna add music for it in the future!</p>\n<p>My game idea didn't have combat so the limitation kinda put some pressure on me, but I tried to incorporate the theme and limitation in the story, at least!</p>\n<p>This was really fun! I\u00a0<strong>really wish I could have made music for this</strong>. Anyway, I hope someone enjoys it!! If you find any bug, let me know!</p>\n<p>To make this game\u00a0I used Bitsy, Pixsy and Borksy,\u00a0and also the following\u00a0<strong>Bitsy</strong> hacks: \"Basic SFX\" and \"Transparent Sprites\", both\u00a0by Sean S. LeBlanc, and \"Favicom-From-Sprite\" by Mildmojo!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also used Krita for most of the art and\u00a0JFXR\u00a0for the sound effect!!\u00a0\u2728;\u00a07;</p>\n<p>Art, writing and sound design (as little of it as there is)\u00a0by me!! \u2764\ufe0f I had a lot of fun attempting more pixel art in this!\u00a0I have to improve a lot but it was fun!\u00a0Bitsy's restrictive 3-color palette made this a big challenge and I love it! ;\u00a0 7;\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T20:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9a/c9ab718f9be26f076b19239d5637b816.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MayhemCats"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
