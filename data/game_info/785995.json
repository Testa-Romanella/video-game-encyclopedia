Made in 4H46.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to manage the space so that people can live there. There will be more and more people needing a place to live, but the space available won't increase. Pretty much like it does on our planet.</p>\n<p>xxx<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How do I play?</strong></p>\n<p>You have to click on a tile then click on a free spot on the board. There's three types of tiles:<br/>-<strong>Lake</strong><br/>-<strong>Field</strong><br/>-<strong>House</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A house can host ten persons. To do so, a house has to be surrounded with at least two fields and one lake. Once the house fulfills these conditions, its appearance changes and the population number increases.</p>\n<p>You can place the first tile wherever you want, but the next ones are to be linked to what you already played. The tiles come in a random order.<br/></p>\n<p>Once you'll have reached the target number of population, you'll have a new board to fill with a greater target number.</p>\n<p>xxx<br/></p>\n<p>If you enjoyed the game or want to give us constructive advice, write us a <strong>comment</strong>!<br/>(and if you're taking part in the game jam, a vote would be appreciated!)</p>\n<p>xxx<br/></p><p>Graphics\u00a0 &amp; Music/Sound: Al\u00e9a</p><p>Code: Zelkior</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Happy-Rezoner<br/>Kim Lightyear<br/>Leszek Szary</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T07:05:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e7/3e7ed51e63692588c7dc8622f92da84a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zelkior"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
