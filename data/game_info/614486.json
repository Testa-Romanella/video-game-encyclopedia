Try to survive as long as possible.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Game's relevance to theme: In this game you play as a robot, where you break Asimov's 3 rules/laws of robotics by fighting against intelligent AI.<br/>The Ai will randomly patrol, and if caught will shoot on sight. But also go and take cover and call for backup(creates copy of itself) when its own health is low</p><p><em><strong>How the AI works:</strong><br/>- The enemy AI uses a Finite State Machine (FSM)<br/>- By default the enemy robots will wander around<br/>- If the player comes in the field of vision, they will switch to chase state and follow the player<br/>- Once close enough the enemy will start shooting the player<br/>\u00a0- If the enemy itself takes enough damage, it will try to take cover by finding the nearest safe cover spot<br/>- If it stays safe for some time without the player noticing, backup will be called (3 enemies are spawned)<br/>- The main of the player should be to prevent the enemy robot from going to safety and calling for backup whilst trying to complete the game in the quickest time possible</em><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Movement : W,A,S,D<br/>Dash : Left Shift<br/>\u00a0Attack: Left Mouse Button</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:25:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09d/09d9112a8e10cdc40ddb9d082c6b6b14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nexus of gaming"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
