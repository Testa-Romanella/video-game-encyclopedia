Just Press It!</p>\n<p>But in all truth, I made this game because while making Rob &amp; Bobberts I had trouble with making the UI, so I made a game solely based in the unity UI. I also challenged myself to make it within a short amount of time, so the game was made within 2 hours. It might not be a game you can play for hours, but if you have a few minutes to spare, try it!</p>\n<p>Also, if you want the Pixel Font, it is Thaleah by Tiny Worlds</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T11:27:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b8/2b8115bf45052d74e7aa748e6de8b3ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Fantorim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
