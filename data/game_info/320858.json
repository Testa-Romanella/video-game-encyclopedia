It is not gold we seek, but lemons!\"\r\nThe encounter with HMS Citra-Yus of the British Navy has turned out to be a grim one. As the sole survivor of the attack, it is up to you to wield that flintlock and hop into battle.\r\nBe aware, legend has is that the late captain of the ship, James Lemon roams the deck of that ship and will show up when the ship is threatened!\r\n\r\nThis is me submission for the MiniJam 28 with the theme of Pirates. It was honestly a blast making this thing in almost 3 days. Any comments or feedback will be highly appreciated!MovementWASD KeysAiming and ShootingMouseBeer?Replenishes Health!\r\n<p>Credits:</p>\r\nShip and Character SpritesBy 0x72:\u00a0https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-pirates-tilesetSound Effectshttps://freesound.org/Font - Alagardhttps://www.dafont.com/alagard.font", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a4df2969971bca30a69d7cfcc0c8662.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["adwitr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
