The coursework required us to make a game in C++ using an OpenGL based engine that our lecturer provided us with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fortunately by this time I had good experience working in C++, I had already completed two modules developing in C++ and I had experience working with the Unreal engine as part of my independent studies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a game made in under 6 weeks, I'm very proud of Deadlands Dragster. I'm most pleased\u00a0with how the player car controls and feels to drive, I put in a lot of effort to make it's movement satisfying for the player. As per our coursework requirements this game features primitive &amp; mesh based objects with correct transformations, textures and normals, multiple light sources, advanced physics, special effects and four differents NPCs with AI scripting.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n\n<p>Drive your car to the finish line as fast as possible and grab as many points as possible.</p>\n<p>Avoid obstacles: barrels are littered across the road, an enemy Racer will try and crash into you and an enemy Jeep will spawn barrels in your path.</p>\n<p>Grab Points: Grab as many coins as you can, the green Van will spawn coins but you have to stop it from escaping by 'corraling' it to the centre of the road.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>'Credits.txt' file included in zip.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/729/729e2370e4df41abcc3b6b6231bb8a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Graham"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
