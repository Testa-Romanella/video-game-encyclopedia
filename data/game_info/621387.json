Same goes for the sounds. Would have been nice to add some music but didn't have enough time for that.</p><p>Overall I am pretty happy with how my game turned out especially considering I didn't have even the 48 hours to make the game because I had other things to do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:35:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46e/46ec4249ed32b7d16b69d90745a05bdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MummunMussukka"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
