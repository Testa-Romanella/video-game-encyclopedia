Nobody could explain what happened ! Not even the city\u2019s wizard, who couldn\u2019t do anything to stop the creatures. He needs time to study them, he needs samples from them. But he can\u2019t do that all by himself ! So he called the best musicians et Dancing Stage champions (those famous japanese arcade games where you dance on arrowed platforms) to help him in this quest !<br/></p>\n<p><strong>HAVE FUN !</strong></p>\r\nCredit\r\n<p>Pixel-boy - Twitter- Tumblr</p>\n<p>AAA -\u00a0Tumblr</p>\n<p>Th\u00e9o Moyen - Music</p>\n<p>Video by\u00a0VariablePwn</p><p>Discord</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe37aea22f76ff4684b7881b9df3dd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pixel-boy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
