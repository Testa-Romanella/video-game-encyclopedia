Some would even say it was downright unfair. Orphan from a young age, they had to fight to earn a place in the world.

The next Oracle.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>A coveted position usually inaccessible to people like Briar, but who could oppose when the order comes from the highest power there is. What is seen by some as the coming of the end times might be the opportunity for Briar to show that although they may not be who the people want, they are what this world needs.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-Turn-based combat\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-Hand drawn portraits and art\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-Open world, letting you tackle quests in whichever order\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-No grind required\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-Intricate story and world building\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>- 1-2hrs of gameplay\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credit</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Art By yours truly\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Plugins from Visustella\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Iconset from Caz\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Support\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Making this art takes a lot of time.
