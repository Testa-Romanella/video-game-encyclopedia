This is a testbed of a variety of gameplay mechanics, such as an object that causes the player to\u00a0automatically swap, two panels that can enable/disable swapping, and a panel that limits the number of swaps possible.</p>\n<p>To swap, simply press the Space bar, and to sprint you can press Left Shift. To read signs, the default key is E. All of these are customizable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T09:32:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/156/1563e31f1ef1948a3bce3829c1a93ab7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShaneSmith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
