Actually, we just like sugar. And if you add Halloween candy to the equally sugar-filled sugar skulls of\u00a0D\u00eda de los Muertos, you get MORE SUGAR. We also like latin music. This game has\u00a0latin music in it. It's a rhythm game.</p>\r\nThe team:\r\n<p>These are their Discord names, by the way.
