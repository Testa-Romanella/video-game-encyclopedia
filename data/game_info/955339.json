Press the kick/swap button (S or 5 or End) to swap players when not in possession of the football.</p>\n<p>Moving without the ball costs 1MP per move; with the ball it costs 2MP.</p>\r\nSorry it's not very good!! :)\r\n<p><em>In fact, it probably doesn't even reach the minimum requirements of the jam :(</em></p>\n<p><strong>Nb.
