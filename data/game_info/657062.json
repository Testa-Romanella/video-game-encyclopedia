Each spawned nano-bot will increase the ambient heat in the environment.</p>\n<p>- If the environment gets too hot, you lose.</p>\n<p>- You will guide nano-bots using three commands: MOVE, EAT, ETCH</p>\n<p>- MOVE: Encourages a nano-bot to move to a specific location.</p>\n<p>- EAT: Encourages a nano-bot to \"eat\" a tile on the board. Eaten tiles are converted to energy. You can store a max. of 10 energy</p>\n<p>- ETCH: Builds a single wire on a tile. Connect a power source to a microchip by building a continious path of wires.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 Excess heat can be reduced with heat sinks. Heat Sinks cost 5 energy to build.</p>\n<p>- Occasionally nano-bots will malfunction. Malfunctioning nano-bots will destroy etched wire and ignore commands.</p>\n<p>- Malfunctioning nano-bots can be destroyed with turrets.</p>\n\n<p><em>NOTE: This game is free of price, but I don't gaurantee it's free of defects.
