Put the colored cubes in rows both horizontally and vertically. The completed series is erased and frees the place. Each figure occupies a certain number of cells horizontally and vertically. Your task is to arrange the pieces so that there is enough room. As soon as there are no free cells to install the figures the game will be completed. Transfer new shapes to the game field by dragging with the left mouse button.<br/>\r\n\u00a0 For the convenience of perception, two color schemes are available: black and white. The game keeps a record of your points and stores the best result.<br/>\r\nHave a good game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bdcb437697b579557a2da6d2bd48ec0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CASGames"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CASGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
