The player will need to use the upgrades to collect Water Buckets scattered around the level (2) and use them to get to the bomb and deactivate it. This is my first game and game jam so I encourage you to play through this! I made this using the free version of construct 3 so I was pretty limited and there really isn't much to do, but if you do end up liking it give me feed back!<br/><br/>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD + Space<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T04:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eca/ecacca4d177deadb7448f13f1ab2cec6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DogoBweadz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
