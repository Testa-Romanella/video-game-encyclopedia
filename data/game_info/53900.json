Originally released in November 1990, it featured a significant improvement in graphics (achieved through the introduction of VGA into the series). It was also the first King's Quest installment to replace the typing user interface with a point-and-click user interface. The title is a spoof on the proverb, \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\"</p>\n<p>King's Quest V sold over half million copies and won several awards. It was later released as a fully voiced \"talkie\" CD-ROM, done by members of the Sierra staff.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T00:29:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdc/fdc8e3ad4704f4e649004e727806b2e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.08, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 12, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC", "Classic Macintosh", "NES", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Sierra Entertainment", "Sierra On-Line"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Konami", "Sierra On-Line", "Sierra Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
