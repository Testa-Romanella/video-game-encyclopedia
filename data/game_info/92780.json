Crafting dead is WIP Android/PC game that combines basic Minecraft gameplay by day with more action based horde system during nights. Enemies really try to kill you and your home may be your castle, but if you don't fortify and protect it well, you will end up dead and without roof above your head.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt is smaller project but made with passion and still far from being complete - we are working on it every day and while we focus on Android version, we believe that it can be interesting even for PC gamers as it combines ideas from popular games like Minecraft or 7 days to die.\r\n</p>Survival mode<p>\r\n\tCrafting Dead isn't trying to beat Minecraft and other much bigger crafting/building games. It rather streamlines mining/crafting/buildings elements and focuses more on survival itself, mainly fighting hordes of enemies during nights that are much more dangerous than in other similar games.</p><ul>\n<li>Night enemy hordes that are more dangerous each day</li>\n<li>Enemies can and will destroy your buildings if they try to get to you</li>\n<li>Various building block</li>\n<li>Intuitive crafting system with crafting queue</li>\n<li>Various weapons</li>\n<li>Hunt animals to get food to heal yourself</li>\n<li>Lay traps for monsters lurking in the darkness</li>\n</ul>Creative mode<p>\r\n\tWhile game focuses on survival against stronger and stronger hordes of enemies, we still think that game should have a peaceful creative mode where you can build freely.\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>No enemies</li>\n<li>Unlimited resources</li>\n<li>All tools</li>\n<li>Instant block removing</li>\n<li>No fall damage</li>\n<li>Just your typical cubic playground!</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p>All feedback is highly appreciated, thank you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64eac7955b0181fa8777af087877c0b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alda Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
