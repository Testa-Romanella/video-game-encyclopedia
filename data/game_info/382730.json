Our user friendly drag and drop UI makes creating dungeons fun and easy!<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/>* Use the linking system to create puzzles and challenges! Link objects and enemies together to create logic that defines how puzzles are solved. We're creating the linking system with usability in mind. For example: link an enemy to a closed door, now that door will open when that enemy is defeated!<br/><br/>* Use items such as the bow and arrow, sword, bombs, lantern and more! More items will be added throughout development so we can create fun and varied experiences.<br/><br/>* Enemies are at your disposal each with unique characteristics. Blobs will wander aimlessly while Bats will chase the player if they get too close. Lizards will take aim and fire their bow at the player. More Enemies and Bosses will be added soon!<br/><br/><strong>Follow this page to keep up to date on announcements and news!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T02:18:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e6/5e640740a7f4a2f85abae1e4b582dfb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Squish Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Squish Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
