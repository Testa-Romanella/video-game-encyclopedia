This is more of an \"interactive cinematic\" than it is an actual game, but we hope you enjoy it anyway and promise to add more very soon!</p>\r\nA Note From the Developer\r\n<p>First of all, we want to deeply apologize to everyone who is let down by the fact that there is no actual gameplay. We agree, and in fact were saddened to release only what we consider an \"interactive cinematic.\" We worked hard and made a ton of content, including various levels, enemies, and hundreds of frames of animation. Unfortunately, due to time constraints along with technical difficulties we were unable to add that content in time for the deadline. Nevertheless,\u00a0 in the process of developing this game we fell in love with it and have tons of more content and features already made and in development as we speak. So we hope you will follow and stick around for future updates! Thank you for your consideration! Any and all feedback is welcome!</p>\r\nSummary\r\n<p>In a galaxy divided, various factions battle for control over the energy source used to fuel both ships and weapons. This energy source, known as \"ion,\" comes in various forms, or colors, that excel in specific uses. When a powerful organization learns of an ancient artifact said to possess the power to wield all ion types, they hire an outside agent to steal this artifact from its current keepers\u2014the Vormek. However, things take a turn for the worst when this hired thief is discovered and must now make an emergency escape with the Vormek close behind. With no help from the organization who hired her (for fear of starting a war), Mia is on her own as she tries to escape with the stolen artifact onboard. What\u00a0began as an ordinary heist for this spacefaring thief becomes a\u00a0\u00a0life-changing mission that will alter the galaxy forever ...</p>\r\nPlanned Features\r\n<p>Kroma will be a blended visual novel action RPG with some platformer elements.
