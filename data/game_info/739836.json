At each floor of the dungeon, there is a key which you must grab. In order to move on to the next floor down, you must open the door by throwing the key at it. Collect coins to increase your score. Avoid the red moving obstacles on along the way, as they will decrease your health. If your health goes to 0, you will die and respawn at the first level. You may restart the game at any level by going near the square bright teal gate.</p>\n<p>Once you are out, you are free to explore the beauty of the outside world, or you may play again if you so choose.</p>\n<p>Controls: Use the arrow keys to move around, the space bar to jump, and move your mouse around or move your fingers on your touchpad to pan the camera. Click on the key to grab it, and click again to release it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T05:04:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/929/929f045e14aed380b5d9d7e81d54bf76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mariasandu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
