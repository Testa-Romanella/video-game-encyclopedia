In Tower20, you take on the role of an adventurer who must save the universe from an evil Phoenix who sits at the top of a 20-story tower. The game starts off easy but gets increasingly more difficult as you advance through each floor. Battle against a dozen different monsters, using a basic attack, 2 abilities, 2 items and, if things take a turn for the worse, run from the battle and live to fight another day! Can you make it to the 20th floor and slay the Phoenix, or will you be reduced to mere ashes? This game is the ultimate way to kill 10 minutes for RPG fans!<br/><br/>No ads, no in-app purchases and bug fixes/updates ASAP!<br/><br/><br/>Level Up sound effect by AdamWeeden.<br/>http://www.freesound.org/people/AdamWeeden/<br/><br/>\"Tadaa\" sound effect by rdholder. <br/>http://www.freesound.org/people/rdholder/<br/><br/>Music by Scythuz.<br/>https://soundcloud.com/scythuz<br/><br/>The sound effects and music listed above are all licensed under this license:<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>Be sure to follow on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and YouTube and send any emails to vulturusdev@gmail.com!</p><p>http://vulturusdev.tumblr.com/</p><p>https://twitter.com/vulturusdev</p><p>http://youtube.com/vulturusdev</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Vulturus-Developmen...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/995/99508d401d99f588c6759622304b7b19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["VulturusDev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
