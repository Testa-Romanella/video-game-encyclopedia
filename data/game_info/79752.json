The game has only two possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who has rock will beat another player who has scissors (\"rock crushes scissors\") but will lose to one who has paper (\"paper covers rock\");a paper will lose to scissors (\"scissors cut paper\"). If both players have the same object, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T02:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2be/2beeabc8847401d18c516e4cccf0ac6a_yiyodtd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Georgi Zlatinov"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Georgi Zlatinov"], "esrb_rating": null}
