We worked as a team of 13, including Game designers, developers and artists.\u00a0We manage to do this prototype in 26 days of production. You play as Levia, an adventurer who host a symbiot-like entity that give her powers.</p>\n<p>The main feature of the game lies in the combat system which is the Symbiote gauge. Using empowered attacks and skills build this gauge, giving damage boost on a certain threshold, but fill the gauge will hinder the player, unable to attack, dodge and have reduced movement speed. The player must keep an eye on this resource, maintain it as high as possible without completely fill the gauge.<br/></p>\n<p>Here is the support we used for our final presentation, explaining our workflow and presenting the game.<br/>https://drive.google.com/file/d/17w32fOEwrCR7ZM7b2Jn3YtKzeJ-QHsA9/view</p>\n<p>I've put below the working documents of the parts I was working on\u00a0(sometimes with other colleagues), in French :</p>\n<p>Game Document :\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-rqAcjS072mfSu38AMSv1a4o9cMWP6yjJnL3lJgTxYc/...</p>\n<p>Combat Tweak Values :\u00a0https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cGiM5wKJovl9kRbm1QhCg_WHWTXUIggoVYzMfXku...\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>UI Mock ups :\u00a0https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13UvXvSNxO9rfT5DZgRl81C-aEC8o9XcV</p>\n<p>Narrative World Building :\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1roRirSQDZ8-OvpwRXkRNevUbMBxh2ptwkwo8Fz_mlag/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:56:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b0/2b0d5458b6e3ed634f6749272446b14a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JeremyOssolaGD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
