Several camps of workers were situated along the Tsavo River in Kenya to build the railroad. Starting in March 1898, two male lions terrorized the camps for months, killing an amount of people still unknown today. In 2017, a study found that one of the lions had an infection in its tooth, making it difficult for it to hunt and eat.</p>\n<p>You will play that lion. Using the arrow keys, you can move the arrow around. Be stealthy and avoid getting caught while meeting the goal number of prey displayed at the top right corner. Once you\u2019ve reached the goal, you need to return to the den as fast as possible. Additionally, you\u2019re sick and malnourished so sometimes you will have trouble moving and there will be nights where you will hardly be able to see. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68bebff3a15787c417859e5497c469b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wong.ashton"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
