While making this game we decided to focus on the theme of \"Opportunity\" and \"Equality!\"\u00a0 \u00a0Looking at our current situation, it is apparent that despite everyone being equal some of us are not treated as such. Keeping this is in mind, we've made a game where it allows the opportunity to help those that are being treated unfairly. Through our game mechanics it is apparent that one character has a lot more of advantages than the other. It is up to the player with these privileges to help the other player escape hell or escape it alone.\u00a0 We hope to promote the idea of helping others, especially those who have more opportunities than others. Our main goal for this game jam was to express: You can use opportunities\u00a0to achieve equality. Opportunity in this case can mean simply working together or helping someone. If we continue on with this mindset, hopefully we'll be able to achieve equality for all no matter the color of your character.\u00a0<br/><br/>Credits:\u00a0<br/>Programming:\u00a0Edilio Ver, Rodrigo Okamoto<br/>Art: Valeria Trevino, Jake Nguyen\u00a0<br/>Music: Elian Sweeten\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T03:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88b/88b5232d2ef955e3a90aff3c6c22ed1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["elian sweeten", "valeria_trevino", "jake nguyen", "Rodrigo Okamoto", "edivera"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
