It is a \"roguelike\" style of game, which means that it:<br/><br/><ul><li>emphasizes gameplay over graphics, using an extended Petscii character set rather than bitmap graphics;<br/></li><li>is turn-based and allows the player to stop and resume at virtually any point; and<br/></li><li>rewards mastery of the game mechanics and encourages multiple playthroughs.</li></ul><br/>ArmCom2 features ten campaigns set between 1939 and 1945, and hundreds of vehicles, guns, and infantry unit types. The terrain map for each combat day and the types of enemies you encounter are procedurally-generated, which means that each playthrough of a campaign will bring new and unexpected challenges. Your commander and crew gain experience and can improve their stats and gain skills over time, but they are also vulnerable to injury and may be seriously wounded or killed during the course of a campaign.<br/><br/>All in-game displays are generated using a modified Petscii character set, as used in the Commodore 64, and sound effects are also generated using samples from the C64's SID sound chip.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T05:10:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e7/0e78c02ca2192ffdd7dae66748182ee1.jpg", "website": "https://www.armouredcommander.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 52, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gregory Adam Scott"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Gregory Adam Scott"], "esrb_rating": null}
