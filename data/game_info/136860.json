Multiple types of towers, multiple types of enemies, cash to build and upgrade a tower, get cash back for selling a tower, take damage if enemies pass trough.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe camera in the wave phase is terrible... I planned it to fly through the maze along with enemies... =/\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI hope to enjoy someone with this game, but to be honest, I achieved my goal of creating a Unity3D game from scratch, and the 64px constraint made everything really joyful!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI'll let people vote for a while before changing some game mechanics (hey, i'ts not fair if I update it after de deadline, right?! ;D ) but I'll try to fix any crash or blocking bugs ASAP.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThanks!<br/>\r\n\tNemoStein\r\n</p>2016-04-13 - Devlog 5<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tSo, today is UI day! I tried my best to make a minimal UI that can fit in the 64x64 resolution and don't disrupt the gameplay. Tomorrow I'll implement it.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe render resolution is working and the pixel font is ready.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tI'm struggling with lightning and shadows, though... I'm pretty sure I'll sort it all later.\r\n</p>2016-04-12 - Devlog 4<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tAfter 9 days lost in the dead zone, Minibit is back... With Creeps!\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tToday I got my way around and added enemy waves.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlso, I took project's first screenshots!\r\n</p><p>\n</p>2016-04-03 - Devlog 3<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tNice progress today! I've managed to create some basic camera controls for build and wave phases and a path finding algorithm (A*). Also, I got a nice grid laid down to show where you can put your towers.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTomorrow I'll try to implement some basic (placeholder) models and hopefully my first wave of creeps!\r\n</p>2016-04-02 - Devlog 2<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tToday was a bit technical day, 'cause all I've done was set up my environment in Unity.\r\n</p>2016-04-01 - Devlog 1<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tJust started the game from scratch! This gonna be a good test on my skills with Unity3D (never made anything with it)...\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMinibit is a 3D Tower Defense with really small graphics (is a #LOWREZJAM after all)!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d5b5bc363ba34262512170aa129aa22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NemoStein"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
