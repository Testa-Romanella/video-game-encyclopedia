Instead, you will have to complete the tasks, solve puzzles while keeping an eye on someone who's watching you. Use your phone's flashlight to navigate (not to blind someone), CCTV cameras to keep safe, and other necessary items that will help you in your journey or survival, rather. The game will also require you to behave a certain way, be stealthy and cautious.<br/><ul><li>Look for tasks in the environment. Different ones will require you to use logic, math, memory, and visual cues.<br/><br/></li><li>Some things won't be obvious to you without certain items. Always be on the lookout and use what you've got.<br/><br/></li><li>Other things will require maintenance so you can continue with what you're doing.<br/><br/></li><li>You don't have all the time in the world, though. Better have a spot to hide.<br/></li></ul><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1909090/Kapellmeister/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T05:02:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c9/9c9ed6a3129ee9e69b611f872155c1f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eevoe"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["eevoe"], "esrb_rating": null}
