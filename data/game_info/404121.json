He normally goes to rich neighborhoods to steal things from wealthy homes. Once his mom confronts him about it, Kelvin storms off. He then goes to another wealthy neighborhood to steal things but is quickly discovered by others. He runs a way but\u00a0then there is an\u00a0earthquake. Kelvin then falls down a pit and finds himself in a cavern. Now he has to find his way out. \u00a0While in the cave, Kelvin finds out that there is treasure that's worth a lot of money down in the cavern.\u00a0\u00a0So Kelvin decides to find the treasure first before he finds a way out of the cavern. But there are some strong people looking for the treasure as well.</p>\n\n<p>This is a demo (clearly) and very early stage of development so there may be some bugs. My goal with this project is to have completely rid of any default RTP and make this game look unique. I would love to work with some talented artist, music/sound, and coders on this project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T03:10:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fd/8fd05318ac289d3a83a81690d177a64b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drei7717"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
