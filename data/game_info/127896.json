So make sure they always have someone around them to keep them happy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dev note:</strong>\u00a0I'm afraid I couldn't spend much time on this prototype, so winning condition and other mechanics are not implemented yet, sorry!</p>\n<p>You can test the slime hivemind movement, though, which is the core of the game.</p>\n<p>Try to create your own challenges, for now. For instance, try to shape your body as a \"C\", \"T\", \"L\", \"+\"... Or try getting all the slimes from one side of the level to the other, or lining them all up against a wall.</p>\n<p>Expect cool features in the future, like having to align many slimes in order to cross a gap without falling!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ff/1ff415f8c414f359f9c6e9492804a49b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NAVAZA"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
