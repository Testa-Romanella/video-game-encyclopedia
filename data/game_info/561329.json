Together, you will reach the food and be filled with determination.</p>\n<p>Expect many many MANY bugs, graphical errors and problems all throughout. Do not fret because these are features, the only bugs here are the ants.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:45:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a587a75b26945eb5aaf59327bfda9487.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["prchristie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
