This was mainly a learning project for us. You can pick a character of your choice then are thrown into the fire! You are allowed to pick up a weapon of your choice and destroy the enemies that are coming at you. Each enemy will give you score and money, at the end of the wave/day you are allowed to upgrade your stats. See how high of a score you can get!</p>\n<p>------<br/></p>\n<p>First game that I have ever made. <br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Ramon for teaching me a whole lot.\u00a0 <br/><br/>This project was to just learn and get a grasp of the engine jumping straight in. With the many ideas we have with this game we would love to continue but it is best to take this as a learning experience and create new games.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>------<br/></p>\n<p>*Credits*</p>\n<p>Ryan Borbone : Lead Designer, Lead Artist, Lead Sound &amp; Music, Programmer</p>\n<p>Ramon Meza:\u00a0 Lead Programmer, Designer</p>\n<p>Eddie Chace: Voice Actor <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5e/a5eb479e4e7aa8f673c223f23aeed83f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Borbone"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
