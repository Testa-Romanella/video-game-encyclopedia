They no longer have to share their eggs with anyone else. But there are some who desire their eggs, who might try to take them by force. Luckily they are prepared for this.<br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The game starts in BUILD mode. While in this mode, you can spend eggs to build fences, using the controls near the top of the screen.<br/>When you are done, click \"start wave\". You will be unable to build while in WAVE mode. You can see information about the current wave in the left panel. There are a total of 25 waves.<br/></p>\n<p>One more thing: you can drag your chickens to any fence you placed at any time! While they are in the coop, they are inactive but will produce eggs for you.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>V\u00e9el: code &amp; game design</p>\n<p>lapspider45: music, sound, game design &amp; cover art</p>\n<p>Leno: playtest<br/></p>\n<p>Art assets used:\u00a0 <br/>\"Animated Wild Animals\" by https://opengameart.org/content/animated-wild-animals <br/></p>\n<p>\"Paid RPG Pixel Art Assets 2\" by https://edslashem.itch.io/rpg-asset-pack-2</p>\n<p>\"1000+ Egg Sprites\" by https://taarna23.itch.io/1000-egg-sprites</p>\n<p>\"Heart 16*16\" by https://opengameart.org/content/heart-1616</p>\n<p>\"Fully Animated Pixel Chicken\" by https://awkward-berd.itch.io/fully-animated-pixel-chicken<br/></p>\n<p>Tileset by lapspider45</p>\n\n<p>Source code available under the MIT license (open-source, do whatever you want with it) at https://github.com/vlbeaudoin/egg-td/<br/></p>\n<p>Music is also available under CC BY-SA 4.0 at https://lapspider45.bandcamp.com/album/fort-benedict.
