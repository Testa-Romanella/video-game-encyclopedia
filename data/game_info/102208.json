My objective was to make a walking simulator with a sprinkle of story elements. The original version of the game \r\n\t<em>(v.0.0.98)</em> was debuted on May 6th, 2015.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>theWanderer is, as I would say, \"a poor man's love letter to NaissanceE.\"<p>\r\n\tLimasse Five's \r\n\tNaissanceE was a huge influence on me in the making this game. A minimalist appearance, a heavy use of lighting, and complex architecture played a huge role in the development of theWanderer.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>theWanderer is still very much a work-in-progress.<p>\r\n\tThe game is rather simple, so all you'll need to be using is \r\n\t<strong>WASD, LShift, Spacebar, and Mouse</strong>. Doors even open on their own if you walk near them. Pretty basic.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game is \r\n\t<strong><em>still</em> un-optimized out the wazoo</strong>. Despite some minimal in-game settings, the game will most likely make your computer shed a tear. I made and tested tW on a GTX780 and still have to crank the fans up pretty good.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game was in production from April 2015 to September 2015; During the time, I educated myself on Unreal 4.6, built the game from scratch over a single month, and kept polishing it for a while. The game is rather barebones and can be completed leisurely in ~15+ minutes and speedran in ~4 minutes. The story is served in the form of subtitles with no voiceover; I'm a designer, not a voice actor.\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>theWanderer's progress, as well as my other work, can be found/followed here.<p>\r\n\tOh hey, it's a Twitter account...\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Changelog:<p>\r\n\tv0.0.98:\r\n</p>\r\n\tOriginal fully-playable build \r\n\t<em>(not public)</em>\n<p>\r\n\tv0.0.99:\r\n</p>\r\n\tAdded various post-processing\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tStage 1 detail overhaul\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAdded options menu \r\n\t<em>(wowie!)</em>\n<p>\r\n\tv0.1.0:\r\n</p>\r\n\tAdded level streaming\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAdded a new level\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tRevamped the menus\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tVarious bug fixes\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAdjusted lighting and how 'bronze' the game was\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tSmoothed level transitions\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAdded more game audio\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tOther various tweaks\r\n<p>\r\n\tv0.1.1\r\n</p>\r\n\tA single level expansion\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tIn-world text to replace some subtitles\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAdded LevelReset button to pause menu\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tSlightly more compliant doors and slight lighting tweaks", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f6/4f6325ffb625d39a64bf65f7a5184912.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Douglasian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
