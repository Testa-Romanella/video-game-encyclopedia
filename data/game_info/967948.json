The game's release date has been moved to <strong>October 17, 2023</strong> to allow for additional debugging as much as possible.<br/>Announcement 2. Laststand Mode has been added!!<br/><br/><br/>Laststand Mode is a new gameplay mode in addition to Campaign Mode. You and 4 adventurers and only 1 village. You must protect from the tireless army of the night and save the village and the 4 people. Will you be able to protect them from the nightmare night.!!<br/><br/><br/>(Sep 29, 2023) What is the Concept of the Gemini Flame RPG world? <strong>(these 5 Main features are now available in the GeminiFlame : Alpha Dragon ver 1.0.0.!!).</strong><br/>It started when I asked myself \u201cWhy I need to spend days for one Level?\u201d, \u201cWhy I need to walk between a city and dungeon for resupply?\u201d, \u201cWhy I need to roaming around the RPG world for catch all side quest?\u201d, \u201cWhy I always see ultimate potion and skill spamming for an eternity in every fight moment?\u201d and \u201cWhy would I build a city and farm in the RPG game?\u201d.<br/><br/><strong>5 Questions and this game in your hands is born.</strong> And for asking my question, I changed the rules in my RPG game by<br/><br/><strong>1.Remove Leveling system always from my RPG game and use the certification system</strong>: The Certification system is giving a point to up skill similarly to the leveling system. But you only get [Certificate points] by just progress a quests or unlock conditions. So you don\u2019t need to spend a lot of time on many quests for just one level.<br/><br/><br/><strong>2.Remove Roaming side quest always from my RPG game and use the Documentation system</strong>: The Documentation system works similarly to the Achievement unlock system. But in addition, you also get text stories to read about this world and give you rewards such as [Certificate points] After unlocking. So, you can complete the challenge anywhere and anytime.<br/><br/><br/><strong>3.Remove Fighting inventory always from my RPG game and use the 6 of skill General slots system</strong>: So you can\u2019t spam potions and skills. Because all 6 slots are the quota for setting skills and food in single battle. So, you will need to resupply. Recheck your gear or change your skill settings for each battle.<br/><br/><br/><strong>4.Remove City Tycoon always from my RPG game and use the Construction system</strong>: Why you need to set an area for building something in the RPG game? Why do you have to decide where to place your house?. In this game, NPCs will build their own town by themselves and provide [Benefits] to your characters. Additionally, if you want to build that gives you the [Benefits] you want, you can cooperate with NPCs to build by [Donating] them.<br/><br/><br/><strong>5.Adding Split and join party system</strong>: Why don\u2019t you leave someone behide in the city and send a supply into your inventory? You can divide the team into two or three groups to do different activities. Or characters join together to fight monsters.<br/><br/><br/><strong>5 Concepts, 4 Removes and 1 added features.
