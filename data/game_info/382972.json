So now you can pass scene 10.</p>\n<p><strong>Details\u00a0</strong>:</p>\n<p>Puzzle game inspired by 'Dead Eye' from Red Dead Redemption and the slow down mechanic from Super Hot.</p>\n<p>Hold 'Right Click' to slow down time, then while\u00a0holding it 'Left Click' to set a path to move.\u00a0Releasing the slow down will move you to each point! But you can slow down mid movement to maintain momentum.</p>\n<p>Avoid enemies, walls and reach the end portal! Good luck, level's 11 and 12 are VERY hard. My thumb hurts now. <strong>See if you can beat my score, shown as one of\u00a0the screen shots.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T03:53:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad44b152f628f3b55978c15d7ce5a126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coder-Jet"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
