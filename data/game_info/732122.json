It is controlled with WASD as movement, Space for selection, Backspace for deselect, and P for pause.</p>\n\n<p>In this game, you have a team of units that you use to fight many waves of enemies. Over time, you gain more units and your units get stronger. But if your units are defeated in battle, they will be gone forever. Build a team of strong units and survive for as many days as possible.</p>\n<p>Right now there is no music for the game. That may change in the future, but right now I am focusing on ensuring the game works and has few bugs.</p>\n<p>If the web version has bugs then just try downloading.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T14:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45d/45dee1ff040410009d19634ef6cdd5dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ThatANonoWord"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
