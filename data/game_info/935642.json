On your way home to feed your cat Kuma, you stumble upon a vending machine in a dark alley.\r\n\r\nThis game should take around 60 minutes to complete.\r\nAs this is meant to be played in one setting, you cannot manually save. The game does save between endings, so if you close while at the main menu, you can pick up where you left off, but there's no way to save during each playthrough.\r\nThere are no jump scares but there are some light visual effects like screen tearing and glitches.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- ~7k words\r\n- working vending machine\u00a0\r\n- 4(?) distinct endings depending on player choice\r\n- cat\r\n<p><strong>Trigger warnings for alcohol use and discussion of pet loss.</strong></p>\n<p>additional credits:</p>\n<p>font is\u00a0monogram</p>\n<p>3d models</p>\n<ul><li>vending machine</li><li>alleyway</li></ul>\n<p>additional audio from freesound.org</p>\n<ul><li>meow</li><li>popcorn</li><li>vending machine</li><li>bottle</li><li>bag</li><li>soup</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T16:23:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b51e407f7d6fd45e4a708ab250de0c6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["beepsalt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
