You can click and drag the lander to move it. Then, to get more ore miners (light blue, cost 10 ore, 1 ore every 5 seconds) click on one after you get 10 ore. Don't forget to press qwertyuiop at the beginning, because it will build more collection rovers (grey rover cost 20 ore and produces 2 ore per 4 seconds, yellow miner cost 30 ore and produces 1 gold per 5 seconds, green miner cost 10 gold and fifty ore and mines 1 regolith every 5 seconds, dark blue miner cost 10 regolith, 30 gold and 100 ore and collects 1 obsidian ore per 5 seconds, and that is all the qwertyuiop miners.) After you get more obsidian miners and enough research, collected by people, you can get a steel factory (green), which turns 5 obsidian into 1 steel every 10 seconds. To get another, you will need 5 steel. You can also get a steel miner for 50 steel and mines 1 steel per 5 seconds. After a little while, you will get a black and grey factory which generates 1 oil per 10 seconds out of 5 steel. Getting another of these factories costs 5 oil. You can also get a black miner that mines 1 oil every 5 seconds, which costs 50 oil.</p>\n<p>\u2b50= project that I worked hard on</p>\n<p>TIP: get as much panel power as possible, as it will pave the way to transcendence... when I say a lot, I mean a LOT (500,000)</p>\n<p>TIP #2: get as much raw ore and sand as possible to build up your sandbags to stop the flood</p>\n<p>ps: press qwertyuiop at beginning</p>\n<p>z: show variables</p>\n<p>x: hide variables</p>\n<p>click: buy another</p>\n<p>q= ore miner (grey, 20 ore)</p>\n<p>w= gold miner (gold, 30 ore)</p>\n<p>e= regolith miner (green, 10 gold, 50 ore)</p>\n<p>r=obsidian miner (bluish-greenish, 30 gold, 100 ore, 10 regolith)</p>\n<p>y= steel miner(purple, 50 ore)</p>\n<p>u= oil miner (black, 50 oil)</p>\n<p>a= show knowledge graph</p>\n<p>s= hide knowledge graph</p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 --------------------Updates--------------------</p>\n<p>1.40.1 bug fixes</p>\n<p>1.40.0: added a warning message at beginning, added new achievement</p>\n<p>1.39.9: added more lore, changed update log</p>\n<p>1.38.9 bug fixes</p>\n<p>1.38.8: added more achievements cuz why not</p>\n<p>1.37.8 bug fixes</p>\n<p>1.36.8 : Story Achievements added, larger versions of achievements that can be removed by clicking them</p>\n<p>1.35.8 : capitol building and solar panels now have to be unlocked using ore, also changed some things that makes the elements of the game work better together</p>\n<p>1.34.8 beta: added an unbreakable red metal alloy of a thousand substances all around the universe called Unmeracictanium , and to craft this medal forged by the gods themselves, you need a Unmeracictanium Nerioniver, a furnace with the power to melt planets trillions of light years away.
