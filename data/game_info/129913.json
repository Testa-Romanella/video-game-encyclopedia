I have updated the gameplay proposed in the tutorial. I have developped a navigation framework which allows to switch from one game screen to another and a basic graphical user. There is now a \"ladder\" mechanism which allows to save player highscore on internet. You have also some achievements based on your highscore which allow unlocking 3 more playable ships.</p><p>Don't forget that you can select the EASY mode on the start screen to play this game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c55a0feef109693ae21b33e0b3041b02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stele"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
