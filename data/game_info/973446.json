Every player will be able to play it and see what awaits them in the full version of the game.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You're an ambitious contractor with a passion for repair shops. The task seems simple, but is it really? Will you handle demolishing walls without having the roof collapse on your head? Can you give them a nice, even paint job? Starting's always tricky but remember \u2013 practice makes perfect!<h3>CLEAN UP</h3><br/><br/>Many people treat their garage like a dumpster and, unfortunately, before you can get to decorating the interior, you'll first have to liberate it from old junk. Rusty mufflers, used-up batteries, shelves of empty cans, as well as old fridges and washing machines are just some of the things people tend to stuff and forget in their garages. Sort the recovered materials or try to sell them to scrap collectors.<h3>REMAKE THE GARAGE</h3><br/>Go for your hammer and bust open the old walls! You can make rooms bigger by building new ones and installing new roofs and floors. Choose your preferred paint color and soon you'll see new life breathed into the garage!<h3>BUY NEW FURNITURE</h3><br/>Place a brand new workbench and tool cabinets, as a more expensive preset, or create a collection yourself by laying out tools individually. Remember that everything needs its proper spacing and placement.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T03:41:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a9/1a9e00532ab7487ac33c42be294734ea.jpg", "website": "https://games-i.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 19, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Farmind Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay", "Games Incubator"], "esrb_rating": null}
