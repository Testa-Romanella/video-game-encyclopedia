And I hoped that this same action would be lived with the maximum intensity by future participants. It was necessary that it be purely gratuitous, and that you not attempt to know--as you were cutting--what you were going to cut after nor what you had already cut.\" </em>-Lygia Clark, Nostalgia of the Body <br/></p><p>This is a local co-op abstract art maker.
