Ggreed, Puig, Margo and their Space Junkie associates stumble upon a rare substance that is far greater in worth than any other ill-gotten gain they could imagine\u2026 Cheesecake! This mysterious fuel, however, isn\u2019t kept secret for long. Ggreed and the gang find themselves competing with the Russian Mob, Bounty Hunters, Wiley Witches and even Inter-dimensional Aliens for the illustrious (and luminous) prize. Through it all, the Space Junkies have to fight off a slew of ghastly creatures such as zany Zombies, slimy Slugs, dastardly Dino-Dragons, vicious Vampires, Purple Apes and other nightmarish nasties. The race is on! And the outcome is either unequaled wealth and galactic domination\u2026 or death!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcfbb19b001ba8348d79834b6888a2a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sk101"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
