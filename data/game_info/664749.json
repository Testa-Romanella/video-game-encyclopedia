A bloke that for some reason has a rocket tied to his back, and now he must try and get through levels of ever-increasing difficulty while collecting diamonds that he hopes to spend and Jerry Cans to fuel his rockets; avoiding hazards along the way.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0very simple runner that was built over the course of few days as part of a programming test I\u00a0took part in. Releasing it here because I really like what I've made, and I kind of want to gauge if I should continue to develop this game into a full game for both the PC and Mobile Phones.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>\n<p>Get to the end of each level by using your Rocket Pack to avoid hazards, and gaps in the level. Falling into the water will result in the death of Rocket Bloke!!</p>\n<p>Along the way, make sure to collect as many diamonds as you can and once near the end of the level try and land on the highest multiplier possible for a higher score! Also, don't forget to collect Jerry Cans to keep your rocket fuel up!!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\r\nA KEYMOVE LEFT\u00a0D KEYMOVE RIGHTSPACEBARUSE ROCKET PACK\r\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>A Game Programmed &amp; Designed by Adam Tedder (https://www.adamtedders.co.uk/)</p>\n<p><strong>ASSET PACKS USED</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Rocket Bloke Model From Mixamo (https://www.mixamo.com/)</p>\n<p>Low Poly Rock Pack - https://brokenvector.itch.io/low-poly-rock-pack\r\n  </p>\n<p>AllSkyFree \u2013 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/allsky-free-10-sky-skybox-set-146014   </p>\n<p>Bitgem Water \u2013 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/urp-stylized-water-shader-proto-series-187485   </p>\n<p>Epic Game Hits SFX \u2013 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/epic-game-hits-sfx-36617   </p>\n<p>Footsteps \u2013 Essentials \u2013 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/foley/footsteps-essentials-189879   </p>\n<p>Hand Painted Wood Texture \u2013 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/wood/hand-painted-seamless-wood-texture-vol-6-162145   </p>\n<p>Outline Toolkit \u2013 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/outline-toolkit-98020   </p>\n<p>Stylized Lava - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/stylized-lava-materials-180943\r\n  Free Music Tracks - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/free-music-tracks-for-games-156413</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:49:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01a3eeafb3df88955f8955ba32f98e51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Adam Tedder"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
