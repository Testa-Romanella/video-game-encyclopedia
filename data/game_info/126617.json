They can push you around, and force you out of the organs you need to defend, though, and they're decaying away the organs they're inside!</p>\n<p>Livers spawn enemies that spawn more enemies! Target them first!</p>\n<p>Hearts and Brains are sensitive! Avoid hitting the walls, and make sure to beat the infections fast before they start hitting the walls!</p>\n<p>Your Space attacks are powerful, but have cooldowns! Each cooldown has it's own sound to indicate when it's ready to use again, so swap your weapons freely to make use of all of them!</p>\n<p>If you fail to beat an organ before it is lost to infection, don't worry, just keep going!
