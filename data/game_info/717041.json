Fling yourself into 60 massive puzzle levels. Stack blocks, dodge cops, die to progress, and discover the secrets of the afterlife.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/>The Godkiller features creative new twists on classic puzzle mechanics. Instead of pushing blocks, throw them - and yourself - across entire levels, and stack them vertically to open new routes. Instead of fearing death, embrace it by killing your character to respawn her in better locations. Many more hazards and contraptions await, to be dodged or turned to your advantage.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/>You will play as Emm, a newly-dead soul who is greeted by God himself. God's plans conflict with Emm's independence, and she swiftly collects enemies.
