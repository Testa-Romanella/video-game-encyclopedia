You need to control the character to run or fly for as long as possible. The road is full of thorns and obatacles. It requires you to react quickly to avoid obstacles and collect stars. Stars can redeem skins for your characters in the shop. \r\nThe game is divided into four difficulty levels. Game scenes will be randomly generated.
