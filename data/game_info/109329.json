So do your best and don't let Bunny's fans down!</p><p>And remember, if you get an S grade you can unlock some special costumes, so keep practicing!</p><p>Changes since the last demo:</p><p>+ Added Easy mode</p><p>+ Added alternative control schemes in the Settings page</p><p>+ New secret costume<strong>s(!)</strong></p><p>+ Redid every animation (though I'll say now some look even worse than the old ones, fucking arm IK how does it work)</p><p>+ a bunch of code refactoring and some minor improvements</p><p>This may be the last demo I put out for this game, as I've gotten kind of burnt out.
