Because mastering the game is truly challenging:<br/><br/><ul><li>Controlling the ball is hard. <br/></li><li>There are no explanations. <br/></li><li>You die all the time. <br/></li><li>The game just hates the player! </li></ul><br/>Few players make it through all levels, almost none through the hardmode. Some love it, many despise it. But one thing is truly satisfying \u2013 beating that one level that just drove you nuts! <br/><br/>Elevators, keys, activators, traps, physics and gravity bring complexity to the game.
