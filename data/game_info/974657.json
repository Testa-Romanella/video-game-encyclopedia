{"id": 974657, "slug": "awfulmon", "name": "AWFULMON", "name_original": "AWFULMON", "description": "<p>Awfulmon is a turn-based combat game along the lines of Pokemon or the older Final Fantasy games. There are two gameplay modes, Tournament Challenge and Practice Fight. In Tournament Challenge, you must fight your way through all 10 characters (broken up into two different &quot;badge&quot; groups) and one top secret boss who will probably kill you a lot. In Practice Fight, the computer will choose a random opponent for you to fight, but you will only receive 1/3rd the points as fighting an opponent in Tournament Challenge mode. Losing a battle will subtract 100 points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-05T22:02:00", "background_image": null, "website": "https://web.archive.org/web/20020601114305/http://www.somethingawful.com/awfulmon/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
