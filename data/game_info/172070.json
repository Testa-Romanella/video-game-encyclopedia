The ball will slowly fall until it touches the ground. Then you will be able to control it. You must reach the big gate in the picture and go beyond it. </p><p>The maze consists of walls, gates. You will need a key to open a gate. You will find them exploring the maze. There are obstacles like arrows (which freeze you for 3 seconds then disappear), green areas which freeze you for 1 second and red areas which randomize your movement for 1-2 seconds.</p><p>At the end you will see how much time you needed to escape.
