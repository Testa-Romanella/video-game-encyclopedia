It\u2019s a first-person puzzle game, inspired by titles such as <strong>Closure</strong> and <strong>Antichamber</strong>.</p><p>In the game, lights and shadows play an important role. The player\u2019s goal is to escape a gloomy asylum/prison, to get to \u201cthe other side\u201d, by solving puzzles that utilize lights and shadows in various ways. The goal is to make players think in a new way; that they change their mental models regarding lights and shadows in videogames.</p><p>Being a university project, we worked with the following problem statement:</p><p><em>PROBLEM STATEMENT</em></p><p><em>We assume a 3D game universe with some core rules: in this world, you \u2013 the player \u2013 don\u2019t collide with unlit parts of surfaces, and you don\u2019t cast a shadow.</em></p><p><em>Do players of the game who are not told the rules understand it just as well or better than players who are told the rules in the beginning of the game?</em></p><p><em>Do they enjoy the game more or less if they are not told the rules in the beginning?</em></p><p>The game has been mentioned on\u00a0Gameplay and\u00a0IndieStatik.</p><p>Read more about the game here:\u00a0GustavDahl.net/see-you-on-the-other-side</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>Benjamin Nicholas Overgaard</p><p>Gustav Dahl</p><p>Lasse Von Fintel Sostack</p><p>Mathias Klitgaard Berthelsen</p><p>Philip Hundevad Nymann</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d499a677c30502012d0a1f479e77da6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wikzo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
