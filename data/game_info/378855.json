Below is how I create my .lua files to parse through my geometry. Since each vertex has an X,Y,Z, I thought it would be smarter to label them rather than just send them anonymous values, which is not the same for the index array, hence that particular lua table is anonymous.</p><p>2. The way you control the game is: Pressing right key to move in positive X direction, and pressing left key to move camera in negative x.\u00a0</p><p>3. Human readable files in this instance are very useful and preferred because of the easy readable nature that they possess, and the ease of access and the ease of editing that they provide. We can just change vertex values in a file and without changing any C++ code those changes will reflect in our game.\u00a0Thats pretty awesome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T03:51:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b4/2b4ebe6b983d1b3672cdbfe0dab5d728.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pinakj"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
