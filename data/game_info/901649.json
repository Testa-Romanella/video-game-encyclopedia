Consider it the 12 days of Christmas, although there are actually 15 artworks not 12. But it is also the 12th game in the series, so it's kind of like a \"pun\".<h3>Key features:</h3>\ud83d\udc1d 1500+ bees<br/><br/>\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f 15 unique artworks<br/>\ud83d\udca1 \u221e Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br/>\u267b\ufe0f Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br/>\ud83c\udf6f Additional bee related objects to find<br/>\ud83c\udfb5 Music and ambiance for each artwork<br/>\u2328\ufe0f Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br/>\ud83d\udcbe 3x save slots<br/>\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Reset progress entirely and play again<br/>\ud83d\udd52 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<br/>\ud83c\udf81 New level unlocked each day (optional).<h3>Context:</h3>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy Christmas/winter world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 15 art pieces to choose from, and 1500+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h3>Controls:</h3>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h3>Difficulty:</h3>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked*, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h3>Get immersed:</h3>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h3>Replayable</h3>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T04:47:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7b/e7b81a2cf2b532127d70ac61d0de91e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Follow The Fun"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Follow The Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
