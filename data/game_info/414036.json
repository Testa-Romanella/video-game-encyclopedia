NO\u00a0MORE! PacMan has armed himself to the brim with weaponry and this includes: Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, Airstrikes, Attack Dogs and even NUKES! The Ghosts are in for a real treat!</p>\n<p>In this unique take on PacMan, the old retro game that everyone loves and knows, you can win in two ways: Collecting all the pellets on each map OR the more explosive way, getting the NUKE!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created for a project at the University of Wisconsin Whitewater. The team was tasked to take an old game and add in a new mechanic so, why not add in guns? Oh and don't forget about explosions!\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Dylan Oelke - Programmer, Designer</p>\n<p>Lance Pearson - Programmer, Designer</p>\n<p>The art was mostly re purposed PNG's from the internet.
