However, I see in my dreams a paradise filled with carnal pleasures, pornography, and explicit sex.<br/>I need to find this place to recover my lost memory.\"<br/> - Excerpt from Lenny's diary -<br/><br/>A man needs to follow a trail in the desert that will lead him to the mythical and erotic Garden of Earthly Delights. He has lost his memory and the only reference to his past is in the mysterious stones he was carrying. He was found by Melody on the banks of a river completely naked, carrying only a bag of said stones. What is this legendary paradise that the stones reveal? What is his relationship with this paradise of carnal pleasures, watered with the most libidinous explicit sex?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This is the story of Lenny \"Nobody\", a man in search of answers about his past. He was found with no memory by a young recluse named Melody in the swamps. Lenny was naked and carrying a bag of runestones and valuable diamonds, which are the only clues he has to discover more about himself.<br/>After extensive research, he finally finds the answer in the Atacama Desert. The place hides a passage that leads to a world full of carnal pleasures, known as \"The Secret Garden of All Delights\". It is a true erotic paradise, full of nudity, pleasure, and explicit sex without shame.<br/>He discovers traces of a pagan temple within the desert, containing huge Germanic runes scattered among the stones and a cave mouth shaped like a vagina. Upon entering the cave, Lenny catches a glimpse of an incredible mythical world, filled with lots of sex and pornography.<br/>In this world, Lenny envisions hundreds of men and women engaging in explicit sexual acts in the middle of an enormous bucolic garden, an explosion of carnal and humid pleasures, a true paradise of the flesh.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This is a traditional visual novel with choice options buttons and mouse-click navigation.<br/>Click on the text or in the<strong> \"colored leaf\" </strong>to advance.
