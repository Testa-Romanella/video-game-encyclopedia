In order to appease your god, you must do damage control at his big bash and fix all of your party guests' problems. The attendees are a rambunctious group of goblins, orcs, elves and other mysterious magical creatures. It's up to you to make sure <em><strong>The Vibe</strong></em> of the party doesn't run out and shame your name. Your guests needs range from needing fresh drinks to pacifying a raging barbarian into a harmless balloon. Be on the lookout for the life of the party, Frog Wizard, to help you out when times get tough. Good luck and party on!</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Stephanie Hyson</strong> (https://hyson.itch.io/)</p><p>\u00a0- 3D Assets</p>\n<p><strong>Peter Forget</strong> (https://ratsinatrenchcoat.itch.io/)<br/></p><p>\u00a0- 2D Assets, UI Elements</p>\n<p><strong>Melaina Nelson</strong>\u00a0 (https://fuwanekogames.itch.io/)</p><p>\u00a0- Programming</p>\n<p><strong>Graham Squire</strong> (https://gsquire.itch.io/)</p><p>\u00a0- 2D Assets, Music</p>\n<p>In-game font: https://www.dafont.com/alagard.font\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10eea010917a8311d8bc03794768f72c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter Forget"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
