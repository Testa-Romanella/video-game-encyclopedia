{"id": 271794, "slug": "simplerpg", "name": "SimpleRPG", "name_original": "SimpleRPG", "description": "<p>*NOTE* Game is meant to be run in 1280x800 windowed mode</p>\n<p>This is VERY early, prototype phase. I'm still building the engine, many features are missing. This was initially made as a project for college, some of the features were rushed so I could turn it in and now I'm trying to move things more towards their final state.</p>\n<p>CURRENT BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>-Create character (Human Fighter)</p>\n<p>-Grab a quest from the tavern</p>\n<p>-Click Explore in the bottom left menu then explore on the middle to encounter enemies\u00a0(this is placeholder for now)</p>\n<p>-For combat, target an enemy and select an action to take, confirm the action to attack enemies. Still working on combat, there will soon be a 3 action economy per turn (with swift and free actions in addition) but this is still WIP.</p>\n<p>-Try to complete all 4 quests</p>\n<p>-Check the character tab at 2000 xp to level up, 5000 for level 3, ect</p>\n<p>-Rinse and repeat, try out different builds and items. Make sure to check the blacksmith, he might have something special.</p>\n\n<p>This game is a huge work in progress. I've got alot of ideas that I want to implement in the future, and I'm open to ideas and what you'd like to see.<br/></p>\n<p>As for now, the game will mostly play as a roguelike turn based 1 on 1 based around DnD and Pathfinder rules. I'm going to shape classes and races to fit my own needs and ideas, but for now it's very closely related to Pathfinder's rules. I'd recently playtested Pathfinder 2e, and I love their 3 action economy. I'm going to eventually do something similar to this since lack of movement can make combat feel stale.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The current goal is to get the game playable and to have the first adventure laid out so I can test the combat. After I've got the intro down, I'm going to try to add computer controlled party members you can come across during your adventures to recruit if you want them. Farther down the line, the idea is that you'll run a mercenary company inside of a town and eventually run the town.\u00a0The company/town management will run similarly to an idle game, unless that wont work out too well for the core gameplay.</p>\n<p>I'm honestly learning this as I go so there will be times I may have to rework sections of the game, or it may be very buggy/not work very efficiently. Some sections of the game may also come slowly because I'm trying to figure out the best way to implement them.</p>\n<p>Anyways, stay tuned for updates. A playable version is coming before too long.</p>\n<p>I'm accepting donations if you REALLY want to see this progress. I'm already going to work on this for a while regardless. But anything would go a long way ;)</p>\n<p>If you're interested in following, when I'm developing the game I usually post on a discord. It's going to be really slow going as I'm just one person. But you'll get updates, alerts, be able to vote in what you'd like to see next and watch me rage at bugs I come across.\u00a0https://discord.gg/DnqBkEr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PurpleFanta"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
