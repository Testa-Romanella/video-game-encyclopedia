Normally flamingos will filter their food and\u00a0gain their daily dose of Carotenoids in shallow waters where they wade.\u00a0However, these flamingos have eaten all the sources of food in the shallow\u00a0parts of the lake and because of this they are losing their pink colors.\u00a0Flamingos rely on their pink color as a symbol of dominance in their\u00a0flamboyance with the pinker flamingos on the top. The flamingos have\u00a0started to dive deeper waters to regain their color. This is their story.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Movement - Left Stick<br/>Neck - Right Stick<br/>Dash - Triggers</p>\n<ul><li>Eat krill and plants with your head\u00a0to gain Carotenoids</li><li>Dashing into other flamingos will cause them to drop some Carotenoids and be stunned for a short duration</li><li>Collect the most Carotenoids in 3 minutes to become the most dominant Flamingo</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Planned features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Close the game on quit</li><li>Play with only 2 or 3 players</li><li>Krillar.io</li><li>Strong Salmon</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/>Producer/Scrum Master - Kinsey Bowensmith<br/>Lead Programmer - Adam Clarke<br/>Lead Artist - Cameron Howell<br/>Lead Designer - Ryan Swanson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T03:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edf/edf9cbd78c4700c517e35631e88bad2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pink Lemonade"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
