The more the game goes, the better your fortress is, but the more aggressive are the monsters. The game is played at the 3th person. You can play alone or with your friends (several players on the same computer, or on Internet). The game is played exclusively with a keyboard or a joystick. Each game is unique (unique world, unique dungeons, unique monster patterns, unique technological recipe, etc.).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-05T13:18:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab043a20b6c3319c6f35bdc969bb3ffe.jpg", "website": "https://buildanddefend.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": [], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
