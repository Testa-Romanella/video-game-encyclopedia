I adore the background music since it fits the mood of the story I was attempting to develop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The story has multiple endings which are based on the choices you have made earlier on in the game and it has a little something on the side that you can do\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T06:06:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0db/0db1a036c82726dbc68000e1a3352158.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jazim-hammad"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
