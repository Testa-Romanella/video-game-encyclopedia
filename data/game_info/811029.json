You maybe even tried to play the board game! But now, you can play the video game of the board game of the video game!</p>\n<p>Basketball SLAM is everything you loved about NBA JAM slowed down and determined by nerdy shit like dice rolls!</p>\n<p>This is an offline turn-based local multiplayer game. It will start with randomly generated stats for each player displayed in the top left and the tipoff will happen immediately. Actions are in the top right. The general flow is Move, Action(Pass, Shoot, Steal), and then End Turn. It is completely mouse controlled, so just clicking the buttons and where to move will do it. Move+ and Shove cost a turbo.</p>\n<p>Each player has two turbos per scoring play. If a player is shoved, they cannot move on their next turn. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T08:39:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16b79143cc2fa4c04bc51c666ec5958f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["supercool117"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
