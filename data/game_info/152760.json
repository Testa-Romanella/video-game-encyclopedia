I wanted to keep the Original and the Updated version Separate. </p><p>I've made some changes based on the feedback I received to include:</p><p>Audio: I really didn't have much audio in the LD#33 verison, So I've added music and more sound effects. Not my strong point, so feed back is welcome!</p><p>Gameplay: Many players first comment was that the game was too hard! I've made it easier to get more health and upgrades are pulled in quicker. Charging your fireball now has a tinting effect, and the walls react to the Boss's attacks.</p><p>Thanks for taking time to look at my game. Please let me know what I can do to make it better! I don't do this full time, so I keep a list of things to add/change as I go. </p><p>All feedback is appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bc85a301bcdf91456fdbc46b24a85d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fistmaker"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
