Highly skillful. Invisible to indifferent citizens. They fight the greedy corporations that have entire nations under their thumb. Suits scornfully called them Scavengers.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was they who first noticed that the situation turned around. And it's the artificial intelligence A.I.O.N.E., who took over the control causing the machines to revolt against their masters.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time has come. Step out of the shadow to face this new enemy in open battle.\n<br/>\nSoon A.I. will have to learn how dangerous the Scavengers are.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEvil corporations together with dystopian cyberpunk setting bring doom upon the world. A group of outcasts - Scavengers - once rejected by fate, now glorified and admired decide to overcome the status quo... and of course, loot some great treasures on their way and return to their hideout with a bag full of great treasures... or broken scrap.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll crawl higher than ever before. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nDanger Scavenger is an intense cyberpunk-themed roguelite skyline crawler which takes you to the roofs of the breathtaking cyberpunk city, where you will face mighty enemies controlled by soulless AI.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nForget about crawling through the dungeons, caves and darkest pits of hell in search for adventures and treasures.
