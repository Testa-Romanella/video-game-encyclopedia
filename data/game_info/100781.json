{"id": 100781, "slug": "genesis-planet-kit", "name": "Genesis Planet Kit", "name_original": "Genesis Planet Kit", "description": "<p>Young Bobo is a space fanatic and in his suburban 1980's bedroom, he has managed to fully assemble his birthday present, A Glenn Chandler Genesis Planet Kit! Feeding ingredients into the machine should allow him the chance to create his own little world. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Based on the theme A Small World and heavily inspired by a short story I read when I was very young that has stayed with me my entire life. Bobo's Star by Glen Chandler.</p><p>Having finished this game and thought about it a lot, I am very proud of it and happy with the end product\u2026 but I don't think anyone is going to enjoy it as much as me. I made it very difficult to understand how to \"win\" and most people will see the fail condition and give up. Which is kinda exactly what I wanted because it fits with the subject material and inspiration. However, if anyone DOES stick with it and manage to make a planet, the reward, I hope, should feel like quite the achievement. Honestly, if you had to make a planet in a vacuum chamber, it WOULD be very difficult.</p><p>I am not expecting high scores for FUN on this one! But I stick by it and am really happy that I made it. I hope you at least are mildly amused by the game if you don't enjoy it. Thank you for playing!</p><p>Mouse and Click Controls</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdc1a8ad86e4dc04c0ad86b70e181b6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xopsx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
