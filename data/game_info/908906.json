If you run out of energy, it's game over for Grim.</p>\n<p>If you last one minute you'll be taken to your garden to see your newly planted souls. (I did have a whole plan for different ends depending on ratio of souls harvested etc but yknow, jam-time... so for now it's just a breakdown of harvested stats)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:57:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72fcb3931be84b792f9112f0ccbc1abd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gossian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
