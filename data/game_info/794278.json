You're determined. You're well equipped for the job. What job, you may ask? Well, isn't it obvious? You've taken it upon yourself to be the hero your local park needs. You've shouldered a personal and intimate responsibility to this location's wildlife. You are no more and no less than a mallard messiah in your jurisdiction. You. Will. Feed. The. Ducks.\r\n</p>\n<p>Or not. You could also just explore around a small park area if you desire. It's ultimately up to you!\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is my entry to the May 2022 Bitsy Jam, whose theme this month was \"Duck.\"\u00a0 I wasn't initially going to participate in this month\u2019s bitsy jam, but it's been one of those weeks that I felt like I needed something small and lighthearted to work on. It's a short little experience with only 9 screens total and 10 ducks to feed within them. I hope you find it goofy and whimsical, but no matter what you think, thank you very much for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T09:52:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d4a6642ed228133fa77f9789e8dee76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
