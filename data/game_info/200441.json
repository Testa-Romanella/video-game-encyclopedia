Still, you must persevere and take down this large foe. Be careful when attacking the giant too much, as he will get angry and turn a deep shade of red (as giants do). When he is angry, he will pace relentlessly around the room trying to find you and he'll put his back into every swing of his Greatsword of Puny Person Punishing +4.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made for The Big Festive Game Jam by Game Dev Network with the theme of Surprise. It's kind of surprising: you surprise the giant by doing x5 damage if he's unaware of you, and he surprises you by clobbering you from the dark for half your health. Surprise! I've been playing Dark Souls 2 for about the past month so some of those concepts sneaked their way into this game. The text for the game I modeled after the text from the game Crawl (admittedly, not quite as well).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The field of view for the character uses a stencil shader.
