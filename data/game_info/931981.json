Now you a mage freedom\u00a0fighter must reclaim your land and defeat him. Fortunately using magic and power you can bring back the spirits\u00a0of those who once were to overthrow the Ogre Lord's dark towers.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are playing on a Windows machine using the Windows version of the game, once launched maximise the window.

At the\u00a0start of the game you will have 50MP. Magic power can be collected by finding potions or defeating snakeworms which\u00a0drop potions on death. When you have MP you can cast a powerful projectile spell, if you have no MP you can only\u00a0punch which requires you to get closer to enemies. Magic projectiles do 3 points of damage, whilst punching only\u00a0does 1 point of damage.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You can boost your health by finding Hearts scattered across the battlefield. Hearts can also be gathered by defeating\u00a0dragons. Hearts add 30HP.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The UI displays F and K on the left hand side of the screen. F means Followers, it displays the amount of active\u00a0followers you have in your party. K means Keys, keys are required to unlock jail doors.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you lose any followers press X and it will display a compass at the bottom right corner pointing you in the\u00a0general direction to one of your active followers. Sometimes they will require a little push, other times they\u00a0might find their own way to the castle.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Enemy Information:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wormsnake</strong></p>\n\n<p>Drops Magic Potion</p>\n<p>HP: 5</p>\n<p>Does 1 point of damage</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barbarian</strong></p>\n\n<p>HP: 10</p>\n<p>Does 2 point of damage</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dragon</strong></p>\n\n<p>Drops Heart</p>\n<p>HP: 20</p>\n<p>Does 5 point of damage</p>\n\n<p><em>If you have any questions, have any bugs to report or anything feel free to get in touch.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T13:40:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee8/ee89d52c3889822081f34e2ef2daa60e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Dungeon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
