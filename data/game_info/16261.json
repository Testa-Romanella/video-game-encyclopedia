However, she has a<strong> history of poor class attendance</strong>, and has repeatedly failed her latest classes. <br/>This year, she made a <strong>deal with her parents</strong>: she\u2019d either graduate, or they\u2019d change towns. Unfortunately, the masked fighting tournament also takes place for the first time in the very town Red lives in... making it her <strong>one and only chance</strong> to make her dream come true! <br/><br/>Thankfully, <strong>that\u2019s where you come in</strong>!<br/><br/>With your guidance, she needs to <strong>balance</strong> her studies with her training so she can bring home both the champion's belt, and her graduation.  <br/><br/>The game is a <strong>life-management simulation</strong>, presented as a <strong>visual novel</strong>, with<strong> beat'em-up elements</strong>.<br/><strong>In short: some reading, a little fighting... and lots of planning!</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>    A visual novel based around choice and reactivity! See how events unfold based on your decisions... or lack of commitment!<br/></li><li>    A sizeable cast of characters to encounter in dynamic events, with individual subplots to pursue!<br/></li><li>    Fight for your dreams in the ring, or to get back your suit from dastardly thugs in the street!<br/></li><li>    Plan ahead to make the most of the 6 months you have left until graduation!<br/></li><li>    Bring home the champion's belt if you can, but make sure to ace your tests as well! Can you really do both?</li></ul><br/><br/><strong>Pricing</strong><br/><br/>The game uses a <strong>\"pay-what-you-liked\"</strong> remuneration model.<br/><br/>\"Pay-what-you-liked\" is a system designed after \"pay-what-you-want\", except <strong>you choose to support the game *after* having played it for yourself</strong>, and determined its personal value based on your own experience. It is designed to<strong> offer each player the most choice possible in how, when and why when considering whether to support the game or not</strong>.<br/><br/>Since Steam doesn't support \"pay-what-you-liked\" or \"pay-what-you-want\" remuneration systems,<strong> the DLC acts as a stand-in to offer multiple suggested tiers of support</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: <strong>buying DLC stands in for supporting the game at the value of the suggested tier. It will NOT enhance or change your ingame experience, you will not be getting additional content other players can't access</strong>, as the aim for this system is for the game to be the same for everyone: ie, its most complete state right off the bat! That also means the game is NOT F2P/P2W: there is NO in-game economy that allows you to pay for additional content. The game is fully available for free from the minute you start playing it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/979988e73ca4dbd7a69a136d53782236.jpg", "website": "http://pehesse.fr/honey/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 164, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 37, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pehesse"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Self"], "esrb_rating": null}
