In this world, all the characters that appear are just a \"silhouette\" of reality. The silhouette is just a trace left by the noumenon in this time and space. We don't know how they really are now. But we can catch a glimpse of their stories through these memories of the world fixed in the letter. Among the many unconscious silhouettes, a special silhouette was born. He began to wander in the letter, watching others' stories and looking for his own part of self. Each level represents a letter sent or not sent, representing a memory. Players will extract key word information through the content of the \"letter\", and then the images contained in the words will be embodied into related capabilities.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>WASD for movement</p>\n<p>SPACE for jump</p>\n<p>Mouse\u00a0 for \u00a0shadow controlling</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T07:11:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/150/15052c501777a9f3b3eaee026ed4facb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["artilor901z"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
