Be warned, this is very prototypey. I had limited time to slap together, and kept the UI ugly to focus on having an end of game feature.</p>\n<p>I will return to this prototype in a few weeks and update the UI and narrative. Note that there's an error when you return to the main menu, the cursor may not appear. If not, you can press escape to quit (ran out of time to fix that bug).</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little exploration experience.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Bec K - Game Developer</p>\n<p>Made in Unity</p>\n<p>3D Models: Synty Studios\r\n</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://store.johnleonardfrench.com/l/Gqks\u00a0</p>\n<p>Middleware: Fungus and Unity's\u00a0Starter Assets Pack</p>\n<p>Header and banner art made using MidJourney</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:07:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7d/f7d175a58361197e32d80ddd551ad2a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unnatural Freaks Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
