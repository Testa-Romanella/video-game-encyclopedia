Your goal is simple: create combinations equaling 10 by sliding numbers around the playing field. Move them horizontally or vertically, but be careful not to create an unusable non-number in the process. Choose from one of three modes: eliminate a set amount of numbers as quickly as possible in ZEROSUM MODE, get rid of prearranged groups of numbers in as few moves as possible in PUZZLE MODE, or continue removing numbers until your game is over in INFINITE MODE. In addition, you can challenge an opponent to a two-player wireless battle in VS MODE and see whose number-crunching skills reign supreme. If you think you\u2019re a master with numbers, the straightforward yet challenging world of Art Style: BASE 10 gives you the opportunity to prove it in a unique way.</p>\n<p>Check out more Art Style games!</p>\n<p>For WiiWare:<br />\nArt Style: CUBELLO<br />\nArt Style: light trax<br />\nArt Style: ORBIENT<br />\nArt Style: ROTOHEX<br />\nArt Style: Rotozoa</p>\n<p>For DSiWare:<br />\nArt Style: AQUIA<br />\nArt Style: BOXLIFE<br />\nArt Style: DIGIDRIVE<br />\nArt Style: precipice<br />\nArt Style: Zengage<br />\nArt Style: PiCTOBiTS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T19:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/214244246ec66dc4ec5af091c6e10cc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS", "Nintendo DSi"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
