The goal of the project was that each\u00a0writer would write\u00a0a piece of interactive narrative telling the story of one character.</p>\n<p>During the jam we managed to create a game with two stories but as the original goal was to have many stories by different writers, we are sill welcoming new writers to take part and add their story to this growing collaborative narrative. If you're interested in writing a story for the project, please contact me in Discord (Miro Aurela#9803).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T13:58:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ca/6ca7e205aae4207b2131609c307e7d5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lrdazrl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
