The original concept was an infinite platformer, however during Ludum Dare we were not able to achieve the random generation required to make the game infinite, so instead we opted for a fixed map and a hidden time attack element to add some replayibility. Following Ludum Dare, we plan to add this random generation element, which will shift the goal from fastest completion to furthest distance traveled.</p><p>The programming was mostly vel0h, while the level design and art was mostly Bloxri.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce8/ce8914aaa279ba007f886d789bec7dea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vel0h"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
