Can you investigate what is happening here? Can you get to know each passenger well enough to write your book and maybe even... for something more?</p>\n<p>Game available on english and russian.</p>\n<p>I hope you can find out the \"real\" ending, because it's not as easy as you think.</p>\n<p>If you find errors or bugs - just let me know and I will try to fix them as soon as I can.<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T13:56:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efde1c654292b809007aa23dba7f10c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["C-14"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
