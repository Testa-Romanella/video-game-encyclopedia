Reality, in this universe at least, is a sentient being that desperately wishes to split into multiple timelines. But in order to split, it awaits a significant event to occur, one that will be human-centered. Hence, it provokes the passerbys using its own, incomprehensible language, to change what they are currently up to, and do something more vibrant, such as dance, sing, fill it with color, or simply smile. Whenever a wanderer makes a significant change, a new layer is created, and starts blending with Reality. Each event that triggers a timeline split is displayed, ultimately forming a grid of Reality snippets that are overlayed on Reality itself, in terms of visual and auditory elements.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>programming :\u00a0Vassiliios Karavassiles\u00a0</p>\n<p>art direction / sound design\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0:\u00a0Christina Chrysanthopoulou</p><p>Special thanks to Konstantinos Mourelas\u00a0</p>\n<p>Glitch effect credited to\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/keijiro/KinoGlitch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T07:19:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/368/3683748966c400136447ccd481bd29a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eNViRA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
