Graphics, sounds, features, etc. may change and probably will! Since most of the art is 'programmer art' for the time being, the game may not look all that great, but I'm working with some artists to help bring the game to life!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In this game, you play with others online in an arena to prove who is the best pilot. Fly your ship while completing the objective and taking out your opponent.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are several game modes available during Early Release with more being added all the time as well as an ever expanding map pool.\r\n</p>\n<p>We offer the ability for you to connect to one of our official servers with the ability to host your own coming\u00a0in the future!\r\n</p>\n<p>We also offer a map editor which allows you to create maps and share them with the rest of the community! If you think the maps you design are some of the best we highly recommend submitting them to be reviewed for the In-Rotation map pool!\r\n</p>\n<p>Single player is also another game mode that is in development. The direction that is desired for that game mode has yet to be determined, but if you would like to help shape it, hop into our discord and give your feedback and suggestions!\r\n</p>\n\r\nGame Account\r\n<p>We do offer the ability to create an account to secure your display name, however, it's not required to play! Just download the game and give it a shot as a guest!\r\n</p>\n<strong>Discord</strong>\n<p>If you want to keep up with the latest developments on the project, feel free to join the Discord server to chat with myself and other pilots. Share maps, ideas, strategy or just chat about the game!\r\n</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/WskxjVEUBr\r\n</p>\r\nFAQ\r\nHow much does the game cost?\r\n<p>Nothing! It's completely free to play!\r\n</p>\r\nI found a bug!\r\n<p>If you find a bug in game, hop into our discord and report it in the #bug-reports channel so it can be addressed as quickly as possible!\r\n</p>\r\nWhat does signing up for an account get me?\r\n<p>Right now, the features offered for account holders is limited. We do have plans as development continues to add a leaderboard with top kills, score points, etc as well as some other features. For now, it's mostly used to reserve your Display Name. If you sign up during the development phase, you'll get a special badge based on what phase you signed up in!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T09:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc2/dc29cbeb353a3591cc1a7d6bc5c044b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TA418"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
