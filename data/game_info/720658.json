Since I put a lot of work and time into this game I didn't want to just let this game sit in my computer. I made this game alone with a help of my brother who made 3D assets. It is a little shorter but fun none the less :)\u00a0The game is for free but if you enjoyed it I would be very thankful for any donation because I am currently working on another bigger game and it would be nice to have some budget :D But just the fact that you would play it makes me happy.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that you will enjoy it :)\u00a0)</p>\n<p><strong>Titanic - The Unsinkable Ship is a first-person game, that lets you choose between two unique characters and experience, what it feels like to be on a sinking ship.
