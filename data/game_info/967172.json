Over the last few decades the Senate has become corrupt and has progressively lost power and influence, while the Emperor Diocletian and his army ruled unchallenged outside the eternal city.<br/><br/>Seeking to return to a dominant position, the members of the Roman Senate decide to use necromancy to increase their power, creating an army of undead and demons to fight against imperial soldiers.<br/><br/>By waging war on its own emperor, the Senate has caused a rift in the Roman population, which slowly began to live in fear.<br/><br/>Year after year the armies of undead summoned by the Senate have taken over, imposing themselves on the senators and enslaving the Roman population.<br/><br/>In this climate of chaos, an ancient gladiatorial school continued to train soldiers for the games. But the purpose of these gladiators is now different: to rid the city of the undead and invaders...to allow Rome to return to its former glory.<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><br/><strong>Ludus Mortis</strong> is a Grid-Based First Person Dungeon Crawler inspired by classic cRPG from the 80s and 90s.<br/>It's a party-based RPG (\"blobber\") with turn-based combat.<br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br/><ul><li>Create your characters choosing from 14 classes<br/></li><li>Manage and develop you Ludus (Gladiator School) by improving facilities, acquiring gladiators, crafting new equipment.<br/></li><li>Explore catacombs and dungeons.<br/></li><li>Manage your party changing formation, equipment and skills: you can try different combinations for every different dungeon.<br/></li><li>Turn-based combat: think carefully and use your Action Points wisely.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T05:33:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5aa/5aa7133383337da0d1cc31768fb421d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["68k Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["68k Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
