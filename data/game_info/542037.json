This game was made in three hours, using the Unity engine, Aseprite, Ecrett music, and Bleeper.<br/><br/>This game was really fun to make, and the limit of three hours really made me plan out things so that I had enough time to finish and polish my game. Overall I like this jam concept, and I'm thinking of participating again :)<br/><br/>Side note: I disabled post-processing on the WebGL build, so if you want a prettier experience, you might want to download the desktop version ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T05:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/67705b4dee00d3a24dcbf93d2b6dd0af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Geek_Joystick"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
