To play it on PC you'll need an emulator such as Stella.<br/></p>\n<p>DigiBeatz is a rhythm game for the Atari 2600 that features  software-generated sound to split the console's 2 audio channels into 5.  It contains 7 originally composed tracks, each with 5 charts of varying  difficulty. All this in only 4 kilobytes.<br/></p>\n<p> After selecting a chart, notes will begin falling from the top of the  screen towards the targets at the bottom. Before the note reaches the  target, position the joystick so the corresponding target is highlighted  - left, right or center. Then press fire right when the note overlaps  the target. If the note is hit successfully, a color will flash at the  bottom indicating how well the note was timed. Green means perfect  timing: +100 points, +1 health. Yellow means good timing: 50 points, +1  health. Red means poor timing: 20 points, -2 health. If your health  flashes red, it means the note was missed: 0 points, -4 health. If your  health reaches 0, it's game over.   \u00a0  </p>\n<p> Setting the Player 1 difficulty switch to A increases the tempo of all songs.  </p>\n<p> Setting the Player 2 difficulty switch to A changes the game to work  with the Track and Field controller. When a note reaches the targets,  the corresponding button on the controller should be pressed. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T01:27:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15f/15f0e34604fc57308144d99920092e56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mystical Wheelbarrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
