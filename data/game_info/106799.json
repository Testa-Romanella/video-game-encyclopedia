I had super mario and legend of zelda 2 in mind while working on this. It's a simple action side scroller. \u00a0Buuuuut it's work in progress. (all the stuff is made by me) So it takes a long time. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <strong>It is still a DEMO but eventually I'll have it finished.</strong></p>\n<p>There's no music yet only because I don't want the file to be big.</p>\n<p><strong>-Gameplay-</strong> \u00a0 Use arrow keys to move<strong> left</strong> and <strong>right</strong>, <strong>UP</strong> arrow to jump, <strong>Space</strong> to shoot (hold <strong>space</strong> for super shot), <strong>Shift</strong> to use items, <strong>Enter</strong> to pause, <strong>Backspace</strong> to exit level, hold <strong>DOWN</strong> while attacking to attack low,\u00a0 and '<strong>S</strong>' to save game (I'm going to make a proper save/load screen soon). You can load saves (or save as of now) at the main menu.</p>\n<p>So yeh this is a new game project I started 2 months ago and I'm now uploading a playable demo.
