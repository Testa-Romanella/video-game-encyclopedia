I used two different player controllers to create a different platformer so one fish goes up and down the other left and right.</p>\n<p>StuckTogether is a game about two fish that suffer from our negligence as a species as we throw more and more rubbish into our seas and oceans. Can you help them get separated and escape their perils?</p>\n<p>I wanted to make a cute little game but also have a message following my last project that I\u00a0completed in college.</p>\n<p>So I\u00a0hope you enjoy it and let me know your thoughts! I\u00a0am sure I have 1000 bugs or more but I had fun making it!</p>\n<p>WASD - are the controls or arrows!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:04:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b397a33e69bbd931f94bd75f3a9955b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noel Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
