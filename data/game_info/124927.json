When I started the challenge, I was coming back from my Kendo course, so I had the idea to do my game in a Dojo.<br/></p><p>My goal here as a programmer, was to learn how to modelize, rig, and animate a 3D character, so that I can work better with 3D artists. It take me a long time to achieve this poor result, but it's functionnal and I learned a lot.</p><p>I didn't have time to implement all the gameplay elements. I wanted to add the space bar key to allow more complicated combos. Moreover I wanted to add a notion of tempo, so that combinations of keys have to be pressed in a right order, and in a right time. I wanted the player to have an avatar that blocks the attacks with a bokken, and that the characters move in the room at each attack.</p><p>Please, enjoy testing this game, and don't hesitate to let me a comment !</p><p>NB : The web version isn't stable, if you have trouble with it, download the version for your OS.<br/></p><p>PS : I pickup on internet the background image, the font, and the audio<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a23/a2322107d8644e34d86ccb6372c3337f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Darenn Keller"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
