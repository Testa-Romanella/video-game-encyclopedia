HK416s... Colt 1911s... you name it!\u00a0 You could easily defend yourself with these!</p>\n<p>However, you find the very notion of lugging around these militaristic weapons of mass destruction to be quite\u00a0silly.\u00a0 You are just a simple, elderly engineer!\u00a0 What do you know about all this\u00a0killing, and all this\u00a0close range combat?\u00a0 So you opt to put your engineering skills to the test and you mock-up a gun that will allow you to control the bullets after they leave the chamber, essentially turning them into missiles.\u00a0 This will help with your inexperience and lousy aim!\u00a0 However, after taking control of the bullets they will detonate after a little more than a second, so you can't exactly stay in a safe spot and let the bullets do all the work for you either.\u00a0 In other words, you will still have to get close enough to the enemies if you want the missiles to damage them in time before they detonate.\u00a0\u00a0Your goal is to leave the planet on an alien spacecraft.\u00a0 Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls/Rules</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use WASD to move, space to jump, shift to fire, and the arrow keys to control the bullets.\u00a0 And as always Alt+Enter to toggle Fullscreen!\u00a0\u00a0You cannot fire more than two bullets at a time.\u00a0\u00a0When the light on the gun is green instead of red, it means you have hit the arrow keys, thus activating the bullets' missile mode and taking control.\u00a0 During this time you will not be able to shoot anymore and must wait for the current bullets to detonate.\u00a0 The end of each room is blocked off by a door which you will need to open by shooting a button.\u00a0 You will need to hit the button with a bullet when it is in \"missile\" mode, then it will turn green to indicate it has been activated.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Information</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Created for the Amaze Me Game Jam, with the theme \"NEON.\"</p>\n<p>This was the first game I \"completed!\"\u00a0 I say \"completed\" in quotation marks because\u00a0 there was a lot more I wanted to add to it like sound effects or even a menu screen but I had to prioritize what I chose to program in due to time constraints.\u00a0 As a result the game just sort of... starts.\u00a0 \u00a0I may add these features in once the jam is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:00:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad9/ad9c208b4940d233875ffb8878d3c6fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AtomicNarration"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
