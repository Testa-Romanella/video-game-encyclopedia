Her name was Haruka Takamori.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat night, Takamaru and Narika were attacked by a<br/>\nmysterious group of ninjas. The one who saved them from the<br/>\ncrisis was none other than Haruka, wearing kunoichi gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaruka called Takamaru her master and asked him to perform<br/>\nsexual acts with her. It turned out that Takamaru was the<br/>\nyoung master of a heroic ninja clan known as the Crescent<br/>\nMoons, and via sex, he had the ability to provide a<br/>\nsupernatural energy called Sex Power (SP).<br/>\n<br/>\nHaruka obtained some SP from Takamaru and managed to fight<br/>\noff the ninjas, but that was only the beginning of a long<br/>\nand arduous battle.<br/>\n\u00a0\nCharacters:\n<br/>\nThe Crescent Moons:<br/>\nFormally known as the Souha Crescent Moons, they're a ninja<br/>\nclan founded by the first Dragonian and a kunoichi. Their<br/>\nextraordinary combat ability permitted them not to have to<br/>\nwork under a particular lord, but to follow the master of<br/>\nthe clan's judgment in who would be best to assist at any<br/>\ngiven time. Highly active behind the scenes throughout<br/>\nJapan's history, they once drove a monster known as Noroi<br/>\ninto a corner, but he managed to escape into the future.<br/>\nWith the objective of vanquishing Noroi before he could<br/>\nreturn to his full power in the era where he would once<br/>\nagain appear, the Crescent Moons continued to fight to<br/>\nprotect their master as they honed their combative and<br/>\norganizational abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHaruka Takamori:<br/>\nA Blade, the title given to the Crescent Moons' strongest<br/>\nkunoichis, who chased after Noroi from the past into the<br/>\nfuture. For Takamaru's protection, and to study the current<br/>\nworld herself, she began to attend Jippou Academy. Most of<br/>\nthe time, she's just a normal girl observing modern society<br/>\nand trying to fit in. Despite being in the same year of<br/>\nschool as Takamaru, she's actually older than he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer talent is so great that she achieved the rank of Blade<br/>\nfar faster than most, but she could never bring herself to<br/>\ncross the line of giving her past master her chastity,<br/>\nleaving her not truly a Blade at the time she arrived in<br/>\nthe modern age.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile normally a kind, warm, big-hearted girl, she becomes<br/>\nan elegant warrior in battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNarika Shihoudou:<br/>\nA girl three years younger than Takamaru, and the daughter<br/>\nof his landlord and the head of the dojo he attends, Seigen<br/>\nShihoudou. Actually a member of the Crescent Moons, she<br/>\ndidn't initially participate in combat, but certain<br/>\ncircumstances led to her becoming a Blade and throwing<br/>\nherself into a life of sex and fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough well practiced in martial arts, her personality is<br/>\nthat of a normal girl, and she particularly loves anything<br/>\nsweet. She's hit on around town frequently enough to be<br/>\naware of how cute she is, but still has feelings of<br/>\ninferiority when put next to Haruka's body and personality.<br/>\nAlbeit cold at times, she's a caring girl at heart and has<br/>\npositive feelings for Takamaru.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTakamaru Ikusabe:<br/>\nThe protagonist of this story. By way of a ritual called<br/>\nDragon Synergy (which is essentially sex), he can give his<br/>\nsexual partners a supernatural energy called Sex Power.<br/>\nAlthough not initially aware of it himself, he's lined up<br/>\nto become the 23rd master of the ninja clan known as the<br/>\nCrescent Moons, and fated to fight Noroi. Upon Haruka's<br/>\nappearance, he was determined, if not bewildered by the<br/>\nrevelations, to fight the Noroi Faction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAkira Kurogane:<br/>\nThe school nurse at Jippou Academy. Holds an unlit<br/>\ncigarette in her mouth at all times. Familiarly referred to<br/>\nas Ms. Akira by the students, she gives them, including<br/>\nTakamaru, advice for both their public and private affairs.<br/>\nIt turns out that she's a member of the Crescent Moons, and<br/>\neffectively the acting commander in the fight with the<br/>\nNoroi Faction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSubaru:<br/>\nA Blade of the Crescent Moons, as well as Haruka's close<br/>\nfriend and senior kunoichi. During the effort to stop the<br/>\nNoroi Faction from traveling to the future, she lost to one<br/>\nof their leaders, Ittou Hagane, after which she was<br/>\nimprisoned in Castle Infinity.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The following two are less important)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeigen Shihoudou:<br/>\nNarika's father, as well as Takamaru's landlord and martial<br/>\narts instructor. He's a calm, stern man.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzumori:<br/>\nThe Crescent Moons' operator. He's a hard-working,<br/>\nsubmissive boy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNoroi:<br/>\nA mysterious being worshipped by Ensai and the Noroi<br/>\nFaction as the Lord of Salvation. He feeds on the grief,<br/>\nfear, and sorrow of mankind, and provides the Noroi Faction<br/>\nwith supernatural power such that they can better produce<br/>\nit. Once put on the brink of death by the Crescent Moons,<br/>\nhe fled to the modern era, where there was a high<br/>\npopulation, but few who could oppose him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Noroi Faction is a combat group founded by Ensai<br/>\nMukuroi that fights for \"True Eternity\", an ideal in which<br/>\nthey use Noroi's power to destroy human civilization and<br/>\ncreate a world of everlasting peace through fear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEnsai Mukuroi:<br/>\nOne of the Tetra Sealers, the four leaders of the Noroi<br/>\nFaction, as well as its founder.

When Haruka and<br/>\nSubaru tried to stop the time leap in the past, he severed<br/>\none of Subaru's arms, displayed his overwhelming<br/>\nsuperiority. His chosen name itself means \"Sword\", as he<br/>\nsees himself as the sword cleaving its way to his ideals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKikyou-dayu:<br/>\nThe Tetra Sealer known as the Red Guardian.<br/>\nUnlike the other Tetra Sealers, she's driven purely by ego,<br/>\nand her self-obsession itself gives her great power.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOrochimaru:<br/>\nThe Tetra Sealer known as the Blue Guardian.<br/>\nThe newest member of the Tetra Sealers, he strongly opposes<br/>\nanyone who claims to fight for justice and sees the Blades<br/>\nas his rivals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(The following are all less important)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Demonic Judge - Ichizen Gouoka<br/>\nA Kainin who captures those who break his personally set<br/>\nlaws and lays down personally determined punishments he<br/>\ncalls the Judgment of Gouoka.

She hates anyone who commits crimes<br/>\n(especially sexual harassment) and charges them with severe<br/>\npunishments.

An egomaniac, he'll do anything to find<br/>\nthe truth he seeks, no matter who has to be sacrificed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Demonic Princess - Almer<br/>\nA magical girl Kainin. She looks and acts like she's<br/>\nspacing out half the time. Full of curiosity, she'll do<br/>\nthings like make a merry-go-round out of people's cars for<br/>\nfun, unaware of the danger she's causing. And having her<br/>\nfun interrupted only makes her angry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Phantasmic Fungus - Takemura-doujin<br/>\nA mushroom turned into a Kainin with a laid back manner of<br/>\nspeaking.
