It is an adventure and rpg game in an open world. A vast and colorful place where you must explore each nook and cranny to understand it and know its mysteries. Their stories and their legends. There are hundreds of objects to gather. From jars to plants, going through all kinds of minerals and ingredients of animals, creatures and beasts, a variety of tools and weapons such as swords and various types of spears and shields with which to protect yourself from the danger that always appears when you least expect it. Without forgetting those magical and fantastic objects with which we will meet and that also will intrigue us.</p>\n\n\n<p>We can move by water with the help of different types of rowboats and sails. Which can be improved with sails and different types of oars, witch will not only help us navigate faster through the waters, but also to escape the dangers that the depths contain. By land we can travel long distances in seconds thanks to the Magic Portals that apparently the disappeared Strange Civilization built millennia ago. We can make potions of all kinds and power. Also manipulate minerals to transform them and that could be useful in any adventure or work. And repair tools, weapons and build structures of all kinds and complexity. The chests and their mysteries will not be a chore if you have a lockpick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Skill Tree will show us everything we already know and how much we still lack. Let's not forget that Albius is a fifteen-year-old boy and a simple apprentice. A complete Inventory will let us keep track of the objects we have and know their characteristics and uses. A Quest Journal will allow us to understand what remains to be done and what adventure to continue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Life surrounds each stone and we will have to understand it and know it through books to see what advantage we can obtain from them. And maybe in other times we will only have to fight it without mercy.<br/>Books are an inexhaustible source of knowledge in the world of EONIA and there are dozens of them. They will tell us the forgotten story. They will tell us about the present and, why not, they will show us a glimpse of the future. And just like that, and maybe with a little luck, we can solve all the mysteries of EONIA.
