Arif's Adventure covers all aspects of a platformer game where the game mechanics like player movements, collectables, basic combat, hazards like spikes and enemies are involved. Arif's Adventure is a seamless game, where you see transitions between levels, scene structure, sound effects, main menu, pause menu, options menu and other UI elements. I add finishing touches like camera shake, basic shaders, particle effects, and UI animations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal of Arif's Adventure is to make an empty project and turn it into a small, complete game. In doing so, I used many aspects of Godot engine from input handling, to tilemaps, to particles, to audio, and more. By the time I completed Arif's Adventure, I felt more comfortable working on it and I walked away with a solid foundational understanding of making games that are not only functional but also fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arif's Adventure helped me gained more game development knowledge especially with Godot Engine as I hardly use this engine to make games; gained more programming knowledge with Python and potentially want to make more Python games in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>TIP: It tells you how to play the game\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T07:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2d/f2dd82b67fa53f9eaf7f394c15c475fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
