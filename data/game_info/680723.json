This was a lot of fun to do, and really taught us a lot about the importance of audio in a game.<br/></p>\n<p>The optional theme of this game jam was ON THE EDGE, and we took that as being ON THE EDGE OF LIFE, in this game you are in constant danger of being flattened and have to balance safety, the timer, and your health. <br/><br/>We had a lot of fun working on this, as we learned a lot about FMOD and audio integration in unity games. There's a lot more we wished to add, such as dash movement, tutorial, more levels, better visuals,\u00a0 but time absolutely melted away.<br/></p>\n<p>The theme was built around Yui Hatori, our friend and Vtuber!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/><strong>Assets used:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fantasy Skybox by RenderKnight</li><li>Kenney's Particle Pack</li><li>Low Poly City Pack by Broken Vector<br/>\n</li><li>ShaderGraphs Mtoon by simplestar-game</li><li>UniVRM by VRM Consortium</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>\n<p>Maxwell Lovell - https://twitter.com/maxwell_lovell</p>\n<p><strong>Composer<br/></strong></p>\n<p>_nownoir - https://twitter.com/_nownoir<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Avatar Model / Voice / YUI\u00a0 HERSELF<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Yui Hatori - https://yuihatori.carrd.co/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/6777684d9e4b65daca87236941c69657.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["maxwell_grimm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
