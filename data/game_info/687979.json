Mysterious creatures and entities are lurking around us wherever we go, and our job is to know who or what they are, why they are here, and what we can do to help them. If they pose a threat to our kind, our highly-trained professionals will neutralize the subject and will secure them in one of our remote, maximum security locations across the nation. We can assure that wherever there is a threat to humanity, we will be the first ones to answer the call.</p>\n<p>If you encounter any strange phenomena in your area, please contact us below:</p>\n<p>Anomaly Hotline: <strong>1-800-[XXX]-[XXXX]</strong></p>\n<p>Our website: <strong>[WEBSITE UNAVAILABLE]</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-15T11:59:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/685/685d956a12b8d571ecb2f2ec762f58fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AploveStudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
