It was created over a two day period for Ludum Dare 29. It was also a way to experiment with a couple of ideas I'm using in The Hit.</p><p>It's not a long game, and it's rather vague in its objectives, but it does have a win state. I hope you enjoy it.</p><p><strong>Updated 19 August 2015 (Windows only)</strong></p><p>This version has some extra effects, just a few things I'm prototyping for The Hit.<br/></p>Dan", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c1/4c114463aae172ea9c7ebcb33e47033c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dan Stubbs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
