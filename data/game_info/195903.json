This is a very early build of the game so expect problems.</p>\n<p>Differences of web vs native versions:</p>\n<ul><li>City states do not spawn in the web version. This is due to them needing multithreading which does not work in the web version.</li><li>Middle mouse will not move the camera in the web version. This is due to middle mouse activating the scroll thing in the browser so it is disabled for now.</li><li>Performance will not be as good in the web version. Also there will be more input lag. This is extremely noticeable on less powerful devices although my gaming PC can still play it fairly smoothly.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/341/341ce5853bb2f6a589dbc34a0bec37f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["impure"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
