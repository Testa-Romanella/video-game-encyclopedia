After Yuan Shao agreed to the request of the envoy to Jingzhou, Liu Bei joined Guan Yu and others, and immediately left Hebei and came to Jingzhou! Because Liu Biao refused to go out and Yuan Shao was stubborn, Cao Cao finally defeated Yuan Shao, the prince with the most troops in the world!<br/><h3>Chapter 3 Story of Jingzhou</h3>After Liu Bei arrived in Jingzhou, although Liu Biao did not accept the proposal to form an alliance with Yuan Shao to fight against Cao Cao, Liu Biao was very kind to Liu Bei, and Liu Biao sent Xinye City to Liu Bei to let him garrison.
