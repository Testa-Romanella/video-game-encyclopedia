An assassin is tasked with the \u201cspring cleaning\u201d.\r\n  </p>\n<p>In this game you play as the assassin. The more you kill, the bigger your rank will be. With the rank comes the powers. Enjoy haste (move very quick), invisibility (only if you stay still) and shield (protect you from taking damage). Waiting being invisible and combining haste with shield will allow you to wipe out any formation of enemies.\r\n  </p>\n<p>In this game you can enjoy physics, AI driven NPCs, various interactions and hiding places (bushes) and powerful skills that can wreak havoc on the enemies. Using the skills together will allow you to wipe out an entire army.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game has been made in December 2019 (+-) for a University coursework. The version presented here at this moment is the same version that was submitted. I am aware of some bugs and when the time will allow me, I will patch then all. However, this game will receive new content (more skills, weapons, missions, maps) in a not too far future, so bear with me.   </p>\n<p>Enjoy the game Full-Screen, with volume ON and have fun with kills that you can almost feel!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Tip: The \u201cescape hole\u201d appears after you kill the target. If you cannot see it, press \u201cQ\u201d to toggle UI elements on/off. (this tip is also available in-game).\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:34:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecf246726f627e54b638b95e1843971f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Florin Pain"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
