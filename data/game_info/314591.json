You pay in permanent loss of health the precious upgrades to your stats and your shiny new weapons.</p>\n<p>The cycle of the game is simple: it begins a new wave, throws you in it, and it doesn\u2019t end until you\u2019ve cleaned up the generated room of all the slimes. Then, you\u2019ll be able to activate the Upgrade Console (by pressing F near it), and to trigger the next room generation (and the next wave\u2026).</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Move your player</li><li>Mouse direction: The direction you\u2019re shooting/hitting toward</li><li>Left mouse click, Space: Use equipped weapon (shoot)</li><li>Escape: Pause and quit menu</li><li>Cheat! \u201ck\u201d (think KillAll) is bound to a function that wipes all enemies in the current wave.</li></ul>\n<p>TODOs and ameliorations:</p>\n<ul><li>Balancing! Lots of it.</li><li>More than one type of enemy</li><li>More content in general (Gauntlet types, room prefabs, upgrades\u2026)</li><li>A simpler stat handling system</li><li>A way to indicate \u201cused\u201d upgrades</li><li>A crowd pathfinding algorithm (it gets really really crowded in later waves)</li></ul>\n<p>Regrets:</p>\n<ul><li>Lost way too much time on stats and balancing</li><li>Not enough content</li></ul>\n<p>Points we are proud of:</p>\n<ul><li>Own implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm (by tenshi42), fast and optimized enough for most needs</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T06:50:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a59a6c70e4a3f56b931c2c718c0b685d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["tenshi42", "arc0re", "Konbuscus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
