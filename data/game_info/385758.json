It is one of many attempts at this type of game (which is a pet simulator game). The aim was to make a pet simulator/v-pet game for the PC. Every so often the pet will get hungry and you will have to feed it (You will have to let the game run for time to pass of course. The point of the game right now is to leave it running while you do other stuff, or interact with it if you please). The pet will get hungry every hour or so, maybe earlier, maybe later. You can also go to the 'Zen Garden' to draw in the sand! You can also stroke the pet with the mouse. If you have a touchscreen compatible laptop you can also stroke the pet with your finger using the touchscreen (hopefully. I am not sure about other devices, but it works on mine).</p>\n<p>After trying so many times and constantly not liking the outcome of the idea/art/gameplay I finally said stuff it and built a version of my idea in a couple of days with the aim of just releasing it for fun. I also limited myself to a colour palette consisting of only 8 colours.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype so I don't know what the fate of the project is going to be. Some feedback would be nice :)</p>\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\n<p>- Caleb (LebbyFoxx)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T05:10:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0e/d0ed8ec1316ac6497395d8962244fd11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
