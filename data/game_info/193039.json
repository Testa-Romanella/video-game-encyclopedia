This is a fun little project that really doesn't have a lot of polish on it and is really me just playing around with the Unity asset UFPS and experimenting with level design concepts. I hope to add on to it later for fun and maybe turn it into a real project someday. For now there are 7 levels- 4 of them being first person platforming levels- 3 levels that explore different uses for various weapons included with UFPS. The hope is to one day make unique weapons and additional levels and have some sort of disjointed story around it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0f5b3c03ca295537c1d333cb0584d9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["HitBit"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
