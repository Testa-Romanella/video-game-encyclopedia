Poke or be poked!<br/></p>\n<p>You can either fight versus the AI in singleplayer, or play against someone next to you in the splitscreen multiplayer mode! All of the controls are explained in the game itself, and there aren't many, so it should be easy to get started with!\r\n<br/></p><p>2 player mode requires at least 1 gamepad; it will be assigned to player 1 and player 2 will use the keyboard controls.</p><p>TIPS: I've found that trying to attack head-on usually results in a draw, so maybe try taking your opponent slightly at an angle. If you can manage, the safest option is to attack from either above or below.\r\n<br/></p><p>Music by Liam Sauve (https://twitter.com/liamsauve)<br/>Mountains from the Lowpoly Terrain Pack (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-modular-terrain-p...)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:28:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/741/741147282d2525aedda433cb8dca061d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nihilocrat"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
