Yet, it all feels oddly familiar. Your conscience tells you you're here to repent, but your crime currently escapes you. Has it always been this hard to remember? You notice a TV on a crowded table. The reflection presents you with who you once were. Has it always been this hard to forget?<br/><br/><h3>Seldom do I feel human anymore</h3>Tonight, I Die in My Sleep is an experimental, surreal first-person exploration of dreams and identity. Take the role of an actor participating in a one-man act, stumbling through scenes blending waking nightmares with deteriorating memories. Explore the relationship between art and its creator, between agency and powerlessness. Find meaning in your playthrough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This short narrative-focused experience focuses on providing the player with room for introspection, found primarily through exploration of hand-crafted oneiric spaces governed by dream logic and featuring dreamy ambient soundtrack as well as a fully voiced internal monologue that engages both the player character and the player.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-13T03:57:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/598/598f3c886f5d40c22760d5cb81d9833a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emski"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Troubadour Collective"], "esrb_rating": null}
