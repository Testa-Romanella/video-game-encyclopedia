Also, all components of this game(art, music, code, etc.) were made by me within the game jam time. The only material I\u00a0used from someone else was one easing function from here.\u00a0 Also, this was my first game jam! So, if you're doing the discord titles, here is my discord name:<br/><br/><strong>Discord Name</strong>: Shyguy<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/>Move: arrow keys or asdf<br/>Action: left control<br/><br/><strong>Goal:\u00a0<br/></strong>Gather elements from the colored stations, combine them at the center circle, and feed them to the dragon head. You have to find the right combination that the dragon likes in order to make it grow the most. The dragon is fickle too and changes which combo is its favorite after every level. See how many levels you can get through in the time limit! Completing a level will give you a little more time, but not much,\u00a0so move fast!<br/><br/><strong>Software Used:</strong><br/>-Unity(C#)<br/>-Photoshop<br/>-Audacity<br/><br/>Any feedback is greatly appreciated!<br/><br/>-Derek</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d86afbdc23213c73822c13af78d0fa55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["derek"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
