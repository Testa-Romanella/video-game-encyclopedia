{"id": 571171, "slug": "shadow-plays", "name": "Shadow Play's", "name_original": "Shadow Play's", "description": "\"Shadow Plays\" is a First-Person Indie Horror Demo Game which places the players into the shoes of an arriving member of the Priory called Ordo Mortuus Vita. The Priory promises to heal wounds of the mind, and to revitalize the pains of the body. A specialized researcher in esoteric sciences has taken residency with full support from the Priory. His research hopes to further deepen the knowledge at what may lie beyond after death. His hopes are to make contact with the beyond, and see what secrets it is willing to reveal. Though not everything is as it seems, an investigation was prompted after an increase of missing people were being reported around the area, and coincidently a number of new faces have appeared at The Priory.\r\nDisclaimer:\u00a0\r\nMake sure to read every note you open in-game to fully understand &amp; keep up with the story in order to move on.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T08:25:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36e057a70568e7e878a8e49ee9b8f109.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nako Baev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
