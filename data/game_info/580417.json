She's been able to keep these feelings under wraps, but now that the whole gang is meeting up for the local TAGFest convention, there's no way Sonia can put this off any further! With just 3 days to confess her feelings, Sonia will have to navigate the halls of love as well as artist alleys, free play arcades, and tabletop games to finally confess what she's been feeling all this time!</p>\n<p>This is a demo of the final game, which is expected to be released at the end of April. <br/></p>\n<p>~20-30 mins to complete.<br/></p>\n<p>Art by WitPOP</p>\n<p>Music by Ketsa<br/></p>\n<p>This game was a\u00a0NaNoRenO 2021 Game Jam submission.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T06:57:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/286/2868e945de6c24f2d5b9351dd5172543.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TinySamm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
