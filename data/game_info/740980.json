I have set the size to 40%,\u00a0But sometimes by default it resets it to 100%, you can reduce it to at least 50% from the options menu\u00a0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T10:01:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cd83b3c4d671906ccbcdabae8597825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Respawned Gamers!", "OMG!
