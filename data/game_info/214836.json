Each card is either a 1, 2, 3, or Voltorb. 1 does nothing,\u00a02 and 3 multiply your round score by the respective number, and a Voltorb makes your score 0 and ends the round. In order to guess what cards are what, you are told the sum of all numbers and number of voltorbs in each row and column. Once you find all of the 2s and the 3s, the round ends and you win.</p>\n<p>Unique to this version are the defuse and random buttons, both of which make the game easier while keeping a level of depth. Clicking the defuse button makes it so that you cannot lose on your next card flip, even if it's a Voltorb, and the Random button reveals a random card. Both of these abilities can only be used once a round, so used them carefully.</p>\n\n<p>Click a card to flip it</p>\n<p>Use the 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 buttons to place stamps, helping you to mark cards with what you think they might be.</p>\n<p>Hold space to remove any stamps under your cursor.</p>\n<p>Use the Slider at the top to set what level you will start at, from 1 to 5.</p>\n<p>Use the \"End\" button to start a new round and save your round score to your overall total.</p>\n\n<p>If you want a more genuine experience, you may want to listen to this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/595/59557e94867db48ca376ea75fd40ce36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mariostar7"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
