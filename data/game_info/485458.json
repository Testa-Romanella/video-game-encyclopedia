I grew up by the seaside, but I've been living inland for the last two decades, so I guess it's a mid-life crisis thing.</p>\n<p>I've seen games like Fishing Barents Sea and thought how wonderful it would be to work on a game that would scratch my itch for just sitting in a boat in the middle of the sea.</p>\n<p>This \"Low Effort Jam\" came along, so I downloaded a model of a boat from sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/fisher-boat-385b039e95754dca8d8c045ed0c515cf), imported it into Godot, tweaked the default environment set up, found a good camera position, added a couple of animators to the boat and one to the camera to simulate swaying.</p>\n<p>The result was Seasick Simulator. No real point to the game - just sit and watch for as long as you're comfortable. When you've had enough, click the \"I've had enough\" button to quit.</p>\n<p>The itch was scratched. A little :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T03:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32b4214a7bc1596e2257fcd65ef774d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["meatgirl"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
