It was inspired from my previous platformer Hermes and even Mario Bros. Have fun. Level 2 is very hard and you many feel like rage-quitting, but i have played every level and it is not impossible to finish the level, just frustrating. There are only 2 levels in the game as of now, will surely update it with more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T11:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dce/dce9c106fa2a50fc88e6c33cb5e3c1ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["helloharsharocks"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
