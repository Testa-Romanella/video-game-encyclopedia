There are 10 levels in this game starting from helping u get a feel of the controls to the ultimate test of your gaming skill. The objective of the game is to touch the flag located at the end of each level before you run out of time.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The controls for this game are really simple:-<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>'W' O Up Arrow to move forward.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong></li><li><strong>'S'\u00a0 Or Down Arrow\u00a0to move backward.</strong></li><li> <strong>'A' Or Left Arrow\u00a0to move left.</strong></li><li><strong>'D' Or Right Arrow to move right.</strong></li><li><strong>Left Shift Or Right Shift to sprint (you have to hold shift).</strong></li><li><strong>Mouse to look around.</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>For the moment there is some bug around the buttons in the game. I will release an update later in which it is fixed. Until then these keyboard keys can be used</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>'B' to restart your current level.</strong></li><li><strong>'N' to enter the next level.</strong></li><li><strong>'M' to exit to the main menu.</strong></li><li><strong>'L' to quit the game at any stage and close the app.<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>I will release many updates in the future which will include various difficulty levels and different game modes. Also the mouse sensitivity maybe extremely high in the browser version so I suggest you download the game.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I hope you enjoy this game. Have fun playing!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you would like to play some of my other games check these out:-</strong></p>\n<p>https://nikthegreat2020.itch.io/the-living-dead\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>https://nikthegreat2020.itch.io/the-living-dead-returns\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://nikthegreat2020.itch.io/space-defender</p>\n<p>https://nikthegreat2020.itch.io/barrier-alert</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T09:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/0000a3b1b99b77ba4c35e2ce296ac3a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["nikthegreat2020"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
