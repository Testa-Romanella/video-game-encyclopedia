A game about rolling dice; characters move as if they were dice. Sometimes they fight, and the bigger number wins.<br/></p>\n<p>Mr. Dice Guy is stuck in a mobster's casino, and it'll take more than a lucky spin to roll through the enemies in his path.</p><p>HOW TO PLAY: Move around with the directional arrows/D-pad. The number on\u00a0 your face changes as you roll around. If you step next to an enemy, \u00a0you fight, and the bigger number wins. Ties are decided by a coin toss.<br/></p>\n<p>Made with the Godot engine</p>\n<p>This was coded entirely by myself, and current assets were contributed by friends who wanted to help with the art side of things. They did some great work!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T01:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72a/72a418158352152bbcf2fc9d01e86a8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MetalGearSamus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
