The action takes place in the midst of the cold war, which has an impact on the course of events.</p>\n<p>The primary task is to ensure the fulfillment of five basic needs for each resident: food (the requirement to build farms), housing (if a resident does not have a house, or he has nothing to pay for it, he makes shacks that spoil the beauty of the city and increase crime), religion (construction of temples), entertainment (build bars, cafes, cinemas) and medical support (construction of hospitals)</p>\n<p>How the government provides these aspects to its residents depends on the level of satisfaction of the population, as each need is different for each resident. If the level of happiness is low, the people can go to the rebels. And when the rebels accumulate a lot, they attack various objects, including the Palace. Undermining the Palace means defeat in the game, so in case of a low level of happiness, a vast army has to suppress the riots. But the military, in turn, must also be happy with life. Otherwise, a military coup may occur.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2009-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T10:48:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d49/d4974f5eb9e6c47794f681f149280d9d.jpg", "website": "http://www.tropico3.com", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 147, "owned": 3021, "beaten": 100, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 150, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 49, "ratings_count": 269, "suggestions_count": 518, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 269, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Haemimont Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kalypso Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
