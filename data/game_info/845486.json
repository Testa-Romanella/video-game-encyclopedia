Get near an enemy and the battle starts automatically. Use the \"I\" key or the Inventory button to view your weapons/shields and swap items. When near a chest, press \"O\" to open it. Each weapon, shield,\u00a0and enemy will be randomly assigned an element. The Element affects the damage during battle. Use the Element Table to determine the multiplier for the attacking element for each defending element.\u00a0During battle, there is an opportunity to Flee if needed if the\u00a0enemy is too strong or where your weapon's elements do not work to your advantage. Fleeing or losing battles reduces your XP; winning battles, exploring, and opening chests increases your XP and levels up your character.</p>\n<p>Game only works in Microsoft Windows, sorry.</p>\n\n<p>File can also be downloaded from Github. I will be posting text files of the code separately as well to prevent the need to download the Excel file. In this version of the Excel file, the \"data\" tabs that contain tables with statistics and other information used in the game are hidden to make it easy to install and play; the dev version on Github has all those tabs in view if you wanted to change a setting to make the game different.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/weenie-walker-games/Basic_Jam<br/></p>\n\n<p>Artwork for the game were 3D models obtained from the Unity Asset Store and converted to 2D images with a tool in the Unity game engine.</p>\n<p>Level Art: Mana Station (https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/12379)</p>\n<p>Player and some Enemies:\u00a0Infinity PBR (https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/4645)</p>\n<p>Additional Enemies: Protofactor, Inc (https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/265)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T14:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf41829dc1bc52d2156b1af4ab497de7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Weenie Walker Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
