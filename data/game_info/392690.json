(With a persistent world.)\u00a0Level up by grinding monsters and then defeat the end boss. Works in multiplayer, you can either join the server I'm running (which I hope to keep up as much as possible for a while), run your own server (through the options menu) or play offline alone. Has built in online chat, so you can chat up new friends and have fun together. The end boss is supposed to be like a raid boss, bring friends to try to defeat him. (No idea if it's actually possible, but should be, I think.) There's also a bit of story in the options section.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD, hold RMB to aim, LMB to shoot. 1, 2 for special abilities. Enter for chat/cursor to get level ups. Escape/M for menu. Space to jump. Numpad \"+\" and \"-\" change quality settings, if performance is an issue (lower settings also limit framerate to 30)</p>\n<p>If the connection to the default server fails for whatever reason, try changing it to \"pieserver.ddns.net\" and \"8888\" for the port in the options on the login screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T06:00:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/739/739a37bc14c66e25e1f76f957027ba4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bohrium"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
