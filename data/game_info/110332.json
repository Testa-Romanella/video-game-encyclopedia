It's meant to be played on it's first playthrough as an exploration game and from then on as a race. Also an exploration of low resolution graphics and minimal HUD; all information about the player is displayed on the character (save for the timer itself).</p><p>The only attack available is to dash. Enemies hit by it will go flying, with the possibility of hitting other enemies. Originally the game was meant to be about this mechanic, but technical issues with how to aim the launched enemies made it unfun.</p><p>It's my first completed project in a long, long time, so I hope you will all enjoy it. All assets were made by me.</p><p>controls are: z to jump and double jump, x to dash. Holding up or down while pressing x will make you dash in those directions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/182e8d4a76ea09a138f9b9d6b8049b00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rastek"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
