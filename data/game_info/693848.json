{"id": 693848, "slug": "pokemon-x-gfuel", "name": "Pokemon x GFuel", "name_original": "Pokemon x GFuel", "description": "<p>A Pokemon and G Fuel collaboration starter pack is here for you to open! What card will you get? There are 3 total cards available, each an evolution of the G Fuel Pokemon:\u00a0Scoopole, Gifueleon, and Gatoadrade.</p>\n<p>Click the Starter Pack to tear\u00a0it, and click it again it open it up and see which card you got. If you would like to open a new pack and see if you got a dupe or a new card, just\u00a0select \"Want a different card?\".</p>\n<p>I find coding to be really challenging and difficult, so I\u00a0wanted to create something simple that would mainly focus on my art. The \"G Fuel Pokemon\"\u00a0concept was something I came up with during lecture when we were instructed to create \"cursed Pokemon\", and I\u00a0came up with the \"Gifueleon\" design.\u00a0 I thought it ended up being really\u00a0cute and decided to base my poster around an ad for how a Pokemon and G Fuel collaboration pack would look like. At first I wanted to create something more complicated in p5.js, such as an ad for the pack that would contain pop up ads encouraging you to consume more and more products, but it was a bit too ambitious for what I had time to learn to write and draw the art for. Instead, I\u00a0decided on a simple interaction that would feel chill and give a bit of the fun of opening a pack of cards and seeing what you get.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Features music from this lovely Youtube video:</p>Wrapper Sound Effect clipped from this Youtube video:<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/912a67cada8af1baf8cd72e3f88a6937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bookercatcheli"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
