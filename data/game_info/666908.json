Fortunately enough, some rangers have put up giant electrocuted lights that lure those insects into certain death.</p>\n<p>But oh no, those traps also lure in giant moths that get stuck to the trap and cast a shadow in the woods.</p>\r\nAnd when there is no light for the insects, they start coming after YOU.\r\n<p>Lucky for you, you got your trusty old\u00a0flashlight to lure the moths away from the trap so that the mosquitos wont chase you.</p>\n<p>Now you just have to survive\u00a0until dawn. Good luck.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>To control your character your screen is divided into 2 separate sections that mimic two analog sticks.\u00a0The left area controls your movement and the right one controls your look direction. Both sticks are in relative mode, so it doesn't matter where you start your gesture from.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Art by Corinna Rath &amp; Thomas Hedden<br/>Coding by Arne Urff &amp; Max</strong><strong>\u00a0Kruse</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T04:36:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ff/6ff0f1ab5c2712e7161ef3ff46ce6d84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nomad404"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
