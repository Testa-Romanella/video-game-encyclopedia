{"id": 586409, "slug": "blocketship", "name": "BLOCKETSHIP", "name_original": "BLOCKETSHIP", "description": "<p>Blocketship is a casual space dodge game.</p>\n<p>It was made for Mottzy's Jammy Jam where we had to make it blocky and the theme was \"embiggen.\" To make it blocky I used an oversized pixel style and the asteroids are blocks in various sizes. The theme was implemented by increasing the size of the blocketship as you gather payloads.</p>\n<p>The blue items with green up arrows are payloads. These will increase how much your score increases over time and also increases the size of the ship.</p>\n<p>The pink items with red down arrows are also payloads, but these will repair the ship, reduce the payload number, and also reduce the size of the ship by 1.</p>\n<p>Avoid the asteroids, they will damage the blocketship. If your ships hit points reach 0, they ship will be destroyed and your game will be over.</p>\n<p>As your score increases the games difficulty increases.</p>\n<p>Controls - Use the arrow keys to move the ship about the screen.</p>\n<p>I plan to add a leaderboard in the future, and maybe even port this to a mobile platform in the future. For now just add your score (screenshot if possible)\u00a0in the comments.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T05:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c2/9c2143575315e783a09a5c8da81f01de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
