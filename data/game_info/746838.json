Survive the scary ocean depths until a rescue boat arrives!</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move. Avoid the big shark.\u00a0Press spacebar to flash your light (can only use while not moving). Press \"f\" to use the flare. It will slow the shark down, but the flare only lasts for 20 seconds! Collect oxygen tanks to replenish your oxygen. You will only gain oxygen when not moving. Avoid the fake sharks which will take oxygen away and stun you, and avoid the real shark which will drain your health.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game fits the game jam theme through most of the sharks being hallucinations that you need to avoid. Since they are hallucinations, they will not kill you, but they will shock you, demobilizing you for a few seconds, while taking oxygen away.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T08:54:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298a86868efc944927756158ce8c2886.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["StrikeLight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
