Sean rescued his best friend Haraku from the clutches of the evil bald wizard Xelar on his 7th birthday party. All seemed well and apart from the occasional scream coming from the mountains (I'm not bald!) it seemed like Xelar and his wicked army had vanished for good. Until the fateful day Sean turned 8 and suddenly had to face his arch-nemesis again. This time he was captured himself and transported to an even more magical and remote world. What to do? Luckily his trusty (and not yet rusty) sword was in his hand when Xelar whisked him away. Now Sean has to once again become Super Sean and defeat countless new enemies, explore new levels and hopefully vanquish the bald evildoer once and for all!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSuper Sean 008: Xelar's Revenge features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Dozens of new enemies<br/>\r\n- Many new magical places to wander through <br/>\r\n- Fast paced 2D Jump &amp; Run Action<br/>\r\n- Multi-language support<br/>\r\n- A symphonic soundtrack <br/>\r\n- A chance to defeat Xelar and his evil minions once and for all!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-28T05:59:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/9572b6aebb4219ee229cfc0140e289db.jpg", "website": "http://www.crxentertainment.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CRX Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CRX Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
