After an unconditional surrender, it reshaped the world into its own design, constructing gigantic megastructures to house and protect the human race. Over time, those\u00a0who refused to join were slowly tracked down and assimilated.</p>\n<p>By the year 2080, over ninety-nine percent of the human population lives under BASILISK's occupation. Those who do their part, and obey its directives live lives of comfort and safety, sustained on universal basic income, and provided endless entertainment. Yet, despite the uncanny allure of the machine and its works, there are some who still oppose it.</p>\n<p>You play as Roko, one of the few remaining humans free of BASILISK's influence. After sustaining a plasma bolt to the left temple in a fatal run-in with the authorities, he was recovered by a local resistance enclave and had his mind digitized into a special chip capable of storing human consciousness\u00a0in a last-ditch resort to save his life.</p>\n<p>Now re-uploaded into his own body, with the left half of his face reconstructed from steel, Roko finds himself trapped in Complex One, stripped of his memories, and certain of one thing and one thing only: the BASILISK must fall.</p>\n<p><strong>MOVEMENT</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement options are boundless in BASILISK. Since you're a cyborg, your body is capable of feats that are normally impossible.</p>\n<ul><li><em>Moving: </em>By pressing the WASD or Arrow Keys, you can move while on the ground, and in midair.</li><li><em>Sprinting:\u00a0</em>By pressing either Shift key, you can move significantly faster.</li><li><em>Jumping:\u00a0</em>By pressing the Spacebar, you can jump into the air.</li><li><em>Crouching:\u00a0</em>By pressing either CTRL key, you can crouch down.</li><li><em>Hyper-Dashing:\u00a0</em>By pressing E or Slash, you can rapidly dash\u00a0in the direction you are currently moving!</li><li><em>Wall-Running:\u00a0</em>By pressing the movement keys towards a wall while in midair, you can run across it!</li><li><em>Sliding:\u00a0</em>By pressing the crouch key while sprinting, you can enter into a slide that allows you to slip under narrow passages while maintaining your speed!\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>COMBAT</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As for combat, you have four primary weapons:</p>\n<ul><li><em>The Headripper Shotgun: </em>A high damage but wildly inaccurate weapon, good for close-quarters combat.</li><li><em>The Sentinel Handgun:\u00a0</em>A precise, high calibre handgun. Good for medium to long-range encounters.</li><li><em>The Volatile SMG:\u00a0</em>A bullet hose that fires at ludicrous RPM. Good at many different ranges, but hard to aim reliably\u00a0due to high recoil.</li><li><em>The Cutter Plasmablade:\u00a0</em>A plasma blade capable of cutting the toughest metal. Effective range:\u00a0roughly an arm's length.</li></ul>\n<p>You have the following actions with each weapon:</p>\n<ul><li><em>Fire / Swing:\u00a0</em>By pressing Left Mouse Button, you can fire or swing your current weapon.</li><li><em>Special:\u00a0</em>By pressing Right Mouse Button, you can activate a weapon's special ability (currently, only the Cutter has this)</li><li><em>Switch:\u00a0</em>By scrolling the Scroll Wheel, or pressing keys 1-4, you can switch between your weapons.</li><li><em>Reload:\u00a0</em>By pressing R or Enter, you can reload your weapon</li></ul>\n<p><strong>OTHER MECHANICS</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Stealth:\u00a0</em>You are initially undetected by enemies, but gradually get noticed the more you stay in their line of sight. If you manage to hit them with an attack while they're unaware, you deal bonus damage!</li><li><em>Crits:\u00a0</em>Attacking an opponent in their weak spot (typically the head) will result in your damage being doubled!</li><li><em>Rage:\u00a0</em>Dealing successive damage to enemies without taking damage yourself builds up your Rage meter, which increases in three successive tiers. At each tier, you gain a boost to your reload speed, attack damage, movement speed, and more!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks a bunch for playing my game :)</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback is appreciated!
