Unfortunately, our process is a big mess. Our boss buy great splinters printers but don't care about stock.<br/>So, it's your task to manage all orders and be careful on stock ! If it's full, it's explode\u00a0<em>(We know, splinters are quite dangerous).</em></p>\n<p>I'm confident, you seems to be the seller we need (not we deserve, thanks for you time).</p>\n<p>This is a simply game on which you have to move splinters *(color blocks)* to booked orders and extend your stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls :</em></strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Move splinters -&gt; Left mouse button on the splinter you would move and another left mouse button click on where you would move it (If you move on another splinter, they will switch their position).</li><li>Select splinters and Orders -&gt; Right mouse button to select Splinters and Orders. To book an order, you have to select all splinters ask and the order.</li><li>Pause - Escape to Pause the game (Escape another time and it's stop the pause).</li><li>Ctrl + F4 - Don't use it, legends says that it could destroy our reality (or at least reality in your screen).</li></ul>\n<p><em>Short advice, it's very tricky with trackpad.
