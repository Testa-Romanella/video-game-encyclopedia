Against the phone, the Pro mode scores regularly and zeroes in on the net.  Score a goal by landing directly in the opposing net, and earn a point.  When you reach the goal line, but do not make it to the net, the game will give a \"No Goal\" message.<br/><br/>If you delay the game by waiting longer than 10 seconds to make a move, you get a penalty.  When you get 3 penalties, your opponent is awarded 1 point.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc3a681a4e8d591b09d1cc4256cd9596.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Little Family Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Little Family Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
