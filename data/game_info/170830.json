I mean, CAAAAAAAALIFORNIAAAAA is a bit of a burden to my ears, that are comforted easily by the likes of good quality music. one day, grimes will create an album with liturgy. mark my words) to r. kelly (he pisses me off. NOW THAT JOKE WAS VERY EDGY. MADE ME LAUGH!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHAHAHAHHA YOU ARE SO CLEVER), there is just a lot of variation here.</p>director's commentary<p>basically this is yet another creation of mine. it is just like a terribly fast world (which I liked at first, but now, it is just a journey through the plunging depths of cringe that makes me feel so embarassed. it really does make me cringe these days), but slightly less cringeworthy. there still is a plethora of dumb references to music, television and other things here, so, if you want to cringe slightly, you will love this game.<br/>however, you will not fully cringe because this game is a step forward from atfw. there are maps that you can see from a top down perspective (very technological, I know), more detail to the worlds and slightly better graphics. you will be surprised to see this level of modernism in the game.<br/>the game also features these really dumb sample based tracks. the results will make you vomit because of how bad they are, and you will probably consume your own poop.</p><p>a bad musician once said, \"if youre reading this, its too late\". we can all fully agree with this bad musician's quote, because... it's true! if you happen to be reading this, it is indeed, too late. you haven't downloaded the game, you fool! download it, dammit! you are not a true gamer, you little version of the breed bettween grimes and kanye west!! hahahahaaha!! laughter ensues as the big lebowski attacks the warner brothers hahahahahahahaha lmao what is wrong with me... huh... you know... life is something.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/494/494bf3b1cd62d24d1188d74bb222bc95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pouls"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
