It has also a help feature.<br/><br/>The aim of this game is to remove all the balls, but one, from the game board.<br/><br/>A ball is removed when another ball jumps over it.<br/><br/>A ball may jump over another ball if it is in an adjacent place to it (up, or down, left, right), and if the destination slot on the other side is empty.<br/><br/>To move a ball, first touch it: its colour will change to blue; then touch the destination place.The ball will move to destination, and the ball in the middle will disappear.<br/><br/>If you are a champion, you will end the game with the last ball in the board centre.<br/><br/>If you are not satisfied of our last move(s), you can undo one or more of them, using the Undo Move button.<br/><br/>If you can't find a valid sequence of moves, you can get a hint touching the Auto Move button: the next valid move (if any) will be automatically executed. But  be aware that this feature requires a lot of computations, so you may have to wait several seconds for an automatic move.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/061/061fb1ecb4223975f07aa87968572b7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "esrb_rating": null}
