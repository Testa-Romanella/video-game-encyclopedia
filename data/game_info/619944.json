{"id": 619944, "slug": "icarus-4", "name": "Icarus", "name_original": "Icarus", "description": "<p>ICARUS is a session-based PvE survival game for up to eight co-op players.</p>\n<p>Endure a savage alien wilderness on Icarus, humanity\u2019s greatest mistake. Survive its brutal environment as you explore, harvest, craft and hunt while seeking your fortune.</p>\n<p>From their orbital space station, prospectors drop down to the planet surface for limited time mission sessions in search of rare, valuable exotic materials. Those lucky enough to survive will return to orbit to convert their exotics into advanced technology and take on ever more challenging drops. Those that get left behind... are lost forever.</p>\n<p>Icarus was once destined to be a second Earth, but when terraforming collapsed - the air turned toxic and humanity\u2019s hopes of colonizing a new world died. Icarus became a joke, a symbol of humanity reaching for the stars and failing. Yet when xeno-biologists discovered the cause of the failure - exotic matter - new interest was ignited. Valuable beyond reckoning, these \u2018exotics\u2019 sparked a gold rush that fueled political tensions between factions on Earth and brought prospectors flocking to Icarus.</p>\n<p>Confront and conquer a brutal PvE world determined to wear you down or tear you apart.</p>\n<p>From toxic atmosphere to savage wildlife and game-altering weather events, Icarus is a planet with a temper. Preparation and planning are everything, whether it\u2019s to find a source of oxygen, stalk your next meal or stock supplies for a long journey into the wilderness.</p>\n<p>Immerse yourself in a deceptively familiar, yet alien, world.</p>\n<p>The First Cohort of prospectors has been granted initial mining licenses for over 64 square kilometers of hand-crafted terrain full of hidden corners and resources to mine and diverse biomes to explore. Use the resources around you to survive - every single tree is harvestable, every rock can be voxel mined.</p>\n<p>Master two separate tech trees: planet-side and orbital.</p>\n<p>Use the planet\u2019s resources to craft tools, structures and machinery to protect yourself and aid your mission. Then return to orbit with rare exotic materials that you can engineer into advanced tech. Choose which tech to take on your next drop so you can complete missions faster, travel further, automate production or improve your odds of survival.</p>\n<p>Your time on Icarus is limited, so always watch the clock and use every second wisely.</p>\n<p>The orbital space station waits for no one. If you fail to return to your dropship in time, there is no rescue. Your character\u2019s progression and tech is lost to planet Icarus. Every drop has a clear goal and time limit, but how you overcome its challenges... is up to you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T10:29:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d66c38dedaf68ff0bd73087128016a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.88, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 251, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 32, "dropped": 18, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 13, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 25, "suggestions_count": 483, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 25, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RocketWerkz", "Denis Evans"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RocketWerkz", "Japster's Cavern"], "esrb_rating": null}
