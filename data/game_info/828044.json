{"id": 828044, "slug": "qonquest", "name": "Qonquest", "name_original": "Qonquest", "description": "<p><strong>Qonquest\u00a0</strong>is a simple strategy game, running purely in the terminal. \u00a0Currently there's only singleplayer (multiplayer will be added in a future update).</p>\n<p>Type \"help\" in any mode to get help. In a turn there's currently two actions you can do: deployment and movement. All deployment is done before movement, and you can only move\u00a0<em>all</em> troops in a province, and only to adjacent provinces. \u00a0When moving to a province not owned by you, a battle will occur. Each round of the battle, the attacker rolls 2 dice, and the defender rolls 3. The top 2 of these dice are then compared, and whoever got the lowest rolls of either comparison loses 1 troop (and since there are two dice there's three outcomes - defender loses 2, both lose 1, and attacker loses 2). The player always has the first turn.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:\u00a0</strong>If you're using the itch.io desktop app, you may have to manually navigate to the game files and launch the exe directly instead of clicking itch's \"launch\" button. This is because itch does not by default launch games in interactive terminal mode.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T15:42:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9eb92d4bc85abaded13b9ea935ffdec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheZipCreator"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
