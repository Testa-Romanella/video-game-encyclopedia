This is my first completed project and first to be posted publicly anywhere...but I'm far from finished! I love the simplistic, clicker gameplay of it so I'd like to refine it a bit more before I say I'm done with it once and for all. I developed <strong>Rush Hour</strong> with Unity 5 personal edition. All the art and audio assets were also made by myself, using software like Gimp, Audacity, and bfxr.net.</p>\n<p><strong>Rush Hour</strong> was originally conceived as a mobile game (hence the weird aspect ratio) and I may still look to release it on a mobile platform, but I'd like to refine some of the rougher edges of it before I do so. I've already started working on implementing music into the game and I have a couple new and interesting ideas for gameplay I'd like to try out, like different game modes and locally stored high scores.</p>\n<p>Please give it a download and let me know what you think! Everything is included in a .zip folder, simply unpackage it and run <strong>RushHour.exe</strong> for a fun, clicker adventure!</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Currently <strong>Rush Hour</strong> has only been built for PC, Mac, &amp; Linux standalone, but more builds will hopefully be on the way! If you experience any bugs or have any questions or comments on the game, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a76/a76b32f96a58b402b9deed2580758c69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["McKnickKnock"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
