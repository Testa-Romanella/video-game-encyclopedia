After you complete this game, you will know all 33 letters of the alphabet, and over 100 words! You can choose to learn either Ukrainian or Russian, as they have very similar alphabets.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFirst Taya will teach you how each letter sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThen, flip cards with the letters, in a simple relaxing game, to help familiarise yourself with each letter, and the different way it looks when it's BIG or small.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPractice remembering each letter by listening to Taya, she will say a letter, and then you must click on the card that matches.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter practising, face an epic boss fight against Baba Yaga. This will test your knowledge, and when you win, it will prove that you have mastered the alphabet.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter the alphabet, you will be able to sound out words based on their spelling. There are over 100 words to learn as well, by fighting Baba Yaga again with objects instead of letters.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T03:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/1078c2663b6acddd4ae74a049456bd0b.jpg", "website": "https://www.hibbygames.com/tayas-alphabet", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hibby Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hibby Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
