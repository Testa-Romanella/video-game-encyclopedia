The Grand Master of course, follows that latter, and while he isn\u2019t that old or wise, he never pays for his food, even when he eats at the \"not so friendly\" ninja cafe. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game, you must best the ninjas who want you to pay for your bill.  You know, like a normal person.  But you\u2019re a Grand Master, and you don\u2019t follow those rules.
