There is not much gameplay, as I wanted to experiment mostly with movement on uneven terrain and how to best handle that, but gave some context via a story. The story has two endings, though the game will quit as soon as you reach the ending.\u00a0A more comprehensive ending and audio \u00a0may be added but that was not the intention of this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made in the span of about six hours, using Unity. The\u00a0Smart Lighting 2D asset was used to handle lighting. Beyond that, everything was done by me and will likely continue to be done only by me.</p>\n<p>Inspiration for this project was two fold, primarily wanting to experiment with above mentioned movement, and secondly I have trouble sleeping at night often, so figured this was a good representation of the stuff I dream up\u00a0being out to get me haha.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:16:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbd/cbd4157dab58001a36a39b5b730b8724.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["knightrealm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
