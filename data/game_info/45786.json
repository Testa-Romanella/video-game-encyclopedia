It also features bombs.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBuilding on the fast-paced, Match-X gameplay of the original, Crystal Journeys adds a range of new features and obstacles that will test your ability to think on your feet. Fight against the clock as you clear out blocked tiles and impenetrable walls with multipliers, extra timers and explosions in your arsenal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere\u2019s a 20 step tutorial to guide you through the basic features of the game, a Journey procedural game mode that grow increasingly harder as you progress, and we also threw in 36 hard-as-nails challenges that you won\u2019t pass unless you master each power-up and game mechanic fully.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBuilding up on the strengths of innovative gameplay and fast-paced arcade block dropping that has nothing to do with sagas, candy, pop or rocks, we have refined the formula for the modern marriage of Tetris and Lumines.
