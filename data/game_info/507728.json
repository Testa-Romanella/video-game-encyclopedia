The reaper will keep on bouncing back and forth and you need to jump over these obstacles by pressing space bar to avoid death. At a certain score milestone, there's a chance where the obstacles are being generated more than one in a single map, thus a double jump feature is added to survive from the obstacles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/560e1c256a11d63b74ed97791d434120.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BGDC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
