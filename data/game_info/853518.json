Some Mods include:</p>\n<ol><li>Snow on mountains.<ol><li>Spent a significant amount of time trying to create a realistic look.</li></ol></li><li>Grass terrain with patches of snow.</li><li>Expanded level size to include the entire terrain area. Note: For example purposes, only a few enemies exist near the beginning of the level.</li><li>Created two levels:<ol><li>Casual (where player can't die)</li><li>Timed (where player can die and has a certain time limit)<ol><li>Created script to load game over screen when timer was completed and to display timer text in the UI.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Instead of using portal to win level, level is won by defeating a particular enemy triggering the LevelCleared() function upon death. Can you find and kill the right enemy?</li><li>Other mods that may be, but not limited to, health settings, camera rotation speed for better aiming, and more.</li></ol>\n<p>TIP: Do not use mouse to aim. Instead, keep mouse steady and line up your aim as you walk around. Use WASD keys to move and left mouse click to shoot.</p>\n\n<p>Created by: Donald Faulknor</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T11:55:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76de41f5e79e2f96e9cc50f922eeceb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["d14u82"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
