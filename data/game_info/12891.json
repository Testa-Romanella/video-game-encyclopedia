The game also features online multiplayer with 2-6 players. The gameplay consists of dice rolling and making moves while doing the actions envisaged by the in-game cards or the tiles the player occupies. There are several characters to play with different stats and multiple cards in the deck including events, stuff, and characters.  Each player picks a character (there is a total of 12 in the board version and 74 in Steam one) and starts a journey from own tile. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The story behind the dice rolling centers around the Talisman world in which the powerful wizard once reigned with the help of his Crown of Command.
