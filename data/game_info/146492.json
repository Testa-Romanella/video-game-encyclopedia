Flip switches, change plug sockets, and make sure to get everything working right!\u00a0Explore the house and see what weird stuff you collect!</p>\n<p>There exists a possibility this will get worked on further if it does well in the voting. I loved working on it, it's my first game jam and my first really completed project! I think you'll love it!</p><p>It should be mentioned, most of the levels actually want you to turn on all the lights. They start off, actually. But, time came to it, and this was the most I could do. So, turn on the $%&amp;@ lights, you brave player!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/788/7882ee199fa1f842e2a262e8e26f1323.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Princess Digit"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
