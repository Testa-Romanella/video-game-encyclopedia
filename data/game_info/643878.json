But what happens when there's nothing left to break?</p>\n<p>WASD movement, but one direction at a time</p>\n<p>E to interact with things</p>\n<p>Escape to restart</p>\n\n<p>I started working on this game 2 days before the Curdle Jam\u00a0ended. Instead of quitting the Jam, I decided to try it, even though I had less time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I also tried to create a game\u00a0without ANY\u00a0 external reference for the first time, so no tutorials, and no opening my other projects.</p>\n\n<p>It's a short game, but the actual point is to let the player blow off steam by destroying my *beautiful* apartment xD. So I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Shoutout to Chandy57\u00a0for helping with the name</p>\n<p>Shoutout to\u00a0Rexary for helping with the Idea</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T05:41:40", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicyoZ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
