{"id": 372603, "slug": "gas-station-simulator", "name": "Gas Station Simulator", "name_original": "Gas Station Simulator", "description": "Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of the broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate. Just don\u2019t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy those that can\u2019t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements.<br />\nThe more you widen your gas station\u2019s appeal, the more customer demands will vary. The truckers want a healthy meal and a shower while the Tesla driver wants a Latte while he waits for his car to charge up. Expand the range of services you offer by adding stations, buildings and appropriate equipment. Why not expand and build a shop area, build a car wash station or even a small motel? How about some slot machines to ramp up the profits?<br />\nRestoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built, ranging from your own color schemes, the name of your gas station to decorations inside and outside.<br />\nDon\u2019t forget to advertise! Letting people know about your existence and services you expand will drive even more customers to you. It might not come cheap, but pays for itself in the long run.<br />\nServing your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up and their food served right away. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it\u2019s less hectic. Proper time management and closing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy.<br />\nYou can try, but the more you expand the less likely that you will be able to manage it all on your own. Hire the right people to help you run your business, but keep a close eye on them. Some employees might just not do their job right, slack, lack the right attitude to serve customers or even steal.<br />\nYou can\u2019t sell what you don\u2019t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. You can also opt to increase your profits further by procuring from less reputable sources. Remember the gas truck that went missing last week the newspaper wrote about? Well, a shady character is just offering you a full gas delivery at half the price\u2026<br />\nOr maybe you want to take some shadier goods into your offer, the profit margins certainly are enticing.<br />\nSometimes it just isn\u2019t possible to keep every customer happy, some are just out to get you. Don\u2019t worry, you have many stupid and mean things you can do to take revenge on such people. Drop their food, be extra slow to hand things over, shake their soda real good or just throw stuff at them. Dozens of ways to get back at those nasty ones. Just don\u2019t overdo it, others might be watching.<br />\nIrritating or shady customers, your staff breaking or stealing things or too much pressure are by far not the only situations you\u2019ll have to deal with. You have a triving business and some people just want a piece of it. You will have to find means and ways to deal with robbery or extortion attempts not to mention vandalism or the occasional level of stupidity.Key FeaturesWide range of choices and approaches in every aspect of the game.<br />\nExpansive feature set for renovation.<br />\nin-depth features to expand and run your business.<br />\nHigh level of customization in all areas.<br />\nDetailed financial aspects of the entire operation.<br />\nMore than 100 expansion and upgrade options.<br />\nMore than 20 customer types and 50+ customers.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2021-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-27T04:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/050/050288ef5c2ecb1e8272caf0ce077d7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.87, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 781, "beaten": 44, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 31, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 208, "ratings_count": 63, "suggestions_count": 414, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 68, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drago Entertainment"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Movie Games", "DRAGO entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
