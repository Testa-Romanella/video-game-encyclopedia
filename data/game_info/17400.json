This now includes all PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) channels, based on the most accurate conversion algorithm out there.<br/><br/><strong>HIGH QUALITY OUTPUTS</strong><br/><br/>Bitmap2Material lets you extract all the possible maps from a single image: this now includes PBR channels such base color (or albedo), metallic, roughness but also normal, height, specular, curvature, AO etc.<br/><br/><strong>ADJUST HIGHLIGHTS AND SHADOWS</strong><br/><br/>This allows you to create the base color (or albedo) for PBR and can be done in just a few clicks.<br/><br/><strong>REMOVE SEAMS</strong><br/><br/>Bitmap2Material provides the ability to make any material tile. You do not need to care anymore about making your photography tile, B2M takes care of it for you. You can chose between 2 modes of tiling: offset or splat.<br/><br/><strong>GENERATE THE METALLIC MAP</strong><br/><br/>Easily obtain a metallic map from the image using simple tools, or an input mask. This feature is essential when working in PBR.<br/><br/><strong>FULL CONTROL OVER MICROSURFACE</strong><br/><br/>Control and adjust the finest details of your material thanks to the comprehensive set of parameters exposed by B2M. This includes adjusting the generated roughness map, for PBR.<br/><br/><strong>SHAPE RECOGNITION</strong><br/><br/>Bitmap2Material is the only map extractor which can keep the original shapes of your picture among all your maps.<br/><br/><strong>GRUNGE MAPS</strong><br/><br/>Change the look&amp;amp;feel of your material with one of the 15 embedded grunge maps, or use one of your own.<br/><br/><strong>AN INFINITY OF VARIATIONS</strong><br/><br/>B2M offers the unique ability to randomize your material and produce infinite variations with a single click!<br/><br/>Pro version only:<br/>Use Bitmap2Material directly in your modeling tool or game engine in real time*!
