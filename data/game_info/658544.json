It\u2019s a remix of the base story and even though the characters are counterparts/based off of the ones you are familiar with, should not be expected to stick with said canon.<br/><br/>Friday Night Funkin\u2019 Soft takes the basic reskin formula and turns it on it\u2019s head. Its a new way to enjoy a beloved rhythm game with a focus on story telling, character design, and creativity. Prepare to fall back in love with the original crew and meet new faces in a world where everything looks so innocent or... at least that\u2019s what it would seem. Follow Soft BF as he attempts to follow his dreams of becoming a painter with his lover Soft Pico by his side. So cute and gentle. It all seems too good to be true...<br/><br/>- 6 Chapters.<br/>- Completely original story unlike any mod has ever done.<br/>- 16 Song OST (12 playable songs and 4 menu songs)<br/>- All characters reimagined.<br/>- All backgrounds redone.<br/>- Expressive dialogue portraits (130+)<br/>- And so much more!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T08:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b4/9b429294a8e79ac91245e29cc5e631a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LuckyGuy_17"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
