So there is not much art and just a couple of sounds, but I had fun working on it and hope some of you have fun playing it :)</p>\n<p>You have in a duelling tournament, and have to survive as many rounds as possible.</p>\n<p>You have the ability to buy upgrades and more important ammo before each new round, you are also allowed to choose your opponent, so choose wisely.</p>\n<p>After selecting your opponent the round will start, press SPACE to start the countdown and SPACE again to draw you weapon and countdown is over. Your character will aim up and down automatically and you have to press SPACE to shoot.</p>\n<p>Kill your opponent before they kill you, but remember you have a limited amount of ammo. If you and your opponent runs out of ammo the round will end in a draw, and you will get a free bullet.</p>\n<p><strong>Programs used:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Unity 2019.3</li><li>Visual Studio</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Paint.net</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Assets/Add-ons</strong></p>\n<ul><li>DoTween</li><li>WolframTones</li><li>Responsive WebGL Template</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:13:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703c9a064131a60a754c63da3158b02b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZenriS"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
