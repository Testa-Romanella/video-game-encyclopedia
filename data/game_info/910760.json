(yumna_m)", "description": "<p><em>\"Pop It!\" is a 2D game in which you must pop bubbles in a side-scrolling game world\u00a0before the time runs out. Although the core concept is the same in all levels (popping bubbles in a limited period of time), each has its own distinct surroundings, difficulties, and pleasure. You, as a player, must be wary of the obstacles that stand in your way of enjoying your favorite pastime of bursting bubbles.</em></p>\n\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>Use the right and left arrow keys to move right and left</p>\n<p>Use the space bar to jump</p>\n<p>The game can be paused using the \"p\" key</p>\n\n<p>IMPORTANT:</p>\n<p>The quit button does not work in the online version, yet it does in the PC version. This is due to the fact that while utilizing a WebGL file, it is not feasible to close the window.<br/></p>\n<p>You may also hear a \"click\" sound when you hit the space bar.\u00a0Yes! It was not intentional; it is again caused by the WebGL file format, which works well with the PC version.</p>\n\n<p>NOTICE:</p>\n<p>The game is developed for educational purposes.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T12:53:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e91/e91f10e764a0d159c1996cc7274c58d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yumna_m"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
