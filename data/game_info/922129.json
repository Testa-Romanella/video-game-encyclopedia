You play as<strong> Unamed Character </strong>and use your heart to traverse the levels. I really wanted to make more\u00a0 for this one, I feel like what little narrative there is was rushed a bit. I'm still extremely proud of it though. This game is my fourth, and, marks 6 months of game dev progress and Gdevelop usage. I hope you'll enjoy it.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<p>It's not stated, but, when you're a little red heart, you can move with WASD.</p>\n<p>Jumping while on the corner of the ground may cause you to use your double jump, there may also be some minor issues with the audio.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play on Liluo.io<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T03:57:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e4/0e484b9d70ad3f53eccd4002ed59bded.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["NUTT"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
