The goal is to give insight into how millions of innocent\u00a0civilians' lives were affected by the genocidal invasion of russia using an experimental storytelling method focused on subjective perceptions of the world.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You are Nadiya (\"Hope\"), a 14-year-old girl from the Ukrainian city\u00a0Mariupol with a passion for film photography. Due to the trauma of\u00a0your life being destroyed by the 2022 invasion, you use your camera's viewfinder to see the beauty of your home prior to the war. When taking the actual photo, however, the harsh reality can be seen in the picture. Your mind severely clouds and distorts your\u00a0vision as you walk the broken streets you grew up in, so you must rely on your ability to view the world clearly through your camera in order to recognize familiar spots that have become nothing but rubble. Your goal is to escape Mariupol and document its tragedies in foreign lands, inform them of the pains, and hopefully motivate the world to come to Ukraine's aid. But beware! Not only do you have a limited number of photos you can take throughout your journey, but you must also avoid getting spotted and caught by the monstrous soldiers patrolling the streets. You will have to find ways to avoid the enemy by hiding and sneaking around them.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You can download and play the prototype which showcases the core mechanics in a rough\u00a0block-out of one of the levels.
