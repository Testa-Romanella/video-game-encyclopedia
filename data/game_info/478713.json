{"id": 478713, "slug": "snowtime", "name": "Snowtime!", "name_original": "Snowtime!", "description": "<p>You're a snowman with a magical clock that controls time. You can rewind and forward your own lifespan and control what state you're in.\u00a0Will you be a strong, large snowman, or the floaty evaporation cloud from your future life?</p>\n<p>This was made for Brackeys Game Jam 2020, with the theme being \"rewind!\" Woohoo! I started late and didn't finish, but I still had fun. This was the first game jam I've done alone, and the second game jam ever for me. It's quite buggy so read below in case you get stuck and need a quick fix.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy! :D<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Find the key and reach the goal at the end of each level.</li><li>Use the WASD keys to move.</li><li>Use SPACE to interact. This can mean something different or nothing at all\u00a0depending on what state your snowman is in!</li><li>Use Q to use your Clocks. Move the clock hand by clicking and dragging to choose a snowman state to be in.</li><li>Warning! You can only use your Clock 3 times, and your snowman cannot withstand fire or water.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The first snowman state can jump. Press and hold SPACE for higher jumps.\u00a0</li><li>The second and third snowman state can break certain objects within range.\u00a0</li><li>The fourth snowman state can move really fast.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known bugs/errors:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Buttons on some game over screens do not work. You'll have to refresh the page to restart. Sorry! :(</li><li>If you find yourself stuck on a platform, you'll have to try to wiggle yourself out. Mash the arrow keys a bit. If you're still stuck, you can restart the level by using up all your Clocks.</li><li>The Clock can put you in a state you didn't want. Make sure to place the\u00a0 clock hand around the\u00a0middle of the different colored panels, and not at the panels' edges.</li><li>The music doesn't play all the time. It's very pretty though. Please try to imagine it playing everywhere.\u00a0:)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:05:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ab/3aba5655d567a05fbd133668f81acd3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["april denise"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
