The theme of the game jam is \"Out of Control\".</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Ice Battle is a local two-player battle game with shitty control.</p>\n<p>Our\u00a0interpretation of the theme is that, it is really hard for player to control the character, and the it will be more and more difficult to control during the play.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal<br/></strong>The goal of this two-player battle game is apparently kill the other player. To achieve this goal, players should utilize the spike in the middle of the screen. Players could carry the spike, and shoot the spike towards the other player. After booting up for 30 seconds, there will be ice blocks popping out. There is actually no reason for the ice blocks to be in this version of the game, yet our artist made the brilliant explosion animation, so we just kept it.</p>\n<p>You are encouraged to shoot the other player using the spike. Once you fire it, the spike will move really fast along the direction. If it hit the other player without hitting any other object before, this will deal damage to the other player.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Control\" System &amp; Control</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You would notice that there is a value named \"control\" under your \"life\" in the UI. When dealing damage, it will firstly affect this value. When \"control\" becomes small, it would be more difficult for players to control their character. By the way, hitting the wall or the ice block would also deal a small amount of damage to the character.</p>\n<p>However, players would not directly lose one life after the \"control\" decreased to zero. If the \"control\" becomes zero and the player get another shot, it will lose one life.</p>\n<p>This idea is kind of inspired by Super Smash Bros.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Player 1</strong></p>\n<p>WS: move forward and backward</p>\n<p>AD: turn left and right</p>\n<p>E: shoot<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Player 2</strong><br/>Up and down: move forward and backward</p>\n<p>Left and right: turn left and right</p>\n<p>Right Shift: shoot</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p>Art: Gella &amp; Yanning</p>\n<p>Design &amp; Code: Dan &amp; Tiansing</p>\n<p>Music &amp; SFX: Kiro<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:18:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/943/943b83db01da9d83b089966348c8e1d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
