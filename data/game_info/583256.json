Also, the development of this game is super slow due to my financial problem and my hardware limitation. My laptop\u00a0was so freaking low specs. So I always experience a lot of\u00a0lags and struggle to make progress. Despite struggling to finish this game. I am doing all my best and hard work to deliver an extreme horror experience and make a living out of it. Any donation will extremely help me to make great progress developing this game and I really so much appreciate it a lot.\u00a0I hope you understand if the release date of this demo is months away.\u00a0Thank You!<br/><br/>STORY:\u00a0 You are playing as a teenager who wants to investigate and find out the truth about this mysterious abandoned asylum near your place.
