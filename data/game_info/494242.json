With her broom out and blaster charged, she's ready to step up to the plate and make her usual rounds around the galaxy, so that YOU get your pizza in 30 parsecs or under.</p>\n<p>Too bad that what she thought would be a normal night is turning out to be anything but. Someone has hexed her and hexed her good: now she's stuck in space with a finicky broom that needs to pick extra light just to stay ON, the occasional flashing curse that taunts her and turns her blasters OFF, and an ever increasing number of starving baddies eager to get their teeth and claws on the pies meant for her paying customers.</p>\n<p>\"Better ingredients, better...OH GOD A SPACE BUG!\" - Space Witch</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Game Objectives/Mechanics</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Run and gun!
