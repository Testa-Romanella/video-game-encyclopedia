The dotted line and arrow shows where your currently loaded rune will land. Using\u00a0the arrow keys, you can switch which column you wish the launch in. When you're ready, press the\u00a0space bar to fire.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are 3 types of Rune.\u00a0The <strong>Standard </strong>runes (which come in 5 different shapes) the <strong>Wildcard </strong>runes and the <strong>Detonator </strong>runes.</p>\n\n<p>\r\nWhen placed, <strong>Standard </strong>runes will convert adjacent <strong>Standard </strong>runes into those of the same shape.\u00a0\r\n<strong>Standard </strong>runes of the same shape form \"links\" that connect them to one another.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wildcard </strong>runes don't convert runes, but instead can form links with others regardless of type or shape. Use them to bridge links between different shapes of <strong>Standard </strong>rune!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Detonator </strong>rune is how you score points and remove runes from the stack. When it lands, any adjacent runes and any that they are linked to are destroyed.\u00a0To score big, use long links destroy as many runes as you can at once. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Every few turns, a new row of runes will be added to the stack.\u00a0If the stack ever reaches the striped area at the bottom of the screen, it's game over! When the stack begins to shake, that's your warning that a new row is coming soon.\u00a0\u00a0Once you've destroyed enough runes, the difficulty level will increase, giving you less turns between new rows being added to the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Before you launch, runes already in the stack will begin to glow. This gives you a preview of what effect your move will have on the stack. If you have a <strong>Standard </strong>or <strong>Wildcard </strong>rune loaded, the glow indicates which runes it will form links with. If you have a <strong>Detonator </strong>rune loaded, it indicates which runes will\u00a0be destroyed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The box in the bottom left shows you what runes are going to be loaded next. Make sure to plan ahead!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:13:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d44/d44e55146416c2ab562bad3b992dfa7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Disc 1"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
