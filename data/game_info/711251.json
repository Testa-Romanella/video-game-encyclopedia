Any Cait blown out the top half of the screeen will respawn in future waves, but those blown/moved out the bottom half will get past you. If too many Cait get past you, the game will end. Bottom right radar shows the current wave's incoming formation 1 screen away. Radar will help you preposition the fan and give time to strategize. The fan can only maintain operations for 300 seconds. Any Cait remaining after 300s will automatically get through (so don't blow it off...ha..ha.ha, ya).</p>\n<p><strong>\u25d8The FANkitty:</strong></p>\n<p>The fan can be moved back and forth in a circular orbit above the Earth. It can also speedboost to quickly reposition.</p>\n<p>The fan has two modes (ON/Turbo):\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. ON will slowly affect the closest object in its aoe. It is manually turned on/off, can be used while moving, and can be used with Turbo for even faster propulsion.</p>\n<p>2.Turbo will quickly affect the closest object in its aoe, but also any other objects in its aoe so long as they are within a certain range of the closest object. Turbo can only be used while stationary, holding both keys down.</p>\n<p>\u263b\u263b\u263b\u263b\u263aThe score to beat is 5/9. Goodluck! \u263a\u263b\u263b\u263b\u263b</p>\n<p>\u263b\u263b\u263aGame has a secret second mode/ending. Hint: be woke\u263a\u263b\u263b</p>\n<p><strong>\u25d8Just The Tips:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022Explosions trigger other explosions. And Turbo can ~move explosions.</p>\n<p>\u2022Blowing from behind enemies is underrated and worth exploring.</p>\n<p>\u2022Blowing Cait away, out of bounds along the\u00a0top-half of the screen, is better than letting them get through.</p>\n<p>\u2022Cait blown away will respawn in the last 50 seconds of the game. Any Cait blown away again will respawn faster and faster leading into the time-limit.</p>\n<p>\u2022Spend some time getting used to the controls. Tap controls will cover the slightest of human button taps, but get a fix on how long the tap actually lasts. 8/60s is the maximum length of time u can hold a key and have it count as a tap. Anything above 8/60s turns into a hold control. Speedboosts require care to avoid procing the fan on/off accidently.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Made in Pico8 for the two-button-game-jam:https://itch.io/jam/2-buttons-jam-2021</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed just two buttons you are sure to enjoy just one.
