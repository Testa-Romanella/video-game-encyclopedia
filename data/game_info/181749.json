I was kind of split on releasing this but hey why not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before you play please keep in mind that this is in no way a finished game, I gained a lot of experience\u00a0from this project and moved on.</p>\n<p>The reason I finally decided to upload this is because I feel that I need the closure of finally releasing it, even if it is quite unfinished. As if I\u00a0didn't it would just sit in its folder for eternity, never seeing the light of day. That feeling has been nibbling at me for the past couple of days.</p>\n<p>I learnt a lot from the project and incorporated many elements from it into my others that I\u00a0eventually uploaded here. The other games I have made, such as Graviton, Office, and The Asteroid Field are the main reasons why I abandoned this in the first place.</p>\n<p>It would also be a huge waste to not release this as my boy Joel W. worked on some pumping tunes for this game. Big thanks to him, please check out his other works, including his new masterpiece Hitspace.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Joel's Bandcamp:\u00a0https://silencerized.bandcamp.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>If, however, by some miracle people somehow enjoy this, I\u00a0may begin to work on it once more. If you find any bugs please inform me using the comments section below and\u00a0\u00a0I shall attempt to fix them.</p>\n<p>It would also be a huge waste to not release the game with Silencerized's soundtrack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d02/d023af3431031f70ca60205281ab8ed0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Pamps Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
