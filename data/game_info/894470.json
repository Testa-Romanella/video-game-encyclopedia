Egypt had reached its zenith of power and prosperity under the reign of Akhenaten, until foreigners came and stole all its wealth. Invaders wiped Egypt off the map in a few days and took Pharaoh Akhenaten's family away. <br/><br/>Akhenaten vowed to get them back. He felt that as a Pharaoh, he had the responsibility to protect his family and reign by all means necessary. He started using imprisonment, torture and agony as tools to track down the enemy. By time, he became cruel and insane, desperately wanting his family and throne back. His cruelty was so intense that he believed he became a god of agony, terrorizing innocent people to retrieve his losses. When he was not able to cope with this torment any more, he decided to kill himself with the last items he owned so that he could be revived when his family returned. His family never returned. At least this is what most people believe, but there are other theories about what really happened\u2026<br/>Some say Akhenaten was nothing but a true monster, and he himself brought death to his own family just to justify torturing and killing innocent people. He felt that he was above everyone else and therefore did whatever he wanted, which often resulted in unutterable terror. Nothing about him seemed normal, and everything about him screamed demon. Only survivors could tell the tale of what happened. The rest were dead.</p><h3>4 Survivors, 1 Pharaoh... What Now?</h3><br/>Four people entered the pyramid for different reasons. Some people came to make money and some came for professional reasons, but none expected what they would find inside. As soon as they entered the pyramid they started feeling distressed. The temperature dropped and it became harder to breath. They looked around but there was nothing unusual\u2014just a dark corridor leading deeper into the pyramid.   They followed it without hesitation despite their growing unease until one of them made a critical move without asking others, triggering a series of events. They suddenly found themselves separated from one another. There is no map or guidebook\u2014just an ancient structure with no light except for what comes from their own flashlights or torches! They were supposed to be working together, but they're all separated now and they can't find their way back. They are in danger and they have no idea how to get out of this situation. What is the curse? No one knows! The way to escape is unclear. The only certainty is that they are all trapped inside, and the darkness within seems to be growing.<br/><br/>The pyramid had been built by Akhenaten before he committed atrocities for mysterious reasons, and has been sealed for thousands of years. There have been rumors about a treasure chest full of gold and jewels in the pyramid, and an evil curse protecting it. Unbeknown to the intruders, it's also home to a mummy, Akhenaten, who had been asleep for a very long time. He is now furious that intruders have found his resting place and that his home has been violated. The intruders will pay!<h3>The Most Terrifying Multiplayer Game Ever!</h3><br/>The game is simple; survive or die!
