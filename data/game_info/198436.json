In this game you drive a tractor that's towing a flying trailer to collect cans of beans and return them to your spaceship.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>When a can is collected it is thrown into your trailer where it will roll around in the back, it's up to you whether you want to play it safe and only carry a few cans at a time or you can stuff your trailer full of cans and risk them falling out. (If they fall out they return to the spot they were picked up at).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game has three levels but more will be added in the future. Each level has the option of playing it in easy, normal, or hard mode; the difference between these modes is that it increases the amount of cans required to get home and the amount of police out on the streets.</p>\n<p>Don't try to find the edge of the world or something bad may happen...\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e1/5e1ff707fe22e464d4f294153767ef84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["kristiandixon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
