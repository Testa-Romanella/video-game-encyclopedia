Can you escape the shrieking death?</p>\n<p>You befriended a vampire but it became unstable and now wants to bite you, and bought friends too, what a suprise. If only you had a bow and an arrow.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the image is bigger than the game itself, just play it. All devices with keyboard (physical or virtual) can run this game.\u00a0 Mobile friendly, feel free to try it right now. Thanks for checking it out.</p>\n<p>Couldn't have done it without past ludum dare games like that of mitato, my thanks to the community.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T05:11:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/686/6862b35d38884ffac1e80d09f3a3b66d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dobryncat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
