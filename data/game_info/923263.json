You are a magic creature created by an evil wizard and trapped in his castle. Your goal is to solve puzzles and eventually escape the castle. To do this, you have to master leveraging the wizard's magic orb, that has the ability to switch between worlds, making objects appear and disappear. The orb follows you, but can also be laid down and resummoned. You can also deactivate the orb.\u00a0 There are 6 levels in total, namely Laboratory, Library, Garden, Church, Catacombs and Kitchen. Some of them contain guards trying to capture you. On your way you can collect up to 18 shinies. Each level features its own unique soundtrack composed by Christian Kohler from the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater M\u00fcnchen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T06:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/800/800a38f5eac1e4fcb77a6efe333f9a5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michl Bayer", "Daki21", "24h7d4w", "vyno", "Murasaki", "grince"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
