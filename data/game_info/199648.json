Choose your deck and place power-ups on the race track. After that try to beat your opponent in a race.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>2 LOCAL PLAYERS ONLY</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Player 1 - WASD</p>\n<p>Player 2 - Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Made using: GameMaker: Studio, GIMP 2</p>\n\n<p><strong>!! WARNING !!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sadly, I didn\u2019t make it in time. Game is missing one of the most important features - Working power-ups. You can still place them, but they\u2019re not even coded to do anything. The game was intended to be much bigger than it is now, but I encountered many, many unexpected problems and had to cut half of the game. Originally, you had only 5 cards in the first turn. You could get another 2 in next 2 turns. I also planned more cards, including ones affecting the enemy\u2019s deck.</p>\n<p>It's still playable though. And a working, bigger, better version is in development...<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c70/c703811f28cb90db544c12246d859d6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emki"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
