Find the download link below.\r\n\r\nThink you're good at multi-tasking? Put it to the test!\u00a0\r\n<p>Navigate multiple suburban race tracks, and complete multiple challenges without scratching your new ride.</p>\n<p>You play as a teenager who just received their first car as a gift from their mom. It isn't perfect, but it's yours and your key to adulthood! The only problem:\u00a0You are\u00a0<em>very\u00a0</em>easily distracted, and you're not the best driver either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Protect your new ride as you traverse 10 levels across the suburban sprawl, while dealing with distractions that block your view! Protect your new car at all costs, or your parents are totally going to kill you.</p>\r\nTeachers:\u00a0\r\n<p>Included separately is a guidebook to allow you to incorporate this game into your classroom! Teach your students the dangers of distracted driving in a way they can experience, rather than through a lecture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guidebook will provide research and sources, an IT guide, and\u00a0suggested talking points to allow you to stimulate conversation and provide context through game-based learning. The game itself is absolutely free and is playable in-browser, so the cost of the guidebook is just for the educational materials to make incorporating the game into your classroom quick and easy!</p>\n\r\nThis game is free to play, but please consider donating!\u00a0\r\n\n<p><strong>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\r\nSteer Left/Right\r\n<p>Left &amp; Right Arrow\u00a0<em>|</em>\u00a0\"A\" &amp; \"D\"</p>\r\nAccelerate\r\n<p>Up Arrow\u00a0<em>|\u00a0</em>\"W\"</p>\r\nPause\r\n<p>Space Bar</p>\r\nToggle Full\u00a0Screen\r\n<p>F1\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Windows version only)</p>\r\nQuit Game\r\n<p>Esc</p>\n<p>(Windows version only)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong><br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><em>Art and Programming:\u00a0</em>Heather Clark -\u00a0@DeprecatGames</p>\n<p><em>Music:\u00a0</em>Komiku -\u00a0http://loyaltyfreakmusic.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/630/6303536c580867f981100730de3d2f19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Deprecat"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Racing", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
