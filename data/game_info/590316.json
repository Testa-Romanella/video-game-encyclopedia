Thousands of students\u00a0have wasted incalculable aggregate hours of invaluable class time playing this game\u00a0instead of doing math. And now so can you, without needing to acquire a special\u00a0device to do it. Who says there's no such thing as progress?</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to access the lock/exit of each level by moving the\u00a0character of the game, named BlockBot. To accomplish this, you will need to\u00a0cleverly move blocks about within the level to provide a navigable path to\u00a0the level exit. On a console computer, use the arrow keys to move, the space bar to take and drop, and the escape key to undo moves.\u00a0 On mobile, use arrow buttons to move, asterisk to take and drop, and menu option to undo moves.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:07:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6a/c6a9a907fce2adbe47bd5d2f72c5b13f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["horan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
