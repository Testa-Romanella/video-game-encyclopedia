As his words traveled throughout the crowd , he already knew that this was indeed a BIG mistake. The Tiki God was angry, very angry. I mean really really angry like flowing lava is going to burn down your village angry. But that still doesn&amp;#39;t describe it well... more like flying burning meteors are going to smash you all ANGRY. <br/><br/>Something had to be done, the elders have decided. YOU will try and appease the angry God. Yes, yes.. we know we&amp;#39;ve already tried that and he burned everyone before you, but they just didn&amp;#39;t treat his totem with care and respect and probably mixed the blocks in the wrong order... NOW GO and save us or we&amp;#39;re all going to burn.<br/><br/>\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d<br/>USEFUL LINKS<br/><br/>Spokko website\u2028http://www.spokko.com/<br/>TouchArcade discussion\u2028<br/>http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=32405", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/818/81877f8df30101828215c02178604a37.jpeg", "website": "http://www.spokko.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Rafal Staszewski"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Rafal Staszewski"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
