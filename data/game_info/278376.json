Very much a trainwreck; in that grand tradition that makes use of Clickteam sprites.\r\n</p>\n<p>My home town is being overrun by those blasted superheroes. Get rid of as many of them as you can before they tire you out. Run around with WASD. The bigger they get the more damage they do when you finish 'em off.</p>\n<p>Uploaded to Glorious Trainwrecks and also put up on itch.io as well in case you'd rather play it in a browser. But I think the download version runs a bit more smoothly.</p>\n<p>Music by Monplaisir from www.freemusicarchive.org<br/>Superhero sprites by Copper from a long defunct, now archived website.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8badafc0631c14add57de885df3c4b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fizzhog"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
