{"id": 236169, "slug": "numball", "name": "Numball", "name_original": "Numball", "description": "The idea of this game is very simple. There is a series of numbered balls that move and bounce along the screen. Their numbers are calculated based on arithmetic equations chosen by the player. The goal is to go through the right ball in the correct order, avoiding contact with other balls. To do this, place your finger on a point on the screen and move it looking for the right option without touching the rest.<br/><br/>To win a game you will need to have quick reflexes and be good at mental arithmetic. If you want more emotions, try to limit the available time and fight against chrono too.<br/><br/>The app allows you to configure aspects such as the number of balls on screen, the maximum number of errors that can occur, the time limit, the mathematical function to be working with and the language. If the user chooses a function such as \u201cf(x) = ax + b\u201d , a and b terms are randomly generated, so each new game will change the calculations to be performed.<br/><br/>It can be very good for children. If simple functions are chosen, they can develop their ability to calculate fastly. They could for example, practice the multiplication tables in a fun way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/942061aac1b96247306c6ce23deecd68_9hpzNoi.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["AUTODEF"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["rosa mateos"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
