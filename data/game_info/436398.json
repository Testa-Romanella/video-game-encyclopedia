Therefore it's\u00a0necessary, through the thread of the life of this character, and through various indices, to reconstruct the missing memories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The metaphor of coma, that we stage as metanoia, is in order to make the character realize that his forgetfulness was\u00a0the problem and that it is by changing that he can get out of this state of coma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MOVING AROUND</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>TO PICK AN ITEM<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>MOVE CAMERA\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>ROUDOT Mattias</p>\n<p>OLIVEIRA Daniel</p>\n<p>EGIDO Enriqu\u00e9\u00a0</p>\n<p>ABBRAHAM Yann</p>\n<p>KAPP Margaux</p>\n<p>PHAM Linh</p>\n<p>BARNEOUD Bastien</p>\n<p>GOMBAULD Lo\u00efck</p>\n\n<p>CUCAL\u00d3N Lola</p>\n<p>PHILIPPOT Augustin</p>\n<p>BELDI Nada</p>\n<p>CLEMENT Chana</p>\n<p>MAUMEN\u00c9 Juliette\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T02:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94d/94d4c7f52c09d63b4acecb668f8823c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enrique Egido", "wildegom", "SkovZorus Rex", "Linhcorne", "Kolphis", "MissFryzz", "Danisho", "juliette_mmn", "Nada Beldi", "Lolacucalon", "Brawh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
