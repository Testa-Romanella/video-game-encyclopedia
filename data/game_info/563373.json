Crates can be used to cross water or to trigger buttons or to reach higher places. In some instances, you have to think smart to utilize a crate. The player and crates can make use of a lift-block that takes you to a higher place in the level. <br/><br/>The game is fully 3D so the camera can be rotated in both directions. Don\u2019t worry you can\u2019t die in this game and if you make a wrong move you can undo every wrong turn. After reaching the goal you can see how well you did compare to others in the leaderboard and see if you can complete a level with fewer moves.<br/><br/>.<br/><strong>Use the block lift to go higher!</strong><br/><br/>.<br/><strong>Push different kinds of blocks!</strong><br/><br/>.<br/><strong>Activate triggers to your advantage!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T03:40:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eeb/eeb844d00754d653c07dc7d1c11e34e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NanningsGames"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["NanningsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
