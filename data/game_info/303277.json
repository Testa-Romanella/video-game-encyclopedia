You, one of Van Gato\u2019s distant relatives, must face the highest tree in the land to revive his legacy and return the world to its former glory.<br/></p>\n<p>On the way up, you will be able to collect all four pieces to his work Starry Night, and if you want you may also collect and restore three colors that have gone missing. If you venture too far, the trees are not so forgiving\u2026 plan your jumps carefully and you\u2019ll climb high.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Van Gato is structured as a vertical platformer, where the player\u2019s goal is to reach the top of the tree after gathering all collectables. There are four pieces to the Starry Night painting, and three paint brushes, spread throughout the level. As the player collects each object, the HUD will update. If they collect a paint brush, the player will find the color reflected in the background as well as the painting once fully gathered. Gathering all 4 painting pieces are required to complete the game, while the colors are optional. </p>\n<p>The player will use their jump to navigate the platforms after strategically positioning themselves. Some types branches allow for clipping, while others will stop their jump. If the player falls off a branch they will slowly descend, allowing them to recover. However, if the player misses the branch completely they will find themselves plummeting to the ground at a much faster rate. </p>\n\r\nMovement\r\n<p>The player can use the left and right arrow keys to position themselves within the level. To climb the tree, the player must use the \u201cx\u201d key to jump. </p>\n<p>NOTE: The jump has a fixed arc every time it is used- it never changes. The arc and sprites are designed to mimic a cat\u2019s leap.</p>\n<p>----------------</p>\n<p>Time frame: ~ 1 month</p>\n<p><strong>Our Team:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sydnee Rodriguez\u00a0</li><li>Jonathan Hopkins</li><li>Angela Diep</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/686/6861d2b7ea3c50b98a51c49207d4b5d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sydnee-rodriguez"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
