Valuable mineral resources \u2014 gold, silver and copper \u2014 have been found in the 1,200 km long desert in Chile and Peru along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Several companies are already busy prospecting by erecting huge drilling rigs as the resources are deep under the surface. Due to security reasons, the drilling rigs cannot be installed too close to one another, so each new rig limits the possibilities for erecting new ones in the surrounding areas.<br/><br/>What\u2019s more, the mining rights have been limited by the government. The companies have received a concession for only two of the three commodities \u2013 and extracting the \u201cwrong\u201d type of commodity will result in penalties.
