{"id": 599457, "slug": "tetragun", "name": "TETRAGUN (itch)", "name_original": "TETRAGUN (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>TETRAGUN</strong></p>\n<p>Tetragun is a top-down shooter where you play as a stationary turret and defend yourself against waves of enemies. As you progress through the waves, you will acquire upgrades to help you keep up with the growing strength and numbers of your enemies. The arena is split into 4 quadrants, and your turret will only be able to aim within the confines of the quadrant it is currently in. To aim at enemies outside of your current quadrant, you'll need to enter rotate mode with <strong>RMB</strong> and click on the quadrant you would like to rotate to. The goal of the game is to make it as far as possible, and get the highest score you can.</p>\n\n<p>This game is very early in development and you will notice that a ton of features are currently missing that are typically present in most games,\u00a0 like a fully functional main menu (most buttons on the main menu do not work yet because their respective features are not yet implemented). I can assure you that we are hard work and making sure that theses features get the attention they deserve so that when they do arrive, they are great! Any updates will be posted here, and free to download until the final release. The current build is mainly a test build to get feedback about the overall concept of the game, and to hear any suggestions you may have. We are looking forward to hearing what you think!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[LEFT CLICK (LMB)] </strong>- Fire/Select.</p>\n<p><strong>[RIGHT CLICK (RMB)] </strong>- Enter rotate mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Configurable controls will be available in the full version.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PLANNED FEATURES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ENEMY UPGRADES\u00a0</strong>- Each wave, enemies will receive random mods similar to how the player currently does, which will add to the randomized nature of the game and make each run more varied and exciting.</p>\n<p><strong>LEADERBOARDS\u00a0</strong>- Online leaderboards will be available, which will allow players to compete with their friends for highscores. The leaderboards will also display the player and enemy mods that the players had in each entry.</p>\n<p><strong>TURRET VARIANTS\u00a0</strong>- Unlockable turret variants will be available and each will have unique stats and abilities to go along with them.</p>\n<p><strong>THE COLLECTION</strong> - In the collection, you will be able to view all of the mods you've discovered while playing, and see how many mods you have yet to discover!</p>\n<p><strong>CUSTOM SOUNDTRACK\u00a0</strong>- We are currently working with a talented university student who is pursuing a music degree to create a bumpin' soundtrack for Tetragun (The current music is a placeholder).</p>\n<p><strong>MORE\u00a0</strong>- There are a ton of ideas we have for the game but as of right now, we are trying to remain focused on the core features listed above before anything else. Currently there are only 4 player mods (3 tiers each)\u00a0in the game but many more are planned, and there will be at least 20 at release.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Any and all donations are extremely appreciated and very encouraging, but only donate if are financially able and\u00a0you enjoyed the game! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T06:37:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/123/1233b07d7fa330a2f6fd06ac50ee5971.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greeb Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
