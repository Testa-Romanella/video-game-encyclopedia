My goal for improving on traditional credits screens was to make it more engaging. When I see credits I feel conflicted, because I'm bored and don't want to watch a bunch of names that don't mean anything to me, but if I've played a game long enough to get to a credits screen I probably liked it a lot.</p>\n<p>But if you could set the credits in the same mechanics as the game, so you didn't really \"beat\" the game unless you beat the credits too, and in the process you have to focus on the creators names and learn more about them during the credits\u00a0then you'd be way more invested in the creators of the game and not just the game itself. Maybe you'd even be inspired to follow them to see what else they've done and what they do next.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have a game I want to make with the working title Untitled Mystery Game, and the mechanics will be similar to the mechanics in this credits sequence, so it works as a small early prototype for the game as well. This is a very quick look at what the credits could be.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T05:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33e/33e248b59b1bdbf1d2fdfc34de7b44d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["illuminatedspace"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
