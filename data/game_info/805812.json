Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move the duck around and collect bread. But if you get pooed on the game is over!</p>\n<p>//Unfortunately, on conversion to WebGL build (or import/export of scene), some assets and scripting have been removed and the view is more zoomed in that it should be - fullscreen mostly fixes this. These are fixed in the Windows version which is attached.</p>\n<p>//I previously fixed the issue of the duck spinning on the spot by increasing angular drag, however, I undid this because it seems quite comical.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T18:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a71ed81502247668c7cac0d8dbdedc79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PurpleBabyGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
