The left button moves left, right moves right. If a red warning sign appears at the top of the screen, it means a road hazard is coming. Players should navigate the vehicle out of the way of the Hazard. If the Hazard hits the front of the vehicle, it will damage the engine If the hazard hits the left or right treads it will damage the respective one. If a yellow arrow appears at the top of the screen, it means scrap is coming down. Players should navigate to have the scrap hit the plow at the front of the vehicle, scrap will then collect inside the green bin at the front. Players can walk over this scrap to pick it up. Players can take the scrap to the tread or engine terminals to repair them. Each terminal has 3 states, functioning, breaking (smoke particles), failing (Fire particles), or broken (smoke and fire particles). If these components are damaged then their effectiveness is lowered. The treads impact left and right movement speed and the engine determines forward speed. Try to get as far as possible without letting two vehicle components break!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:43:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/287/2870ae3cde09dfd05bb52009971f80e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jared"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
