The game functions through several components: the movement, combat and Hellbent state. There are two \u201cmodes\u201d of movement, one where the player can move normally at a set pace using arrow/WASD keys and another through the dash mechanic which is a sped-up increased lunge in a specific direction. This movement mechanic can be used for travelling or more usefully, dodging and kiting enemy attacks/harmful projectiles. Players will be faced off against monsters and enemies in a stage/floor model in which the main goal of the game is to clear each room of enemies and progress to the next room, inevitably clearing the entire floor, however they must do this while balancing a self-destructive state of being, the Hellbent state. The Hellbent state functions as a high risk, high reward ability/state and can be entered once the Hellbent bar reaches 100% through killing enemies. This state gives the player a fun and high risk experience where their damage will be buffed and they gain lifesteal\u00a0while the cons will be a continuous\u00a0loss of health and increased vulnerability when taking damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Development Team:</strong></p>\n<p>Oscar San - Director, Programmer, Art Design, Sound Design\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yannik Brunzema - Programmer, Art Design</p>\n<p>Jeff Li - Art Design,\u00a0Sound Design, Music Composer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T17:47:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35ced67376bfc46577a6f5f71d4ff2f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oscoSan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
