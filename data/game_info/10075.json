It follows Dovetail Games annual game release model.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>There is no plot present in the game. The players participate in different singleplayer scenarios that are either preset by the developers or created by the community. The game also features a so-called free roam mode, where the players can choose whichever train they would like to use, attach carts of different types and explore the in-game world. </p>\n<p>The game&#39;s train routes resemble the real ones that can be found in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and the United States. </p>\n<p>The players handle all the aspect of the train on its route by walking in the cabin of the driving cart in a first-person view. The game features a realistic graphics and physics model. It is possible to pull all the levers, push all the buttons in a heavily detailed driving cart of any train. All the cargo and the passengers are detailed and animated by hand resulting in a substantial degree of realism. The game also features a dynamic weather system which drastically affects the gameplay. For example, a heavy storm can drive an old steam locomotive off the tracks.</p>\n<p>Multiple train types are present in the game, from the 19th century steam-powered trains to the most advanced modern magnetical levitation locomotives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T20:12:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8a231fb194a781ef2228505b1c1f0fb.jpg", "website": "http://www.train-simulator.com", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 54, "owned": 1208, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 37, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 1325, "ratings_count": 68, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dovetail Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Dovetail Games", "Dovetail Games - Trains"], "esrb_rating": null}
