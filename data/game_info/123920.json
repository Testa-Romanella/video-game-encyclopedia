As the games progresses the player will have to come up with different ideas of combining multiple actions to keys in order to solve the puzzles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Platforms and specs</strong></p>\n<p>The game has been tested on Windows 10 64-bit, but expected to work on Windows Vista and up, 32 bits.</p>\n<p>I suggest that you have an okay graphics card to play the game, but since it is not action oriented, you will probably have a good time even if playing the game with bad performance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>A game by Daniel Zaidan -\u00a0http://tdzgames.com/<br/>Sound effects created using JFXR<br/>Music created using Otomata<br/>Font: Blanka by Emmaran Richard -\u00a0https://www.behance.net/gallery/15451401/BLANKA-Free-font</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!</p>\n<p>Please, let me know what you think. ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/543/543b988f45606e952a5c016935e77f94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanZaidan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
