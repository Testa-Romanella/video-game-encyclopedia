You can collect Power Ups, you can jump and run the crap out of the game, if you want. You can collect mutations, wich work as passive abilities.</p>\n<p>The game itself is alive and trys it's best to keep you from playing it, because it is ashamed about the enemy-less gameplay. Maybe, the enemies are switched with short puzzles? Who knows...</p>\n<p>I tried my best to create nice music for my game. I created something very viby with a nice 80's-touch.</p>\n<p>I am 17 and this is the second \"complete\" game i've created. It's not really complete, because all the mechanics are working, i also got some more mechanics, but i am not able to put more time into Level-building than i did.<br/>I decided to finish up the levels and to use another idea i had in the beginning of the Jam: The invisible-mode. Everything visible gets invisible and everything invisible get's visible. I added this visibility-switched-levels as 'bonus' levels behind the last level.</p>\n<p>If you want, you can try to beat my highscores:426 turns, if you include the 'Bonus-levels' and 138 turns without them.!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/00641946201ca00bc16506f9439e3572.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["bluewingtitans"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
