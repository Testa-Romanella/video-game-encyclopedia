Based on the futuristic theme, I wanted to use these cyberpunk assets I've bought from Craftpix a while ago and I wanted it to be multiplayer.</p>\n<p>I'm using player.io for networking and Unity as my game engine. Originally I wanted this to be a competitive multiplayer, but due to time and knowledge constraints, it turned out to be a simple \"kill enemies and get out\" kind of game. It is what it is, but I do hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Player.io was being a pain and not connecting via webGL, so I had to stick with the standalone client. If there's one thing I learned is that decently-featured\u00a0multiplayer games with nice interpolated position syncing and depth cannot be made in a week, at least not by me :^).\u00a0Plus, who knows how well this will work under load!</p><p>If you are having game issues, try leaving your current game and joining/creating a new one or restarting the client!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:36:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/827/82766f6196857a31a31b612004e1486e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gooby"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
