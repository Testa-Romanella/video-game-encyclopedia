{"id": 609352, "slug": "2048-for-fairchild-channel-f", "name": "2048 for Fairchild Channel F", "name_original": "2048 for Fairchild Channel F", "description": "<p>A game for the Fairchild Channel F, written in F8 assembly language over the course of around 24 hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the classic modern-day mobile puzzle game 2048. The aim is to create a block containing the number 2048. When you move the controls in a direction, the blocks will move in that direction until they hit another block or the edge of the grid.</p>\n<p>When a moving block meets a stationary block of\u00a0the same value, they combine to create a block with double the value, which clears space on the grid.</p>\n\n<p>Every time you make a move a new block is randomly placed on the grid, usually this will be a 2 but sometimes can be a 4. Should the grid fill up and there are no adjacent blocks of the same value to combine, the game is over and you will need to press the reset button.<br/></p>\r\nGame Modes\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>2048 - the game finishes when you achieve a block with a value of 2048. Try and achieve this in the quickest time possible!</li><li>Long - the game continues until you create the largest block possible of 131,072 or there are no more moves available.</li><li>Time - you have three minutes to achieve the highest score you can.</li></ul>\n<p>Game modes are selected based on which button you press on the title screen.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>How To Run</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The .bin file can be played in MAME or MESS, you will probably\u00a0need to locate the\u00a0sl31253.rom/sl90025.rom and sl31254.rom BIOS files in order to successfully play Channel F games. I can't distribute these with the game but they are easily found on Google.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This online emulator can also be used, as above you'll need to provide the BIOS roms.\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=34262</p>\n<p>From the command line:\r\n</p>\n<p>mess channelf -cart C:\\tents.rom -w -r 720x720 -nodebug\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T07:38:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b1/3b14f88f7992187f258727aead66b962.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
