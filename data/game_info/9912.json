At the end of 1994 you became a warden of The Pompeii prison which locates in BlackCloud district. As the warden of a private prison, your responsiblities include making plans about the whole prison and solving all kinds of inmates' problems, such as power supply, waste disposal, food and water and accommodation for the prisoners. Of course, prisoners are concerned about these problems. If the warden doesn't provide relaxing facilities, some prisoners may not focus on their work or even cause terrile consequence such as riots, jailbreak or suicide.<br/><strong>Build different kinds of workshops to keep your prisoners working hard and earning money from the market.</strong>          You could make nearly 100 different goods from workshops which include drugs, Gatlin or even RPG. There are six main workshops (clothing, furniture, electric equipment, handcrafts, chemicals and firearms). You can sell those goods at the market and of course clothes and weapons are available for use.<strong>Find the specially skilled prisoners from the government and police database, and make those people work in your prison.</strong>          These professional criminals such as thieves, robbers, hackers, killers, bomber and fighters can undertake some \"special missions\" for you. Those special tasks include breaking into a bank vault, robbing a jewelry store, kidnapping &amp; blackmailing some wealthy merchants. Tailors, carpenters, technicians, chemistry professors and artists can work in different workshops and you can have them made valueable goods from raw materials.<br/>          Lawyers, bookkeeper, actors, former police officers, singers, chef and some \u201ctalents\u201d can work in your prison as an advisor. They can have negative influences on your prison.<br/><br/>Work as the warden to unlock the different projects. Time your selling at right time at the market. Make more money to expand your prison empire. And use money to influence politicians and gangs in the city.          The warden can increase the skill points by developing daily work.  Eventually, these can be used to unlock a new project which could be useful to your prison and allow you to make more money.<br/><br/>          Prices of goods and materials will change every day. As a warden, you need to find the best moment to buy the materials with the lowest price and sell the goods with most profit.<br/><br/>          There are also many gangs and criminal organizations in Crist City who will come to you to seek cooperation, trade and even help. When you make friend with some gangs, they may sell you some rare materials or even help you at important time. Obviously, there will be street gunfight between the gangs, some gangs may be eliminated by others. It requires you to make balance between various gangs, to avoid one gang dominating the city streets.
