This project was given to us by our client\u00a0Iain Percy who wanted to make an educational game for young children (4-7-year-olds\u00a0and for both male and female players) that delivers a green environmental message, presented in an offbeat fun way. The idea was to connect the game with pre-made characters that Iain had made and used in his\u00a0book, a short animation, and a set of toys: our job was to make a game based on them and expand the story and message!<br/><br/>The game is for Android - the idea is you can swipe on the touch screen, and you collect pies and chicken legs:\u00a0our main character, Bubba can eat any leftovers denoting the environmental problem we humans have with throwing edible\u00a0food and food leftovers/organic material that could be used for compost or used in other ways to harm our environment less.<br/><br/>The idea was for the game to explore all the Boingos character, we had developed plans how they would work but not enough development time was left to showcase it here.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T14:40:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db8084370e5f342e1136a5f9b03f5124.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Martin Georgiev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
