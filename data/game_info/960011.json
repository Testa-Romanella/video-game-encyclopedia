Oh yes! In Ship Graveyard Simulator 2: Prologue you will need a special crane and a large container for it. In the Prologue, you will have large fragments, modules and wreck components available for demolition, including engines, pumps, and control panels, but remember that the prologue has limited time! So make sure you will get the most valuable items!<br/><br/><br/><h3>HUGE SHIPS</h3>In the prologue of the game you can order only 5 new ships, that are waiting for demolition, and with the new ship, you will receive a new task! Even a small part has its own value.<br/><br/><br/><h3>DESTRUCTION</h3>Your main task in the prologue of the game is to dismantle ships into small parts, but remember you will have only 10 working in-game days to do that, so be ready for hard work! Use the available tools - hammer, saw, torch - to disassemble individual pieces of the ship into smaller pieces, collect as many of them as possible!<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-27T11:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e8/7e8b9586c87eb780b9e1835bfd2d236c.jpg", "website": "https://games-i.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 44, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 468, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games Incubator"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay", "Games Incubator"], "esrb_rating": null}
