{"id": 964955, "slug": "standbox", "name": "STANDBOX", "name_original": "STANDBOX", "description": "<strong>STANDBOX</strong> is about that urge that you might have had as a kid, when you were more interested about the tech-demo than the game advertised. It's an interactive sandbox where you get to bully a smart ragdoll. He can stand, tries to balance himself up, fall and get back-up, and is animated by an approximation of a medical system that includes organs.<br/><br/>You can damage him or play with him, throw him around and more.<h3>What is this game?</h3>The game is built like small-scope sandbox experimentation tool, inspired by video-game tech demos, centered around experimenting the behaviors of Stanley. Stanley can get balance, receive damage, suffer from concussions and brain damage, break bones, try to get back up (and fail if damaged enough), pass-out from bloodloss... There are 3 maps, and a few tools.<h3>What is planned for the future of the game?</h3>I have more ideas for STANDBOX and I hope I can make them happen for the game. That being said, I encourage you to not purchase the game for what it could be but what it is right now. Please only purchase this game if you believe you would be satisfied with a small scope sandbox with a few satisfying behaviors. This is not a huge complex game. This is a very fun physics toy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T19:10:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a7720fed949ee64a90c55ccf9717f40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RealityBeholder"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RealityBeholder"], "esrb_rating": null}
