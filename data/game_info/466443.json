Every ten seconds, a random modifier is chosen (Inverted controls, slow bullets, low speed, exploding shots, etc.), giving the game challenge and getting out of control. Monsters too will get out of control if you don't kill them fast enough.</p>\n<p>I am fourteen years old, and this is my first game jam! Hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>Music and SFX composed by my friend ThePatientHusky (Benjamin Wang) during the jam.
