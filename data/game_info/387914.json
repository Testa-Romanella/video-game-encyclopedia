I recently found all my old projects and decided to share them with everyone. I have come a long way since these projects, and even now I continue to work hard on learning more about game design. Creating games is my dream and my passion.</p>\n<p>I may return to development on \"Inevitable\" at some point, but for now \"Project XH\" is my main focus, a 3D arenaFPS game inspired by Quake 3, Descent 2, and Half-Life 2.
