You become mayor and take charge of an empty plot of land, tasked with building and creating your own sim empire from scratch! Along the way, you will have to care for and provide for your citizens, deal with crime and pollution, navigate the waters of the external market economy, respond to disasters, and more. All while trying to build and grow your very own city!<br/><br/>If you love city simulation games (like I do) but are tired of the constant in app purchase festivals which have become the norm for this genre, then I think that this game is for you. The original city simulator was my all time favorite game when I was growing up, so I want to make this a game that I will want to enjoy playing as well!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:00:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63d1508a5db198e1882be70f1cac7ac4_GwZOPoi.jpg", "website": "https://apps.ape-apps.com/ape-city/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ape Apps"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Brandon Stecklein"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
