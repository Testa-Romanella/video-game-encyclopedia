But fear not! for Sam is always here to help. Now you are Sam and you have to help Sean out!<br/>How far can you go? The fate of hundreds of arts lies on your shoulders!</p>\n<p>Oh, I didn't want to put any pressure on you, bu-ut... Anti doesn't seem to like this idea. He may also have sent his minions for your soul... still, you'll handle it, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good luck, Sammy!<br/><br/><strong>AUTHOR'S WORDS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Hello! Thanks for checking out this page in the first place! :)<br/>It's a very simple game made in Unity 5/Unity 2017. Hope you'll like it! But if not, please tell me what you didn't like. Maybe I can make SamsArtHunt better with your contribution, who knows?<br/>You can both play it online here or download it on your flash driver, or whatever, as you wish. Both versions will be updated equally frequent.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e92/e92cd914726926bf4cd235df5331ac9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Raijuu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
