Tap a tile to make it rotate and make sure that all tiles together create a seamless looping animated flow. The sides of each tile should match the looping animation of all neighbouring tiles to achieve a perfect flow. There should be no loose ends. Keep rotating the pieces to connect all the lines, creating a closed shape pattern with a looping animation. Watch the shape come magically alive when all animations connect to each other. <br/><br/>There is no (time) pressure, move limit or score threshold in these puzzle games, just relax and make things looping! <br/><br/>In case you get stuck solving the puzzle, subtle hints are given.<br/><br/>Enjoy fifty levels with an increasing grid size, challenging your patience and perception. Levels are randomly generated each time a new game is started, providing an endless amount of unique puzzles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T01:44:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f6/4f6e92c94dc07599f7e5019482ecb07b_VqHAgNd.jpg", "website": "http://www.wienelware.nl", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lidwien Veugen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Lidwien Veugen"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
