Sheriff Alex Truman has a peaceful life dealing with lost dogs, trivial disputes, and a few drunks here and there. He should be the happiest lawman in the world. But there's just one small part of him that longs for some excitement, for something that would break the monotony he doesn't even realise is eating him alive.<br/><br/>One cold November night it seems his unspoken wishes may have been granted when he\u2019s involved in a car accident with a man who appears suddenly in the middle of the road. Alex is fine, but the man ends up in hospital with a broken leg, and several cracked ribs. Nobody knows who this guy is or where he has come from, and to make matters worse, he won\u2019t speak. Finally the town has its first real mystery, and Alex is overjoyed. But that joy is to be short lived.<br/><br/>With no way of finding out the man\u2019s identity, he\u2019s moved to the local state mental health facility, and life in Deacon Oaks goes back to normal, until two months later when Alex gets a call informing him that the \u201croad guy\u201d has at last spoken. Three words were all he would say \u2013 \u201cCold Winter Farm, Cold Winter Farm, Cold Winter Farm\u201d, over and over again.<br/><br/>Alex has no idea what it means, but he does know that Cold Winter Farm is on the edge of town, and that\u2019s good enough. The mystery is back, and Alex wants to get to the bottom of it right away. Problem is, the biggest storm in fifty years is heading towards town \u2013 he\u2019ll never make it out to the farm and back before the storm hits. But Alex doesn\u2019t care \u2013 something deep inside is driving him \u2013 he has to know who the \u201croad guy\u201d is, and he has to know now. Abandoning all rational thought and ignoring the warnings of his deputy, he grabs the keys to the 4x4 and heads out.<br/><br/>Ten minutes after he arrives at the farm, the storm is so out of control, that it uproots a tree, which falls onto the house, crushing the roof, and trapping Alex in the basement. That\u2019s not all though. The fallen tree has opened up a hidden doorway, which leads to a secret corridor. At the end of the corridor is an elevator, and the only place it can go is down. With no chance of being rescued until the next day, and with the overpowering need to find answers drowning out the fear he feels, Alex decides to take the elevator down.<br/><br/>But what will be waiting for him at the bottom? Will it explain the origins and identity of the \u201croad guy\u201d? Will it explain why the \u201croad guy\u201d was walking in the middle of the road, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the freezing winter? Will it explain why he wouldn\u2019t speak for two months? And if it does, will the answers be simple, or will they be ultimately more disturbing and terrifying than anyone could imagine?<strong>Enhanced Edition</strong><br/>The \"enhanced\" edition of Corrosion: Cold Winter Waiting has been converted from its original square (4:3) resolution of 1024x768 to a higher widescreen (16:9) resolution of 1280x720 to better suit widescreen displays.<br/><br/>Other updates include a new inventory and larger in game text for easier reading, as well as several general improvements throughout.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/842/8423ea3100b63e24542ba69d21335a78.jpg", "website": "http://www.coldwinterwaiting.com", "rating": 2.43, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 195, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Viperante"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Viperante"], "esrb_rating": null}
