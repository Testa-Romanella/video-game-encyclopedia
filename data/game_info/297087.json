A sci-fi static screen platform shoot 'em up for the Commodore 64. Featuring 16 levels of alien blasting.<br/><br/><strong>SCENARIO</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It\r\nis the future. Scientists have discovered a form of energy crystals\r\non the planet Vektor. These crystals might be able to protect the\r\nworld from alien invasion. The Vektor crystals have been gathered and\r\ntransported safely to Earth. </p>\n<p>But\r\none of the scientists on board the transport ship was unexpectedly\r\nbitten by an alien \u2013 and he himself then mutated into a humanoid\r\nalien.</p>\n<p>On\r\nEarth, a huge complex of 16 floors was built to store the crystals.\r\nThey were protected by security forces. Later, an alien mothership\r\nappeared above this Vortex Complex and a slimy green alien took over\r\nthe security system. Aliens then beamed into each chamber to guard\r\nthe crystals... So that an invasion can take place.</p>\n<p>The\r\nPrime Minister, Ed Master, has called for your help. You don a\r\nprotective black suit, and arm yourself with a powerful laser. You\r\ngrab a swipe card and enter the building. You realise that the\r\nbuilding is not how it was before \u2013 considering that it is now\r\ninfested with aliens. Trigger happy, you are happy for action and\r\nhave an appetite of destruction at last!<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Programming and title graphics by <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Game graphics by <strong>Alf Yngve</strong><br/>Music and sound effects by <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Original PC musical scores (In game and\u00a0 game over) by <strong>Joachim Wijnhoven<br/></strong>Freeload Tape turbo loader by <strong>Paul Hughes<br/></strong>Level decompression by <strong>Magnus Lind<br/><br/></strong>(C)2017-2019 The New Dimension as freeware<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2d/e2d11356d0a72755353e5ed61853e11e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
