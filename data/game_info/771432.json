Try to break all 4 seals atleast once to get the boss to his lowest moving speed.<br/></p>\n<p>Still gonna make the 3D models for the boss and 3 hero's<br/>(2 Hero's are done but havent been imported yet)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T05:02:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/05295f99ce4ebaf185b085884a9daf09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Kormai"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
