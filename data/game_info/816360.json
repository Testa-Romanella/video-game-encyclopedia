Will you be able to live with them?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Perseverance: Part 3 is the latest and final episode of the drama/horror visual novel series where the only thing juicier than the gossip are the guts being spilled left and right. In Part 1 you play as Jack Cutter, a father who is struggling to keep his family together in the face of an otherworldly threat coming from the nearby military base. In Part 2 you control Karen, a calculated assassin on the hunt for a mysterious girl in the same remote town of Grey Ville. Finally, in Part 3 you will swap between both of the characters and help them form an unlikely alliance and face the overbearing danger as a team.<br/><br/>Together, they will help the remaining survivors escape from the zombie invasion brought upon them by a mad scientist. It won\u2019t be easy though, in their way stand bloodthirsty monsters, hostile military personnel, the cruel local sheriff, and the hardest obstacle of them all - the demons of their pasts. How will their story end? That\u2019s entirely up to you. Will you make the right choices?<br/><br/><br/><br/>During your playthrough, you\u2019ll have over 200 decisions to make and they will all influence how the plot progresses, so choose wisely. Will you help save humanity from the zombie outbreak or will you take the selfish path and save yourself and those dearest to you? No choice is a wrong choice but think through each and every step or you may just step off a cliff.<br/><br/>The Perseverance series draws from stories like \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d, \u201c28 Days Later\u201d, \u201cBlindness\u201d, \u201cRevivals\u201d and most of all \u2013 \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d.
