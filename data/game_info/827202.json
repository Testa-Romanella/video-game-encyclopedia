We have been assigned a new task - to locate and solve the problem in one of the Oases.</p>\n<p>We are pulled into a thicket of previously unknown vegetation, which arose as a result of the absolute pollution of that planet. We are given a simple and strict command from the headquarters - to bring all the mechanisms and systems of the Oasis to the state of their initial operation.</p>\n\n<p>We developed the game in Unreal Engine 5.</p>\n<p>We started work in November 2021.</p>\n<p>Designing Recycle was a team challenge for many reasons. Among other things, it required a lot of technological awareness from us to create the game in a version of the engine, which was still in the beta phase.</p>\n<p>The graphics were made by us ourselves. When creating a procedurally generated open world, we had to adapt the artistic vision and apply all known technical solutions so that the technological demo could be created.</p>\n<p>Credits: Grzegorz D\u0105browski (leader, technical coordinator), Agata Jankowiak (art director), Wiktoria Gawlik (3d artist), Agata Samborska (level designer), Anna Manaj (3D artist, animator), Krzysztof Chyli\u0144ski (system programmer), Maximilian Sandmann (sound composer), Katarzyna Knefel (texture artist).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T09:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0c/f0c124baaa773ed30b1a9d502ffd4e8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["browsky"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
