The idea was to create a coop game where 2 players choose classes like Knight, Mage, Archer or Priest. The classes combination were supposed to create different ways to navigate through the maze and defeat the enemies and traps.</p><p>Keyboard is only mapped to player 1. If you want to have 2 players, you need to plug two joypads, as there is currently now way to select keyboard for p1 and pad for p2.</p>\n<p>Only two classes are implemented so far. And not enough enemies and traps to keep the game fun. But at least the level generation and the platforming logic works well.</p>\n<p>The source code is available on\u00a0Github.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T22:58:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/685/685619b0d3af00f99b2d18b758862812.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Kivutar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
