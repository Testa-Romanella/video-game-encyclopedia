Merging real and imaginary elements, it draws inspiration from the charming town of Assisi, in Italy. You are left to find your own way around by touch and sight alone. Exploring a whole world becomes a matter of lifting your fingers.<br/><br/>Our goal? To fool your eyes and brain considering it all real. When you go back with your memory to the day you first opened this Mentalbox, you will think it was you on the cobblestone, you in the alleys, you in the catacombs...<br/><br/>While developing Castlerama, we had to face the fact that newer devices such as iPhone4s and iPad2s are very different from their predecessors, iPhone3GSs and iPads, in that the former have twice as much memory. In order to have the app run on all devices, we had to compromise quite a bit, pushing the old devices to their limits (risking crash if other applications are left running) while keeping the new devices well behind their capabilities.<br/><br/>Powered by Unreal Engine.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:55:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a7/9a722bd57160a49d7403d7e82f2d21f1.jpeg", "website": "http://www.codenrama.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["CODENRAMA"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Michele Bohm"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
