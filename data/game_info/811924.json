This game is all about a cute drill that LOVES to mine, the only problem is he only can carry so much energy. So your job is to continue mining for gems, ore\u00a0and making sure to pick up extra coal, as he loses it as he moves in any direction or hits a rock! And when he emptied on coal, our cute friend passes away. RIP Drilly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy it, this is my first creative game that I have made for others to play so it's definitely rough, but it was an amazing first project!</p>\n<p>Late but F or f11 to change out of fullscreen!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to Slimey Pixel for making the music!</p>\n<p>also few assets were bought and downloaded from\u00a0pauliuw, and bruno</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T14:50:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/409/40903a823a895f51880a98bbd735acce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The_Mindstormer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
