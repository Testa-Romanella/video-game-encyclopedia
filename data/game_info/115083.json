In a bid to break the stalemate, the sentients reached to the heavens, travelling in the wake of stars in search of the planet God Fur where they could claim all the remaining God Fur in existence, and secure fur-based superiority for themselves for all eternity. </em>\n</p><p> <em>Players join the story as the intrepid space faring animals race towards the God Fur. As they approach their ships warn of the debris ahead but unable to give even a second to their rivals the steadfast animal-stronauts crash through the debris, ejecting just in time to land on a nearby asteroid. Now time is against them as they must scramble through the asteroid field to claim planet God Fur or die in space.</em>\n</p><p>\tJump from asteroid to asteroid and use your grappling hook to traverse across space to make it to the planet before the other players!
