You have to help him make decisions so that he could survive, go deeper into the labyrinth, escape or even complete his mission.</p>\n<p>You select what he does with number keys and get the results in your log as well as new choices. Your goal is to complete enough events in the \"Mission\" or the \"Escape\" event chain.<br/></p>\r\nPanels\r\n<p>The game is divided into several panels:</p>\n<p><strong>Activity Log:\u00a0</strong>Writes out the results of your actions.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Status</strong><strong>: </strong>Shows the current energy, food and oxygen levels of the astronaut.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Choices:</strong> Shows what decisions are mapped to which keys.</p>\n<p><strong>Dice:</strong> When your choice has a percentage success rate you get a 100 sided dice roll in this tab. Remember: 80% means that 1-20 fails it.</p>\n<p><strong>Distance: </strong>This one shows the location of your camp, the astronaut and the max distance on a linear axis. Try to keep the difference small.</p>\n<p><strong>Progress:</strong> The one with a lot of '-' shows your progress with the event chains.</p>\r\nChoices\r\n<p>They use a shorthand (-1; -1; -1) to show what (energy, food, oxygen) you will lose or gain when attempting it.<br/></p>\n<p>When you explore you expend (-1; 0; -1) for every point between camp and max. If the distance grows too great pick up your camp and relocate it (keep in mind that events do not fire when the camp is not set up).</p>\n<p>When exploring you will get a random event. Completing them usually gives you and increase in stats or progress. If nothing happens, you can always gather some food.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T18:56:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac2/ac250c00be4d9a1c113c175e628b292d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Edvcel"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
