{"id": 207384, "slug": "flag-marathon", "name": "Flag Marathon", "name_original": "Flag Marathon", "description": "<p>Make\r\n your way to the next level by collecting all the scattered flags. \r\nYou'll control this round character &amp; must keep him safe in the long\r\n journey or else you'll be thrown to the first floor (ouch!!!). But,.. \r\nyou have no great legendary weapon or some kind of blasting laser that \r\nshould wipe all your enemies,.. then how you're going to make it? \r\nLuckily, there is a kind-hearted shopkeeper who would provide you tips \r\n&amp; some items like bulb, cheese, curry puff, layer cake,..etc(what \r\nshould i do with those items huh?!!). Never mind, just play the game \r\n&amp; experience it yourself. Experience is a best teacher right? (for \r\nsome case, yes,..)</p>\n<p>This game contains simple control mechanic as explained in the game later. (Press F4 for full screen or default screen size) <br/>Just small amount of levels: 10 default levels &amp; 3 secret levels. <br/>11 items (mostly foods actually) <br/>Most sprites are listed in credits &amp; some also were drawn by myself \r\nespecially the main character. I called him Mr Bo (not Boooo!). <br/>\r\nThe flag that I applied in the game is my national country flag, Malaysia=).</p>\n<p>This was my first experience in coding the game so I focused more on \r\ncoding things rather than drawing my own sprites. I wish I can create my\r\n own art identity in the next future progress game. A very helpful &amp;\r\n construct criticisms are welcomed.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing. Have a nice day. <br/></p>\n<p>Credit Sections:</p>\n<p>Resources used in Flag Marathon V1.0</p>\n<p>Links;-</p>\n<p>1.
