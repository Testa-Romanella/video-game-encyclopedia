I claim no ownership of the concepts contained within. This particular implementation is developed entirely in JavaScript.</p><p>A piece will fall from the top. You will need to move that piece around in order to place it at the bottom of the play area. If you can fill an entire row, that row will be removed, and you will be awarded with points. This also keeps the board fairly clear, giving you room to maneuver the falling pieces to their intended locations. Clearing multiple lines at once will give you quite a bit more points.</p><p>The objective is to last as long as you can, getting the highest score possible.</p><p>Right now, you can use the arrow keys to move the piece around. The up arrow will rotate the piece. The down arrow will make the piece fall faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T12:54:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f8802f02c3c94ba6542da53e2e6d13e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Homemade Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
