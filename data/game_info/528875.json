It is made to be interacted with via Bare Conductive Touch Board on the rear-projection display that was constructed for this project, the original intention being that the object follows you around by using floor touch sensors to detect where you are standing. But due to the magic of the internet you too can experience stuff rotating!!!<br/></p>\n<p>Press random keys to rotate the object, and enjoy noises. The objects change out with ~cool effects~ every once in a while.<br/></p>\n<p>Also available as a download below, on Windows and Mac.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T04:12:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c74071c5b325e385c2f30d4939ed161.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["CakeCadaver"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
