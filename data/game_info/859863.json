Don't let the fire go out, you can see how full it is with the dots above the fire. Feed the fire too much and it will burn faster. Stand near the fire (purple dots) to be safe at night from prowling wolves.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T08:25:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef802db4e69f8952731689a8e7f70a1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NorthStateGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
