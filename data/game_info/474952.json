You completed the first puzzle, now im going to show you a device that will let you do some pretty cool stuff. I present to you...the anti matter anti gravity changing field! Now your not in possession quite yet of the actual device that lets you change gravity at your own will, but run into this for now and it will have a similar effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Puzzle Done.

Fourth Puzzle Start:</strong></p>\n<p>Alright, you finally came this far. See? I told you that you would want to stick around. Anyways, here is the anti matter anti gravity changing field portable device system \u2122 ! For the sake of both of our ears, I will now be calling it the GDS (Gravity. Device. System.) Alright, onto some more testing, only this and 2 more puzzles before your next big surprise!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>End Game:</strong></p>\n<p>Surprise! I didn't really expect anyone to make it this far to be honest. So surprise, there is no end of the game. Here il just program this confetti in. There you go! Good job on completing the game.
