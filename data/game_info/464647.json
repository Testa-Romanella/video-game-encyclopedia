The submarine you will be using has 5 main systems: Vision, Audio, Map, Cannon, and Engines. When you are in the stronghold, each system has the chance to go out of control and be disabled!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taking damage from enemy probes can also damage systems. Damaged systems will stay disabled until repaired, which you can do by clicking the corresponding buttons on the bottom of the screen with the mouse. Fixing a system will temporarily disabled another.</p>\n<p>Use W,A,S, and D to move, and you can aim and shoot the cannon with the Mouse and Left Click. You can also press Escape to exit the level at any time.\u00a0Make your way through the stronghold to destroy the enemy core and the probes while managing your 5 systems. Good Luck!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:59:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/422/42271c3c77d7f81295aa734912d5b1ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Icosmophedron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
