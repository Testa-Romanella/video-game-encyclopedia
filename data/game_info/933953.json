There is one seeker that can look at the whole map from above, but only through a small view cone. The seeker needs to find the runners, the other type of player, that run around the map, gather coins, take cover, and try to bring their coins to the seeker castle.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You need at least 3 players, 2 controllers, and 2 monitors  for the game to work. The seeker player plays with keyboard and mouse on the first monitor, while the other players play with controllers on the second monitor, ideally facing\u00a0the other direction.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T13:56:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/556/5562a1ee93fc33a0eb87e2ef8c3313af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KuroiX"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
