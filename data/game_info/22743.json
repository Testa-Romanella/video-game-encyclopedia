After numerous wars and several environmental disasters, only two world powers remain; the United Civilized States (UCS) covering the American continent, Western Europe and North Africa, and the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) covering the coherent landmasses of Eastern Europe and Asia.\n<br/><br/>\nThe damage caused by the long wars led both world powers to evacuate the population to recently built underground cities. Australia and most parts of Africa were sacrificed during the long wars, which lasted several decades. Highly toxic biological and chemical weapons were developed on these continents, leaving them so badly contaminated, that no human life can survive there. Most of the world's population forgot that this land ever existed.\n<br/><br/>\nConflicts between UCS and the ED escalated and became the final world war. This war will decide who will get the last of the available natural resources and ultimately rule the world.\n<br/><br/>\nMultiplayer notice: Although the game contains \"net\" and \"serial\" buttons, actual multiplayer functionality was never implemented by the game developers.The Trilogy includes the original Earth 2140 campaign along with Mission Pack 1 and Final Conflict Mission Pack\nThe unique Virtual General feature that takes over the minutiae of commanding your army\nFuturistic warfare in a post-apocalyptic setting", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-11T05:42:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/8018f55256c8ff746c0c5d53076f7d99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.4, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 91, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 475, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Reality Pump"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
