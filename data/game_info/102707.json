It starts as a Bullet Hell, and, as you progress, other genres will soon intertwine (after the game's intro episode).\u00a0It's\u00a0not\u00a0a\u00a0simple\u00a0game,\u00a0in any\u00a0means. Be prepared for\u00a0a\u00a0long\u00a0adventure!</p>\r\nWhat is it about?\r\n<p>This game takes place after a major crisis called \"The Ad-Pocalypse\". Ad Corporations merged into a huge one, which gained power and began to control people's lifes. Because of that, free will is at risk. Two sides fought: the people and the Ad Corporation, but they lost against the Corporations Robots. Now only one fighter remains. His mission is to destroy ads once and for all! <br/>Be prepared to fight ads, literally!<br/></p>\n\r\nThis is just the Beginning!\r\n<p>I've already started working on post-demo content. The game will significantly change after the demo. Our protagonists will embark on different kind of quirky adventures. Each one of them will bring a new twist to the gameplay!</p>\r\nNew to Bullet Hells? Don't be afraid!\r\n<p>Ad Wars breaks the traditional arcade structure giving the player lots of options to progressively try higher difficulties. The challenge is up to you! I'm making sure that everyone can enjoy this game. Also if you're a hardcore bullet hell player, I'll make difficult patterns just for you!<br/>Is a level still too hard for you? You can spend energy points to buy lives or power up your own attacks!<br/>You can even customize your attack options to your own convenience!</p>\r\nLiked the Game? You can Help me a Lot!\r\n<p>As I've stated before, I'm a solo developer and I'm making everything for this game (art, sprites, writing, music, sfx, code), putting a lot of hours, money, energy, and love (lots of love).<br/><strong>Sharing this game will be a huge help!</strong><br/><em>Donations will help me focus more on the game, and worry less about everything else.<br/></em><strong><em>Important:</em></strong> I will make this game, regardless of money, work, and other problems so don't worry about that!</p>\r\nSites &amp; More Info\r\n<p>Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/aglitch<br/></p>\n<p>Discord Server: https://discord.gg/qxAmdrg</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/aGlitch_<br/></p>\n<p>GameJolt:\u00a0https://gamejolt.com/games/AdWars/334773<br/></p>\r\nNew Update! 0.2.8.5: Sprite Fixes, Faster Level 1 &amp; More Fixes!\r\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong>: https://aglitch.itch.io/adwars/devlog/40265/ad-wars-0285-faster-level-1-and-fixes<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>- - -</p>\n<p>* Ad Wars Controllers *</p>\n<p>- Keyboard -</p>\n<p>Movement: Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Shoot / Confirm: Z</p>\n<p>Bomb / Other Stuff: X</p>\n<p>Slow Movement: C</p>\n<p>Pause: Esc<br/></p>\n<p>- - -</p>\n<p>- X-Input -</p>\n<p>Movement: Joystick / D-Pad</p>\n<p>Shoot: A</p>\n<p>Bomb: Rb</p>\n<p>Slow Movement: Lb</p>\n<p>Pause: Start</p>\n<p>- - -</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/791/791cb74bf46415aff6464d39d3d33a23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["\u03b1Glitch"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
