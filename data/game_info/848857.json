I developed a little game using someone else's image as a starting point. It can be beaten in about seven minutes.</p>\n<p>I made the character art, backgrounds, and title/game over screens. The game uses plugins by\u00a0LadyBaskerville and\u00a0Yanfly Engine Plugins. Everything else\u00a0is a default RPG Maker MV asset.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>KEYBOARD<br/>Arrow keys to move cursor<br/>Enter or Z to select<br/>Escape or X to cancel<br/><br/>MOUSE<br/>Left click to select<br/>Right click to cancel<br/><br/>MOBILE<br/>Touch to select<br/>Pinch the screen to cancel</p>\n\n<p>The video on the sidebar here shows the game being played from start to finish.
