Objects in space and each (sub-)point of the grid in the representation are distorted every frame according to a precalculated density grid.<br/></p>\n<p>This project was developed for a userstudy and was not initially intended to be published. It is only for demonstration purposes.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sourcecode:<br/>\u00a0https://github.com/vyanor/GravitationalWavesVisualization<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Toggle Manual Mode (for usage without VR headset): M. This switches arrow control from earth to the \"measuring device\"</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> The current immersion values are adjusted for our testing environment with a HTC Vice Pro Eye. In order to manipulate those values ingame and adjust them to your HMD use the values 1-2 and 3-4 for eye convergence and eye distance respectively<br/></p>\n<ul><li>VR controls:<br/>Player: <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Offset to current position with manual controls (see below).\u00a0 </li>Binary star system:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Change distance: Trigger + Up or Trigger + Down<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Change angular velocity: Trigger + Left or Trigger + Right</ul>\n<ul><li>Manual Mode (PC) controls:<br/>Player:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moving in x-z space: W, S, Q and E<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Turn left right: A and D<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Up - Down: Space and C<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Tilt up - down: Shift + W and Shift + S<br/><br/>Earth:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Moving in x-z space: Arrow Up, Left, Down, Right<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Up - Down: O and L<br/><br/>Binary star system:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Change distance: Z and U<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Change angular velocity: H and J</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T03:55:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20f/20f7fe84075e6e55d5c2089cf03dfc45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vyanor"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
