{"id": 505636, "slug": "cubeformer", "name": "Cubeformer", "name_original": "Cubeformer", "description": "<p>A platformer game I started when I was 9, Remade with modern tools and music by ASTRONIC.</p>\n<p>This game isn't the best it could be - It's the game I would've made when I was 9 had I not quit in the middle. For example, I purposely drew all the graphics, instead of asking someone more talented to do so, and kept I the assets from the original game.<br/>It was quite the learning experience - I learned how to do so much from making the game:<br/>Pause menus, custom controls, correct aspect ratios...<br/>I learned it all because of this. Some are implemented quite poorly, (In the code side of things)<br/>but they gave me a general idea of what I need to do which I will surely use in future games.<br/></p>\n\n<p>That being said, I hope you can still enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Some info:</p><p>The game is made with GameMaker Studio 2.<br/></p><p>I added the last bits of code on the 9th of October, 2020, Which is the day I am writing this and the day I am releasing the game.<br/>The modern verison of the game started development on the 1st of December, 2019.<br/><br/>If you have any criticism about the game, Feel free to comment about it, but keep in mind the game is kinda bad in a few areas so it would really be the continuation to the game I made when I was 9, As if I never abandoned it.<br/></p>\n<p>A few notes:<br/><br/></p>\n<p>1. If you get a white screen and the title screen music plays, Just alt + tab out of the application and back in.</p>\n<p>2. If you for whatever reason want this game ported to Linux or Mac, and you have a system running one of the OSes, Contact me via Discord (Skirlez#5521) or Twitter (@Skirlez3).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T04:43:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1a/a1afbf98fe1e22df2aeb691fa3573cd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skirlez", "ASTRONIC"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
