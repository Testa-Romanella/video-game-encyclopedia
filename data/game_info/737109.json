There are 3 levels and the difficulty will increase as you go on. In level 1, there are fences to protect you from falling. In level 2, there's a jump you need to use in order to get to the end, and it's a little bit difficult. In level 3, the starting point is slanted and you need to be careful.\u00a0\u00a0You can use 'WASD' or 'arrow' buttons to control the ball, as well as using 'space' to jump!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T07:51:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb9/eb97c1a45a015df3a5f2e00857056ba8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yaogeezi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
