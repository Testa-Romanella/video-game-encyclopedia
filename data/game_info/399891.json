This was one of the first major projects for each of the developers, and through the creation of all our own models, we were able to learn not only about the technical side of game development, but also the game art side as well. We did use some pre-made assets to accelerate the development of the game; we used\u00a0the Magic Mirror asset for (some) large mirrors, and the Aura 2 asset for volumetric lighting.\u00a0</p>\r\nProcess Log\r\n<p>This game was created as a final project for the class ATLAS 4140 - Game Development at CU Boulder, and so the game comes along with a process log which can be found on our GitHub repository for this project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:03:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/720/720d27181be74027497a4eeaf9066fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jaristotle", "Karasel", "Peter Rosenthal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
