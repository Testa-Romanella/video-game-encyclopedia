It stars <em>You</em> in the role of\u00a0<em>Player 1</em> as you're about to complete your adventure. However, the dastardly wizard eyeAM has other plans! Now you must escape their dungeon and reclaim your freedom.\u00a0</p>\nBIG NOTE:<p><strong>R - to restart on Death.</strong></p><p>There's no visual indicator! I forgot to add the trigger. The subsequent tries are easier.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD\u00a0 - to move</p>\n<p>L click - to charge up your sword swing</p>\n<p>Escape - to quit the game</p>\n<p>R - to restart on Death.</p>\n\r\nAcknowledgements and Influences\r\n<p>Right, so I'd feel really scummy if I didn't acknowledge this from the get go. EyeAM is based on Queen from Delta Rune, their sprite(s) are literally re-skinned. I'm not a professional character designer and by no means wish to claim the character as wholesale original.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong><em>Design, Programming, and (some) Art</em></strong></p>\n<p>Agapios Pip Kokkos</p>\n<p><strong><em>Voice Acting:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Blair The Bean</p>\n<p>Pip</p>\n<p><strong><em>Feat.
