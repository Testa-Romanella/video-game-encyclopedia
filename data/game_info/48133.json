Create your very own team of helpers, mercenaries and apprentices, and head out on expeditions!<br/><br/>If a monster appears during an expedition, choose a card and attack! Will you use a Recovery Card? Maybe an Attack Card? Refine your strategy and fight wisely!<br/>Monsters feature Wind, Water, Lightning or Earth alignments, so choose a compatible weapon before taking on each enemy.<br/><br/>Of course, each pilot's skills are also important. Develop your character with various training exercises, and learn new skills that will aid you while exploring this dangerous land!<br/><br/>At the fabled New World, you can join up with other players and go on expeditions. There are many powerful monsters, so you probably won't stand a chance on your own. Push forward by helping each other!<br/>So, can you bring peace to the Uncivilized Land?<br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>'****************************<br/>\u2022 All game progress is stored on your device.
