However, our devoted development team is constantly working to bring new features and improvements to our platform such as interactive wiki analytics, a social profile system, achievements, and many more features. We work with both the community and our staff to continuously create a better set of tools for ourselves and our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wiki Connect is Free</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you wondering about the cost of this opportunity? Wiki Connect is a free program that we offer to developers and publishers. We simply ask that you endorse us in a community announcement as the official wiki, provide us with some basic art assets such as a background and logo, and link to the wiki from the navigation bar on the game\u2019s site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we\u2019re always happy to use additional game information, stats and graphical assets to seed the wiki with content, but it is not a requirement for Wiki Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excite Your Fanbase</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamepedia loves to work on additional exciting promotions with our partners. Just let us know in advance of large announcements, updates, and events and we can help spread the word with articles and social media announcements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamepedia is also working to build a top-tier streaming program on Twtich, leveraging our embedded Twitch stream unit on wiki pages. Ask us about how to get your game featured!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:54:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78f9b4296530f2113fc0628386e687b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ivirgin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
