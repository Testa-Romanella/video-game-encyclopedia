The controls for this game are wasd or the arrows keys. You direct the marble around the downward slope to the teleporter at the bottom. Hitting anything Red resets the level. Good luck.</p>\n<p>The first level introduces you to the basic mechanics of the game, making you go through some simple obstacles. The second level introduces you to the red reset obstacles, which move you back to the start. Be warned. The third level tests what you've learned for a final showdown at the end. Good luck gamer, you will need it.</p>\n\n<p>Note: For some reason, in unity the game behaves differently on different versions</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T16:19:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdca49202b1c360caa317431dc330ef0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NiravGolyalla"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
