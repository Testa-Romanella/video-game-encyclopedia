Who knows. There is an exe file too if it doesn't.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left\u00a0</strong>click on a flower and\u00a0<strong>right\u00a0</strong>click on a different flower to breed two flowers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The resulting flower produced will have a mix of the two parent flowers' genetics. Hover over a flower to examine their genes.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>For colour:\u00a0<strong>RR = Red, Rr = Pink, rr = white.\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For height:\u00a0<strong>TT or Tt = tall and tt = short.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> seeds with the watering can so that they can grow into plants. Each day the seeds can grow, but they will only grow if it has been watered\u00a0(I set the min water level to 0.2 so they don't need so much water to grow)</p>\n<p>Customers will give you <strong>tasks </strong>and you must place plants in the task boxes to sell them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will get 3 new\u00a0tasks a day, press '<strong>Go to sleep</strong>' to start a new day. Press '<strong>Next customer</strong>' to get a new customer (yes, I know they are just the same pink haired girl sorry I will make more later). I randomised between 3 names just so I know the task system is working and they are displaying individual customer names.</p>\n<p>I made this for a previous game jam, ScoreSpace #14, and I wanted to develop the idea a bit more.\u00a0I ended up being in a bit of a rush as I didn't have the whole month due to a holiday I took at the start of January. Also I was overly ambitious with the time I had,\u00a0so naturally there are <strong>a lot of bugs</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0There is an issue where you can't sell plants even though you have fulfilled the order criteria. I'm not sure why this is as I only encountered it today, but I will have a look.</p>\n<p>Used\u00a0https://elements.envato.com/message-pop-HCSGDAL\u00a0for 'pop' sound effect\r\n</p>\n<p>Used 100% free fonts from 1001 Fonts:\r\n</p>\n<p>KarmaFuture font for title - Typodermic Fonts\r\n</p>\n<p>Roses are FF0000 font for UI text -\u00a0\u00a0<strong>http://ajpaglia.com/</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:52:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ece/ececd0a3db7c553dfba7a9d3b509260d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Artemis"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
