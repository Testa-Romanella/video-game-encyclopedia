Oh, it also crashes when you win but I don't have enough time to fix that lmao.</p>\n<p>anyways, here's how you play the game:</p>\n<p>you control the white circle and must enter the triangle of the correct rotation marked in your body, you can interact with blocks that are the same colour as you or that are grey, and you can move\u00a0by\u00a0launching yourself to the mouse cursor with m1.</p>\n<p>Sounds easy but there's a catch, as you also control your antipode, the black sphere and you must have it reach its designated triangle as well to win the game, the black sphere copies every input you give to the white sphere so you must prevent both of them from dying.</p>\n<p>oh, also the camera only follows the white sphere, so you must also prevent the black sphere from going offscreen or you die aswell!</p>\n<p>have fun and thanks for playing :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T07:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a25/a25d501af3d8c3fb56e0ccc89dc7cceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AniiSama"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
