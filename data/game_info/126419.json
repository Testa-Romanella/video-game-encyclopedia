And as you guys can imagine, that requires time! ;)</p>\n<p>In order to develop \"Rob, The Dog!\" (and making future updates available from time to time), I'm using the \"game pack\" process, meaning that everytime a game pack is fully completed and after being intensely tested, it will be incorporated into the main game and available for download.</p>\n<p>Each \"game pack\" consists of 3 new game levels, namely, a \"forest-type\" level (easy difficulty level), a \"cave-type\" level (average/tough difficulty level), and a \"bonus-type\" level (score and fun purpose level). The current file available for download already has in it the first two pack levels (a total of 6 game levels), which represents about 1 hour of permanent gameplay.</p>\n<p>Hope you guys may enjoy \"Rob, The Dog!\".<br/>And stay tuned for some more good stuff very soon...</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Rob, The Dog!\" is played under a 1200x600 pixel resolution window, using the following controls:</p>\n<p><strong>[L_Arrow/R_Arrow]</strong><br/>Movement keys</p>\n<p><strong>[Space_Key]</strong><br/>Rob performs the Jump movement</p>\n<p><strong>[L_Arrow (OR) R_Arrow + D_Arrow]</strong><br/>Rob performs the Slide movement<br/><em>Only available in specific moments/sectors of the level</em></p>\n<p><strong>[Return/Enter_Key]</strong><br/>Rob interacts with characters and/or objects</p>\n<p><strong>[LMouse_Button]</strong><br/>Collect _hidden_ bonus items</p>\n<p><strong>[R_Key]</strong><br/>Restart the current level</p>\n<p><strong>[Escape_Key]</strong><br/>Display level goals and main game controls</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/774/7748f602c6540030d29323218d8a06bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Micos"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
