Upon her death, her spirit became enlightened to her tribe's blind lust for battle regardless of their own well-being. In death, she has realised the folly in her command. She now seeks to impart this knowledge on her tribe so they may become self-aware enough to win the war and provide a better life for themselves without her leadership. Retaking her ancestors' structures on the remaining sky islands is where they must begin\u2026</p><p>You, the player, are the spirit of the slain Orc Chieftain. You must overlook your Orcish tribe as they meander around the sky islands they call home. Each Orc has their own wants and needs such as health, hunger, and interests. These are affected by their environment and actions of the Orc. You must manage the transportation between the sky islands in order to better equip and train the simple-minded Orcs before battle.</p><p>Please leave us some feedback when you're done, we would love to hear from you! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bdf514b789c08a6f11d9d6e9bf25599.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Goss", "TeamOrcward", "Dave2k17", "luke2256", "charligal", "Soulburner"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
