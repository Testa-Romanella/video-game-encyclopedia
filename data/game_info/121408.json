What's happening to me? I can't double jump anymore, and not<br/>even run fast! And why the energy can't flow out of my hands anymore?\"<br/>Dark Lord of Neraka: \"I have transferred the essence of each of your powers into<br/>Totems, hidden inside the Damned Jungle. Without your powers you can't stop me<br/>from taking Kota over!\"<br/>Pahlawan: \"I must get my powers back and stop the Dark Lord of Neraka!\"<br/>-----------------------------------------</p>\n<p>--------------- CHANGELOG ---------------<br/>version 1.1:<br/>- Bug fixes.<br/>- Simplified a bit a particularly hard part of the second level.<br/>- Added gamepad support.<br/>- Added ability to change the game's window scale by pressing the F4 key<br/>\u00a0 (previously the scale couldn't be changed and it was only 2x the resolution).</p>\n<p>version 1.0:<br/>- GBJAM 5 entry.<br/>-----------------------------------------</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc0ae82e64c21f10ecc60ce728b2b07f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fedeali"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
