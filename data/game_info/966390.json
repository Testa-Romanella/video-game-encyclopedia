Change perspective, yet, but it's still gonna work and feel as the default AR camera (device live camera). No spoilers here. Just download this game and you'll be stunned.<br/><br/>3D SPATIAL AUDIO<br/><br/>In this game, space speaks with you. Your position in the real world affects the audio you hear. Just like in real life, you can hear your surroundings. You can listen to \"see with your ears\" where a strange object is, maybe orbiting close to you. Maybe an explosion nearby. You have to listen to space.<br/><br/><br/>IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING<br/><br/>This is just the beginning. We plan on expanding the game in future update, with new stages and features. And you will get it without the need to pay more for it.<br/><br/>========<br/><br/>**If you enjoying playing the game, please consider leaving a review on the App Store.
