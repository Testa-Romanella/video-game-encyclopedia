This rewards\r\nfolk for coming back to practice their piloting and will help players\r\naccumulate SpaceBucks!\r\nIn addition to this, we\u2019ve squashed bugs, tightened bolts, and tweaked the User\r\nInterface.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Amongst all these changes, my personal favorite between version .9 and version\r\n1.0 of Planet Rabbit has actually been a casting decision. We\u2019ve changed our\r\n\u2018i\u2019 as in Planit to the more common \u2018e\u2019 as in Planet. The timing of this change\r\nis fortunate, since we had hoped to replace the Polyspice 'i' for a while.</p>\n<p>The Planet Rabbit Story begins with two Heroic Twins raised on the Rabbit\r\nHome World, a place described as a Crowded Utopia. Wondrous technology ensures\r\nthat nobody goes hungry or unsheltered, but even that can only stave off\r\noverpopulation issues for so long. To this end, the Rabbits have begun\r\nterraforming and colonizing other planets\u2026 Perhaps a bit too hastily. The first\r\nwave of colonists are already in need of rescue due to shoddily constructed\r\nSpace Habitats. A talented Tactician known as Commander Cabbage has revived the\r\n\u201cRabbiteers\u201d an organization of Volunteer Rescue Pilots. His first recruits?\r\nThe Twins, his very own grandchildren!</p>\n<p>This ever expanding Story will be told in bi-weekly 4Panel Comics\r\nillustrated by our very own Miss Alexandra.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We at Polyspice are a small and growing team of Developers intent on creating\r\nFun and Simple Mobile Games for families. Planet Rabbit is by far our biggest\r\ngame, and we are all very proud of it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T08:09:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95eabba7353d3d1985099d9aca3c867e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["polyspice"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
