You begin your adventure in search of \"the mythical artifact\". An object able to grant the holder untold power. You must explore the perilous terrain of the ravines to collect treasures to power yourself up, while defending yourself from dangerous foes along the way. Best of luck to you, brave adventurer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRavyne is a roguelike game that takes design inspiration from the classic roguelikes of the 80s. Designed to emulate the style of games like Rogue, it runs entirely in the Windows console, and uses text based graphics. However, unlike those classic dungeon crawling roguelikes, Ravyne takes place in a randomly generated overworld, instead of an underground dungeon. In Ravyne you are able to explore more natural looking terrain, and even dig through it when necessary.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T05:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e97/e97db914dd29adc4fc43b4a6d9571ee9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas Rinella"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nicholas Rinella"], "esrb_rating": null}
