You play as the charakter \"Ernst\" who tries to win the cabbage king contest in his allotment garden community. While you try to farm and harvest your cabbages, snails and dandelions will hinder your work. In the process Ernst gets more and more angry towards his gardening neighbors, who seem to breed snails and dandelions, witch harm his cabbages. When his anger-bar reaches the peek he will attack one of his neighbors untill he is dead. But you can also go full aggro and just kill your neighbors any time you want to provide some time without snails etc. to make it more enjojable to farm. The game also gets really strategic with different items you can buy in a shop to protect your cabbages and the possibility to watch reality TV to lower your anger. Depending on your behavior, there are multiple different endings you can reach.</p>\n<p>This game is based on a true story and the voiceacting is only available in german language. Have fun playing ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/435/435513a3fd7b1709d5178f7c1fd6044b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrokoLee"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
