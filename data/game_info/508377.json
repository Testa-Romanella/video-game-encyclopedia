{"id": 508377, "slug": "ballfoot", "name": "BallFoot", "name_original": "BallFoot", "description": "<p>BallFoot is a 2-4 player physics-based chaotic party game, set in a world where balls have gotten tired of being kicked around and are now playing sports with humans instead.<br/></p>\n<p>(Controllers Recommended)</p>\n<p>The premise\u00a0is that players control different kinds of balls and has to play football with a human. The team with the most points when the timer runs out, wins. The players can boost and jump into the human in order to push him into the opponents goal, where he is then blown back into the middle of the field. It is possible to disrupt other players by pushing them, but there are also different wacky power-ups, such as a hand that grabs and throws other balls away, a spiky mode to deflate and stun other balls, as well as super speed and supersized ball mode. The game contains two levels, one is the football field, which is the standard mode, and then the pinball level, where there are flippers and bumpers to make the game even more crazy and interesting.</p>\n<p>Created by:</p>\n<p>Bj\u00f8rn S\u00f8rensen</p>\n<p>Christian S\u00f8ndergaard Weatherley</p>\n<p>Joakim Nonboe Carlsen</p>\n<p>Kasper Egholm Endahl</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T07:22:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5a96d254f1409d03c090e82f0ddcb40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JoakimCarlsen"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
