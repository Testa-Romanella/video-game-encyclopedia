One day, you find yourself lost within a mysterious temple, when you come across a goddess incarnated as a jewel. Your job is to restore the goddess's power by breaking the seals found throughout the temple.</p>\n<p>To break a seal, you must match together all of the idols within it. This is done by moving your jewel onto arrow tiles, which shift your row or column in the given direction (and the idols along with it). Once you match up all the idols in a level, the game is over.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>D-PAD: Moves your jewel UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.</li><li>Z/C/N: Lets you choose a magic spell to use. Use LEFT and RIGHT to choose between them, and X/V/M to confirm. Use Z/C/N to go back.</li><li>X/V/M: Lets you enter a level on the world map.</li><li>P/Enter: Pauses the game. On the world map, this tells you a password (just in case!). In a level, this gives you the options to restart the level or give up.</li></ul>\r\nVersion History\r\n<ul><li><strong>v1.01</strong> (August 25th, 2019) Fixed some debug code</li>\n<li><strong>v1.0</strong> (August 25th, 2019) Initial release for GBJAM 7</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:24:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e826267908fc9fc9afafdbbcedc8fb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Josiah Winslow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
