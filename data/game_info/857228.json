Marvin the Minotaur. Defeat it and claim it's War Hammer if you so wish.\u00a0\u00a0From then on your opponents will be exceptional.\u00a0\u00a0The last fight is against the reigning champion, The Dark Knight\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You start in your personal Locker Room where you are safe and can familiarize yourself with the controls.\u00a0\u00a0Look around and you will see a long time member of the arena. If you have learned raw experience in the arena the bard can train you in hardened skill.\u00a0Talk to the bard and ask to train.\r\n</p>\n<p>You start with a set of attributes that make you deadly in a fight.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Agility increases your chance to dodge\r\n</li><li>Might increases your damage\r\n</li><li>Skill increases your chance to hit and damage\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>You can train in techniques to increase that deadliness.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Attack increases you chance to hit</li><li>Defense increases you chance to dodge</li><li>Sword, Mace, and Axe increase your chance to hit and defend with that weapon type</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Look around and you will see a wall with items. After each title round will be one weapon and two pieces of armor.\u00a0Grabbing the item will equip it. Once equipped it can't be removed, only replaced with a new item.\u00a0Armor includes light, medium, and heavy. each tier increases protection without any detriment. Be sure to always pick up your armor between fights.\u00a0Weapons include dagger, short sword, long sword, club, mace, war hammer, and battle axe.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use your intuition when choosing a weapon and attack type. For example War Hammers have devastating bashing attacks, but have no stab or slash damage.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use your intuition when choosing an attack on a creature. The Reaper is made of solid living wood, bashing won't be as effective as slashing and chopping. A Dark Knight in full plate will shrug off slashes.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the corner of the room is a training dummy. You can practice your attacks against the dummy. It has the \"skills\" to represent a mid level opponent in the arena.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>VR Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Motion and actions in VR can be done with gestures.\r\n</p>\n<p>Walking:\r\nWalking happens in the direction you are looking. Walk in place to advance forward to the next square. (a side to side rocking motion from shifting weight on your feet seems to work best) You can also use the left thumbstick to walk forward by pushing the thumbstick forward. Backward and Strafing Left and Right can also be controlled by the Left-Thumbstick.\r\n</p>\n<p>Waiting:\r\nUnfortunately I didn't have enough time to add a wait gesture. Please use the controller button (B)\r\n</p>\n<p>Attacking:\r\nAttacking happens in the direction you are looking.\r\n<em>Bash:</em>\u00a0Raise you right hand up and bring it down quickly in a straight line in front of you to bash.\r\n<em>Slash:\u00a0</em>Place you right hand to the left or right of your torso and swing to the opposite side while staying parallel to the ground to slash.\r\n<em>Stab:</em>\u00a0Rush your right hand forward while staying parallel to you head to stab. (make a stabbing motion in the direction you are looking\r\n<em>Grab:</em>\u00a0Put right hand forward while looking at the item to grab and make a pulling motion. (reverse stab)\r\n</p>\n<p>If you are having trouble replicating the motions try practicing in the Locker Room on the Training Dummy.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you would like to use button inputs those are supported as well:\r\n</p>\n<p>Walking:\r\nWalking happens in the direction you are looking. You can use the Left-Thumbstick to walk forward by pushing the Left-Thumbstick Forward. Backward and Strafing Reft and Right can also be controlled by the Left-Thumbstick.\r\n</p>\n<p>Waiting:\r\nPress the secondary button (B) on the right thumbstick.\r\n</p>\n<p>Attacking:\r\nAttacking happens in the direction you are looking against the enemy with the target reticle on it.\r\n<em>Bash:</em>\u00a0Push the Right-Thumbstick Backwards.\r\n<em>Slash:</em>\u00a0Push the Right-Thumbstick Left or Right.\r\n<em>Stab:</em>\u00a0Push the Right-Thumbstick Forwards.\r\n<em>Grab:</em>\u00a0Push the Primary Button (A) on the Right-Thumbstick.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls (Defaults)</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>W</strong>\u00a0Walk forward\r\n<strong>S</strong>\u00a0Walk Backward\r\n<strong>A\u00a0</strong>Strafe Left\r\n<strong>D</strong>\u00a0Strafe Right\r\n<strong>Q</strong>\u00a0Turn Left\r\n<strong>E</strong>\u00a0Turn Right\r\n<strong>X</strong>\u00a0Wait turn\r\n<strong>F\u00a0</strong>Grab / Pickup items and skills\r\n<strong>J and L</strong>\u00a0Slash attack\r\n<strong>I</strong>\u00a0Bash attack\r\n<strong>K</strong>\u00a0Stab attack\u00a0\r\nCursor Keys move menus\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game Dev and Jam Notes\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This was a lot of fun putting together. The VR aspect is really interesting. Tweaking balance is an ongoing issue and I still don't think I have it down right.\u00a0 Gestures are very fiddly to deal with.\u00a0 They work 90% of the time if you know what the gestures are looking for, but that 10% false negative is very annoying.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There are also some accessibility things I wish I could get in, like a Light/Bright Mode, and Snap Turn in VR.\r\n</p>\n<p>My 2D Text UI render is done with Canvas2D on the main thread.\u00a0 In VR a full rerender of a screen will cause frame stutter.\u00a0 In the future if I continue VR games I will need a more performant GPU rendered Text UI engine.\r\n</p>\n<p>Features did get cut as I have run out of time.\u00a0 Some notable missing features:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>VR Wait Gesture (was going to be chest thumping)\r\n</li><li>Arena themes (sewers, forest, cave)\r\n</li><li>Arena traps\r\n</li><li>Cozier Locker Room\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Bugfix and Accessibility update:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Keybind screen wasn't listing some keys properly, it now does.\r\nMouse sensitivity option wasn't displaying properly, it now does.\r\nAdded an option to enable mouse invert, mouse invert is now off by default.\r\nAdded an option to switch to a Light-Mode color scheme for the text mode ui (this isn't saved between games).\r\nLeft mouse click will now grab items and perform a random attack type on enemies.\r\nMoving while teleporting between levels could place the user outside of the level.\u00a0 Now you can no longer move while level teleport happens.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T11:07:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38b74ca19d39220df24249cbb10c5ae0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ibGoge"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
