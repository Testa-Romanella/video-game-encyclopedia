Its somewhat of a joke. well its based off of a joke anyways.\u00a0So I made a Star Wars film with my friend back in 2017. It was like shit. So recently we decided to re-make it and add lots of stuff like new characters, altered plot, etc. And I decided to make a short RPG game about it. If you wanna watch the video or look at some extra content about me, my channel, and the star wars video such as character backstories go on my website linked here.\u00a0\u00a0https://sites.google.com/view/frogohub. So yeah enjoy the game have fun, leave a review. whatever. Maybe find a way to mod the game idk. Well anyways bye.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Move - Arrow Keys</p><p>Confirm/Interact - C</p><p>Back/Cancel/Menu - X</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T17:30:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e06/e066496d6b9a94c812affabba83a23dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frogo7"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
