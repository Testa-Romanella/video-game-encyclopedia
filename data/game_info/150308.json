Well, don't! Your trusty Freezer contains enough\u00a0Junk\u00a0 fulfilling foods to keep you awake!</p>\n<p>- Will you become the Lord of Procrastinators?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>- A and D | Left and Right Movement respectively</p>\n<p>- E | Sleep in Bed (prompt)</p>\n<p>- 1, 2, 3, 4 | Respective Junk</p>\n<p>- Space | Start/ Stop Procrastinating</p>\n<p>- Any Key | Procrastinate</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong><br/>- \"Win\" does not have its own image<br/>- The Pop-Ups for winning/ losing the game don't stop the game in the background<br/>- Some sounds (mysteriously) don't play, this includes a fatigue/ death sound<br/>- No way to reset in game (my bad for this one, sorry guys :(, )</p>\n<p>The main reason there are so many issues for things such as running out of Energy or Interest or Winning the Game is due to the fact that implementing a fail state was a very late development thought and before I knew it I only had ~ 3 - 4 hours to add this feature. The only way to restart the game is by reloading the page (again sorry)</p>\n<p><strong>On a Personal Note:</strong><br/>I absolutely loved this experience. This was my very first Compo and Game in general and I had an absolute blast. From the concept to the code all the way to the \u00a31 pizza it was great fun throughout. I learned a lot from this challenge and I hope at the end of the day I can entertain you with my very janky but working game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39d37ba612bfb0f3ffce7d9aa04a81cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Call_me_Nutty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
