Sorry; I might have spent a few days just on cat legs... oops.</p>\n<p>In Level one you must find the parts required to build Winston's Return Vehicle. \u00a0It doesn't go exactly to plan, as you'll discover.\u00a0 Once assembled, use the return vehicle to get home.</p>\n<p>In Level two you will navigate the expanse between the moon and Earth; you will be required to pass through security and avoid death. My advice to you is to just keep moving.</p>\n<p><strong>You only get one life, so live it well!<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Winston is based on a real cat who was awesome and is missed; he's not\u00a0 dead, but was instead stolen slowly by another family. cos people do that now -_-</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n<p>Fixed some bugs kindly pointed out to me by <strong>kreivi</strong>!<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Added a <strong>MAP </strong>so you can find the parts more easily (not exactly a bug but certainly useful :P)</li><li>'Quit' triggering by itself (hard to reproduce, I think I got it though; used the same fix I used when 'respawn' also seemed to trigger on it's own)</li><li>Brightness toned down - I was aiming for <em>\"what the sun would be like without Earth's atmosphere\"</em> but it was just too bright.</li><li>Audio issues - again, another one that's hard to reproduce, so what I did was just pull the MP3s into Audacity, reduced the envelope size then exported to WAV - A quick playthrough suggests it's fixed - fingers crossed!</li></ul>\n<p>Big thanks to <strong>kreivi </strong>for the free playtesting!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T04:46:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1f75a81eb872e61158a7316bd045b43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["duckSPLASH"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
