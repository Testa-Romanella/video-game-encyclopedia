Upon moving abroad to upstate New York for the summer, my good friend Tyler was thrown into the fray to bring his crazy art style to the table. We worked every night\u00a0for two and a half months\u00a0from 6pm till 2am to finish the game before going our separate ways. We've loved every minute of working on the project and hope you enjoy your time playing it.</p>\n<p>Artwork - Tyler Giordano</p>\n<p>@TGiordanaught</p>\n<p>Games Design - Alex Johansson</p>\n<p>@AlexVsCoding</p>\n<p>Any donations towards the project development are graciously appreciated, but sharing the experience of playing CHIGUN with friends and family is much more valuable to us.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b875cf581ab615dea411662ca59e1146.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Alex Johansson"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
