Avoid obstacles such as pool balls, cards and coins that come raining down from above. You can roll dice as you collect them. If you're lucky you can get a powerup but keep in mind you can get unlucky.\u00a0 Chips may also fall from above, these give you extra lives.\u00a0 Try and survive the longest and get the highest score possible.</p>\n<p>Casino Cascade was made over 2 days for the GMTK 2022 Game Jam. The theme was \"Roll of the Dice\" and I incorporated it by making many aspects of the game down to random number generation and you have to roll dice to get power ups or power downs.</p>\n<p>Make sure to play the game in full screen.</p>\n<p>All art and code made by me.</p>\n<p>Good luck!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I apologize in advance for any bugs or issues you may encounter while playing my game.
