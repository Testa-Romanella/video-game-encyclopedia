Putting objects in time-loops, releasing them again if required and timing interactions correctly is the key to this puzzle game.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - walk</p>\n<p>Mouse - look</p>\n<p>Space - jump</p>\n<p>E - press button</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - toggle looping on object</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button - switch between loop lengths</p>\n<p>R - reset all loops</p>\n<p>P - show pause menu</p>\n<p>A more thorough explanation in case the tutorial does not work for you (we tried our best in the limited time, but one never knows):</p>\n<p>You can loop (almost) all interactive objects in the game: buttons, doors, pistons, conveyor belts, cubes and spheres. By looping an object, you make it repeat whatever it did in the last few seconds before you shot it. This goes on forever, until you stop the loop by shooting the object again. Looping objects will repeat every effect they caused in their loop, so buttons will continue to trigger, objects will move back and forth and doors will open and close. The length of the loop can be switched between 1s, 2s and 4s using the right mouse button. Use a combination of loops and reloops to solve the puzzles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59b/59b08e7683c7568e60401a61762760cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Zhed"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
