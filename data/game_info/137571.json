The goal is to collect 8 colour artifacts and bring them back to the main hero's love.</p>\n<p>Game mechanic is based on 20x20 tile rooms, in which both you and your enemies can move freely in all directions (no gravity). However, you can only shoot left and right. When you locate a colour artifact, you have to pick it up and carry it back to the center of the map. Should you die, the artifact returns back to where you picked it - but apart from that, you will never lose any progress. The game features a 7x7 room world, with a small 3x3 tutorial.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aea/aeac1f9bda43a2965dece6fc1fd39c6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["suve"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
