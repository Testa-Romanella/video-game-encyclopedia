I thought about how we experience the spectrum of sound and color frequencies. Low frequency sounds create lower pitches. The red end of the rainbow is made up of lower-frequency light than the purple side. Solve the VR puzzle by exploring these color and sound spectrums!</p>\n<p>Tip: Cupcakes must be ordered based on their own individual pitch. Grab a cupcake and listen! The lowest pitched cupcake will sit on the red pedestal, while the highest pitched cupcake must be placed on the purple pedestal.</p>\n<p>Tested on Oculus 2 device -\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the inner triggers to grab and the\u00a0right joystick to teleport\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T09:35:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a0a5f1ab916b7149449941754133b9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Wild Opus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
