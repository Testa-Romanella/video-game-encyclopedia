The game, which did not achieve broad commercial success, has become a cult classic among Atari enthusiasts.<br/>\n<br/>\nYars: Recharged<br/>\nYars: Recharged requires players to remain acutely aware of visual and audio cues that hint of impending danger, and to master rhythm of each boss as they navigate increasingly complex enemy defenses, all to epic soundtrack by Megan McDuffee.<br/>\nThe new game marks Atari\u2019s return to the Yars universe, which is based on Howard Scott Warshaw\u2019s classic Yars\u2019 Revenge.
