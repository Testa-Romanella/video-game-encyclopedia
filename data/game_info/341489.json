But since i put a few days of work into it, i cobbled together what i had for anyone who is curious. (So this isn't even properly structured. just a sense of what the intro could be like, then a sense of the first level. but no way to complete).</p>\n<p>The best way to sum up this game is probably:\u00a0Get ready to explode your balls into a firestorm of dust and skeletons...!</p>\n<p>Longer summary:\u00a0Although I love the EZA boys, I can't connect with their love for: Anime, Japanese RPGs, or Sports. So I thought it'd be fun to make a game that slams those 3 things together from a woefully uninformed perspective. With a dash of irresponsible politics on top. I mostly work in VR these days, so this is a Rift game. the idea is to play as 4 pro sports icons who band together to travel the world and solve important geopolitical problems. By sneaking around and killing things with their sportsings and magics. And for no reason, the whole thing is drowning in a medieval fantasy (like lord of the rings. or final fantasy and harvest moon? I haven't played those so, i dunno). On some major level, this is a love letter to suda51.</p>\n<p>(i do plan to plan to finish off at least the structure and gameloop in the coming month! if you'd like to play it later when it's complete, please leave me a note)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T05:17:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/8919017c62cbce583aa8a57c88f05782.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["warrenEBB"], "genres": ["RPG", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
