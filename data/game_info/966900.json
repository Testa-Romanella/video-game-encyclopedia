It&#39;s a remake of Hoshi wo Miru Hito, and... WHOA. What a major improvement. I mean, it&#39;s basically a totally different game! I mean, wow. Great music, graphics... and the way characters progress throughout the game is similar to the SaGa series of games, so if you&#39;re a fan of those, you&#39;ll most probably feel right at home with this.&quot;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T12:54:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a597dcf26da46146a64493f1cac93a43.jpg", "website": "http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kiss-me/aji/star/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
