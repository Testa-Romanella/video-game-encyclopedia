It is a tool to create infinite and random three-dimensional landscapes. Developed\u00a0in the Unity game engine, the bulk of the program is based on compute shaders, written in HLSL, and\u00a0executed on the GPU.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As it exists today, Angra is not a game, but a showcase of the potential of procedural generation and a foundation for other virtual experiences to build upon. The application starts by prompting a world seed from the user. The user is then loaded on a three-dimensional landscape, generated at runtime, where they can move around and explore the topology of the environment. The tool is currently capable of generating 4 different biomes, each with its unique physical characteristics. Beyond the pure act of sightseeing, players can also modify the terrain in real time, with the terraforming tool, allowing for the combination of the procedural generated and the user-created.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements:</p>\n<ul><li>16GB RAM</li><li>A great GPU (tested on a GTX 780ti and GTX 3070ti)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T11:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a79/a798e207b7cfdd6b91fd8b4e108f098c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tuniks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
