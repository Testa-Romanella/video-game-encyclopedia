Graphics demo with an interactive camera, made using the Godot Engine in about one week. Uses global illumination in Godot 3.4.2 to achieve realistic lighting, all in real time (no baked lightmaps). The character model and some assets were made with photogrammetry for the highest possible quality. </p>\n<p>Press Escape to view the options. Space to toggle cinematic camera. WASD or Arrow keys move around. Mouse to look.<br/></p>\n<p>Keep in mind, this is a high end demo and requires a modern machine  to run on the full settings. If you have a laptop or integrated  graphics, you'll likely need to reduce the settings in the menu. There  is a low spec mode for computers that are still good but only slightly  older.\r\n </p>\n<p>Launch with \"Ella.exe --preset=lowspec\" to force a graphics setting  (can also use \"ultra\", \"quality\" or \"performance\"). Presets can also be  changed in the demo menu. <br/></p>\n<p>Download for free, if you wish, but consider giving a donation if you  liked it. I paid to license the art and music, and worked on this full  time for one week. If you'd like to see more  projects like this in the future, I'd appreciate the support. Thanks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T05:32:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20a/20ac73924590114e26d362048d385957.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Andres Hernandez"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
