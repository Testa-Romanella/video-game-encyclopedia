{"id": 581590, "slug": "glass-castle", "name": "[glass castle]", "name_original": "[glass castle]", "description": "<p>Glass Castle is a short visual narrative that recounts three selected excerpts from Jeannette Wall\u2019s memoir <em>Glass Castle</em>, which accounts her immensely dysfunctional upbringing and relationship with her parents. Specifically, Jeannette\u2019s father often came up with wildly imaginative and adventurous spins to their impoverished, structureless family reality for Jeannette and her siblings. Jeannette wholeheartedly believed such explanations and interpretations of their lives as a child. In the book she recounts her gradual and aching maturation and realization\u00a0about\u00a0the truth of her father\u2019s irresponsibility, abuse, and deceit as she grew up.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This narrative traces back through three scenes of Jeannette and her father\u2019s relationship, which respectively aim to illustrate her trusting naivete and adoring idolization of her father\u00a0as a child, to denial of her father\u2019s manipulations, to ultimately disappointment and detachment. \u00a0The scenes are presented in reverse order\u00a0to better capture the more subtle, almost nostalgia of\u00a0remembering and reminiscing\u00a0this relationship in adulthood, rather than the heartbreak and anger of experiencing it in real time. There seems to almost be some universal,\u00a0bittersweet\u00a0catharsis about how, \u00a0after the dusts of pain and trauma have settled and been processed, when revisiting even the most difficult and complex of relationships, we can realize and\u00a0perhaps\u00a0still access some\u00a0moments of joy and warmth.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Acknowledgements:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shelly for visual and conceptual inspiration,\u00a0</p>\n<p>music: Song for Sienne by Brian Crain from\u00a0[https://my-free-music.icu/download/brian-crain-song-for-sienna.html]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:02:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d921b746cc512d3c461472be074d2ee3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["g.1906"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
