It is in the same universe as Vogvhathos.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>You've been tasked with collecting data on an alien planet. Choose between exploring the jungle tropics or navigating deep into the bioluminescent sea.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>Telvoikai is a role-playing game where almost every choice will affect the story. Are you a dedicated crew member, providing your team with every tidbit of data you find? Or do you discard responsibility and race to enjoy your newfound freedom on the ship? Will you choose to romance a crew member, a friend... an alien? Or ignore romance and focus on exploration and friendship?<br/>Keep an eye on the ever-changing scales of your fate, as the story has many ways it can end. Good luck!<br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>Born months apart when children are rare, your friendship with Zheng is lifelong.

Her desire to keep focused became so extreme she insisted on tech implants. <br/> <br/><br/><br/>Gaven is the ship's main doctor. As most of the ship is closely regulated, a medic is rarely needed. Out of boredom, he spent his spare time with Divyan learning environmental biology.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>Divyan works closely with Gaven on the ship's third level. She is aloof, though Gaven insists she is softer than she seems.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>Tormia's unrelenting, abrasive attitude led to her reassignment to the third floor. Refusing to accept imperfection, she is easily angered when faced with errors.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>An approved daughter of the first level, Sivel has a free run of the ship. She spends most of her time on the third level out of personal interest along with her android companion.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>Kept close to Sivel at all times, not much is known about Twenty-Two.
