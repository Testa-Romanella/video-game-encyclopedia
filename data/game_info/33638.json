FLY WITH THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD.\n<br/>\nExperience the raw emotion and harrowing danger of intense air combat over North Vietnam in this simulation based on Stephen Coonts' best-selling novel, Flight of the Intruder. The time is 1972 during the Linebacker Campaign, and the actual scenarios of this simulation have been authenticated by Vietnam pilots.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll be accompanied by as many as seven other friendlies as you catapult off the USS Shiloh and head into hostile enemy territory. Switch between any A-6 or F-4 cockpit at any time, a feature unique to Flight of the Intruder. Choose one of thirteen different daring missions OR act as Commander of the Air Group and design your own missions.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach mission is a vital part of the overall campaign and success is measured by operation completion and safe return of all aircraft. The enemy MiGs are merciless and the battles are chillingly lifelike - so real, you may wake up at night in a cold sweat.<br/>\n<br/>\nFEATURES\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pilot A-6 Intruder attack planes or F-4 Phantom II fighters (switching between planes at any time) Control up to eight friendly aircraft during one mission (four A-6 Intruders and four F-4 Phantoms) Attack thirty-four different targets</li>\n<li>Study aerial photos of target areas</li>\n<li>Manipulate sixteen variables to determine level of difficulty</li>\n<li>Execute thirteen different missions</li>\n<li>Act as Commander of the Air Group to create your own missions</li>\n<li>Switch between multiple view perspectives (inside and outside the cockpit) complete with pan and zoom</li>\n<li>Use authentic weapon systems</li>\n<li>Take video tape recorded pictures or snapshots for mission review</li>\n<li>Dodge deadly enemy anti-aircraft artillery</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T15:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe9f748cb0336ce23eced9d4d732304.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "NES", "PC"], "developers": ["Imagineering", "Spectrum Holobyte", "Rowan Software"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Atari", "MINDSCAPE", "Spectrum Holobyte", "Sphere"], "esrb_rating": null}
