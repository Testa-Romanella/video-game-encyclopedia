The goal is very simple. You have to avoid the bombs and collect the coins. Try and beat your score each time you play. This game was made with pygame and it is the first one that I ever made. I hope you enjoy the bugs and the glitches that you may encounter in game or not.</p>\n\n<p>you can find the source code at :\u00a0https://github.com/BleastT/Pygame_Engine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T09:50:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/52638088f83bc80ba8592199d5ad6851.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yassine A"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
