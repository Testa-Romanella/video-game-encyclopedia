However, your path is not easy. You have to avoid deadly mines that can blast you to the stars and back.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Blasting Courier you control a 2D top-down character. You can control that character with the WASD keys or the arrow keys. The primary goal is to reach the unique castle per level. You can also flag the mines, so you can avoid them better.<br/>\r\nA timer counts how fast you are going. The faster you go, the more high scores you make. Compete with friends and see who is the best medieval messenger.<br/>\r\nLevels are procedurally generated and only limited by the specs of your computer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you have any ideas, please visit our Discord server or our subreddit! We can talk about it and probably get it into the game.<br/>\r\nDon't forget to leave a review no matter what the rating is.
