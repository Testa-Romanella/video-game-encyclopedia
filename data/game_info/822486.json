A truck, carrying dice for the international board games competition 2022, crashed just outside your house, sending dice flying everywhere, including, to your dismay, into the bread roll. The situation seemed dicey, but luckily you had the new LaserKnife2000, a knife thin enough to cut into your bread roll without leaving a mark! Magnetic sensors on the knife are also able to determine how many dice are on each side, and the knife will automatically extract dice that it collides with. Unfortunately, The LaserKnife2000, needing a lot of energy for each cut, can only be used a limited number of times. The game ends when you have run out of cuts or successfully extracted all dice.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left arrow key - turn anticlockwise</p>\n<p>Right arrow key - turn clockwise</p>\n<p>Up arrow key - move forwards</p>\n<p>Down arrow key - move backwards</p>\n<p>Space - cut roll</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:27:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b26/b262460d713ee20630634d0e3dc4ea2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["The Great Cactus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
