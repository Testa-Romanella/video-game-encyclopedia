But not anymore.</p><p>  Our hero will try to save the city dropping his precious boomboxes filled with great tunes to soothe the angry mob of punks, rockers and the hip-hop fanatics. In his adventure, he will try to dodge the raging people wanting more music, while recovering tapes to increase his musical range. <br/></p><p>Inspired by the Beginners Circle Jam #1, we tried to make an appealing game homaging the legendary Bomberman, born in the 1980s, with a lighthearted and fun twist. We hope you enjoy the action, and end up saving the city!</p><p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Code - Fernando Gueler</p>\n<p>Art and Music - Alejandro Garc\u00eda Sainz</p>\n<p>Emotional Support - Manuel Burrell Osanz<br/></p>\n<p>Code Advisor - Pablo S\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:14:21", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArcaCrema"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
