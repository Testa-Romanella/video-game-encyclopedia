Well in my own typical fashion I procrastinated all year long, doing the whole working / being a dad thing. So with a weekend left to spare I set out to make a short and simple game. Astrofight was born! It's a throw back to the old school space shooters, but with a Nazi zombie influence.\u00a0 The game is played out in waves, each wave gets a tad bit harder. You will find pickups that are randomly dropped from downed enemies and the loot portal that spawns between waves.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game is best played with a Xbox One / 360 controller, but the old mouse and keyboard will also get the job done.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Oh and yaaaay me! For completing my new year resolution from last year! Now buy my game and make me happier! :)<br/></p>\n\n<p>Graphics by Kenney \u00a0~~~\u00a0 www.kenney.nl</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Matthew Pablo\u00a0 ~~~~ http://matthewpablo.com/<br/>Szymon Matuszewski<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80b/80beb7213e5d89862967f8e28933339a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["reckitwarehouse"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
