The narrative is that an alien spaceship has been detected orbiting a planet, with no life on board. Colony Earth Space Agency (or CESA) has sent a pilot to the area, but due to the distance of the ship from the nearest inhabited planet, the pilot was forced to leave before any information about the ship was translated and collated. CESA have managed to translate some of the operational instructions for the ship, but because of a dampening field around the alien ship, it is not possible for them to get these instructions directly to the pilot. Therefore the second player must give verbal instructions from the manual created by CESA to the pilot on board, to correct any faults that are found on the ship and enable the pilot to bring it back to the colony. Only by the two players working together will they be able to complete the mission.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c5a2feaf0b1466b7a0ae2ee6322239e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jon2mil"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
