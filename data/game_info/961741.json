I wanted to praise the games that were once popular and to reinterpret Bennett Foddy's philosophy in my own way. It's actually a game where you drag the mouse and throw the axe.<br/><br/>Why did I make this game? Time to get out of bed, modern classics that tickle your ears, piles of written code and cats, and even lovely rubber duck. I found out that a game was created that could harm people even though I just put my favorite things together. Take time to look back on your life by climbing objects that contain my wishlist to the fullest.<h3>Modern Classic Presented by Chris Zabriskie and Kevin MacLeod</h3><br/>We've prepared a two-hour piano solo that's monotonous and entertains your interests and achievements.
