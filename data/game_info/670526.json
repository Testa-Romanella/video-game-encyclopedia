It requires dexterity, tactical planning and some luck to finish all levels using no more than 7 balls per level. Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>The game is inspired by retro games such as Space Cadet, with an added twist. This game was used as submission for the Level Up Circle Hardcore Gamejam #2, with as theme \"7\" and as constraint \"pinball style\".<br/></p>\n<p>Please do let me know what you think of it in the comments, that would be highly appreciated :)<br/><br/><strong>Credit</strong> where credit is due:</p>\n<ul><li>Font: Futile Pro by somepx</li><li>Music: Space Music Packby Goose Ninja</li><li>Color Scheme: Summer Night-7 by VannuTheBoi</li></ul><p><em>IMPORTANT NOTE:</em></p><p>When in 'creator mode', you can press R to change an object's orientation, if applicable.
