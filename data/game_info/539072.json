To give the masses entertainment and hope of being elevated from their state of poverty, the governments of the world formed a \u201clottery meets Olympics\u201d, in the form of the contest called, \u201cThe Run\u201d.   In The Run, athletes are selected to navigate virtual obstacle courses, filled with deadly hazards.  The courses are so tough that people started calling the game, \u201cRun, Die, Run Again\u201d or \u201cRDRA\u201d, for short.  Eventually, The Run was renamed, to Run, Die, Run Again.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf a contestant can survive the increasingly difficult and varied courses, they win a coveted spot among \u201cThe Selected\u201d.  The Selected are given food, shelter and never have to work again.  In a world with very little light, RDRA and being \u201cSelected\u201d is like a blinding sun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Run Die Run Again, speed through stunning sci-fi obstacle courses; executing death-defying leaps, flips and dashes past deadly hazards and skirting certain-death, all with a ticking time-bomb strapped to your back!  A precision platformer built for speed freaks who want their hardcore platformers in first-person.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T02:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41e/41e86540a4f1b5d49d58d71cf4241bd6.jpg", "website": "https://www.retroninja.com/main-page", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 375, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retro Ninja"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Retro Ninja"], "esrb_rating": null}
