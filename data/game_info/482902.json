I still love it, deeply.</p>\n<p>It's kind of a \"\"\"metroidvania\"\"\", where you play a dragon and shoot at dwarves that imprisoned you in a deep cave. Kill all the dwarves to reach the end.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Have fun with it if you will !</p>\n<p>Halfondarr</p>\n\n\n<p>Note, this game was already uploaded on an old account of mine.
