Then I thought how much fun it would be to do this with a bunch of balls and started this weird project. After consulting with a few of my biology-savvy friends, I brought the project to its current stage. I will develop more. I will add new things but for now the project is as follows, it spawns in a box of 50 live ones. These creatures have their own artificial intelligence, although it is not very advanced. And these creatures reproduce, eat and move. If they don't eat, they starve, and that's how they evolve slowly. Peoples that can't evolve properly perish, and if every living thing in the game is destroyed, the game is over, but mostly they can evolve to certain degrees. If you are bored and want to experience this strange experiment. Download it and start watching. You can change some things if you want. So that's it for now. You can join our discord server or reddit community to help improve it.
