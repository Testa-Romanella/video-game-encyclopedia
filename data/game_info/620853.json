The breakthrough came when the meat was bestowed with intelligence and a sense of altruistic benevolence. For years this new brand of intelligent meat would roam Earth efficiently converting less palatable resources (such as plastic waste)\u00a0into delicious t-bone steaks! When they came across a human in need, they would selflessly pull off parts of their being to provide a succulent meal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It seemed like world peace was at hand! Alas, no good deed goes unpunished, and the aching\u00a0jealousy of a newly ostracized group\u00a0flashed over into violence. Nobody had expected the cows to strike back against the new line of lab-grown meats! They were bitter about the loss of their best line of work\u00a0(they too had been genetically augmented with an altruistic drive to feed the world), and then chose to lash out the only way they knew how:\u00a0with their fission powered laser eyes.</p>\n<p>Indeed, you\u00a0are a writhing sentient mass of lab-grown meat, and it is your duty to survive the increasingly intense waves of bovine terrorism.<br/></p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Point and click to frisbee\u00a0a T-bone steak\u00a0with lethal force.</p>\n<p>Dead cows drop fresh steaks.</p>\n<p>Walk over fresh steaks to\u00a0replenish your body.</p>\n<p>If you get hit by a cow's laser blast, one of your steaks will get cooked and fall away.</p>\r\nTied\u00a0Together\r\n<p>Developer's statement on the thematic applicability of\u00a0<em>An Honest Misteak</em>:\u00a0In this game I tied together two distinct resources: health and ammunition.
