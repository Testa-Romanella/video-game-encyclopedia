With a plan which no one thought possible. The french successfully managed to send the first radio operated robots on the moon, also known as the queen of all cheese. For 2 years now those robots have been harvesting cheese, controlled by operators in Lyon, you play as one of them.</p>\r\nMore :\r\n<p>This game was created for the 49th edition of the Ludum Dare. My goal with this project was to create a game that could be played using only one button. Since it's a jam and I started kinda late, it's more an experiment then a game really. Though I'm really pleased with the final result. I did have a lot more ideas for other interactions and different commands,etc.. but that might be for another time.<br/><br/>This game was entirely made on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, using the Godot Engine.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/513/5131e05ad7483d87d5155a71554df8ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SukkoyF"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
