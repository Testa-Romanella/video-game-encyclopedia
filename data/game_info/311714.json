(RTS-R)<br/><br/>And what is RTS-R you ask?<br/>Designed with Esports at its core. This is future vehicle technologies capable of 1,000+km/h built upon simulated physics with track capture, resource collection, mid-race vehicle upgrades and track abilities. All played out on extreme full 360 degree track designs and an online racing tournament complete with prizes.<br/><br/><strong>DESIGN BACKGROUND</strong><br/>Did you ever hear that an F1 car could theoretically drive upside down?<br/>https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/inside-f1/understanding-f1-racing/Aerodynamics.html<br/>Well, we tested it, and proved it. But it wasn't fun to drive, so we took it a few steps further and developed a fully adaptable vehicle setup ecu that could adjust; Aerodynamics, camber, toe, spring compression, tyre pressure, etc based on the vehicles velocity and orientation.<br/><br/>Trust us, that little bit extra downforce when you're upside down comes in handy ;)<br/>Welcome also to 'Future Physics Racing'!<br/><br/><strong>TECHNOLOGY:</strong><br/>We built our own proprietary engine \u2018RevGen\u2019 so that we could make this possible by giving you the high frame and physics rates needed for a silky smooth physics handling experience at these insanely high speeds.<br/><br/><strong>GAME MODDING:</strong><br/>We also have plans to open 22RS up to game modding and community built assets. So if you have some ideas for future physics racing vehicles, you can make them, if you have some ideas for some fully 3d track designs that you'd like to try out, you can build them, or if you want to take our suite of physically based vehicles (did we mention we support bikes and maglev?) and unique strategy elements and make something unique of your own, then we want to help you make that happen.<br/><br/><strong>RELEASE:</strong><br/>We\u2019re currently preparing for closed beta, and aim to launch into early access around Q1-Q2 2020. Stay tuned for more info ...<br/><br/>Add \u201822 Racing Series\u2019 to your Wishlist to get notified when we launch.<br/><br/>* Try in VR with our six axis motion simulation support if you dare", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e3/5e3dd47ea6bd23be84dea26acb43a52a.jpg", "website": "http://www.22racingseries.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 460, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GOATi Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GOATi Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
