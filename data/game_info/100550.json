He must escape from the magical forest and find his way home. The only way out is to use the portal gates, but they are not easy to reach. Will you help the old man to get out of the forest? <br/> <br/><strong>Bunnyrama</strong> is a puzzle adventure game where your goal is to lead the old man through the magical forest full of huge bunnies.
