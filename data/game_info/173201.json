I didn't discover it until about a week and a half before the due date or I'dve probably done a better job. Basic combat/levelling works but there are no drops or trades or anything yet, and the map itself it pretty boring.</p>\n<p>Please read the Readme on the project Github page for information on running/connecting to this game.</p>\n<p>That said, place names are procedurally generated as is the terrain. The road unfolds ahead of you as you explore.</p>\n<p>I'll keep working on this after the jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/887/887f3fee98d133d4a147cad868556bfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jason Scheirer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
