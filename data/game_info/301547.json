These tasks are simplified in a manner that is enjoyable for all ages. The gameplay environment was modeled in co-operation with the Museum of Technology and the Finnish museum association to match 1960\u2019s Finland as closely as possible. All of the models were made by in-house graphical artists and reviewed for authenticity by the museums\u2019 history professionals.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers are tasked to fix ESKO\u2019s central processor by changing broken electron tubes, writing code on a punch paper, and inserting it into a code reader. If the code is written successfully, a miniature cannon will fire upon one of the three targets. The ESKO game incorporates a simplified version of the actual programming, where the players have to pull a lever and play a mini game instead of actually punching holes in a sheet of paper.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e96/e9685f9897dabe5497fb220b427dbd3e.jpg", "website": "https://cse.fi/referenssit/esko/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kajaani University of Applied Sciences", "Clever Simulation Entertainment", "Finnish Museum Association", "The Museum of Technology"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Clever Simulation Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
