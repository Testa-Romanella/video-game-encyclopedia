I got worried that people did not want to interact with me, as if I was some kind of nuisance. I was still aware thtat this was probably false, but it caused me to spiral slightly, as I didn't want to \"bother\" anyone about what upset me.</p>\n<p>This all culminated in the events of last week's saturday night, which I felt compelled to put in audiovisual form as a way of expressing what it was like without having to rely only on words. It's not a very polished experience, as it reflects the mental state I was in when I started working on it.<br/></p>\n<p>Now, I understand this isn't for everyone... But if anyone out there has a clue how these events should be called (maybe some sort of psychosis? idk), please let me know what you think it is/might be!</p>\n\n<p>You can hold the mouse button to make the dialogue speed up, btw<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T07:04:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc183ba0ab6a7ab3c475717aa8a3045.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lushawastaken"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
