Here are some explanations to the mechanics:</p><p><strong>Homing</strong>: An arrow will follow the first enemy, which gets near the arrow, until it hits the enemy. If the enemy dies before the arrow can hit the enemy, the arrow will continue its flight in a straight line and will choose a new target when ever it can.</p>\n<p><strong>Pierce meaning</strong>: After damaging an enemy if the projectile can pierce, it will go through the enemy and will be able to damage other enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Chain meaning</strong>: After damaging an enemy if the projectile can chain, it will continue its flight towards the closest enemy. If no enemies left to chain towards the arrow will choose a random direction. An arrow can not chain to an enemy it already damaged.</p>\n<p><strong>An arrow will always try to chain first and then pierce if it can't chain.</strong>\u00a0An arrow can only damage the same enemy once.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T16:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f37/f370d29266979797126c19edc3b83252.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CustomEyeStudio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
