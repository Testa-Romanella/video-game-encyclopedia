Try to grab 5 of the same grub in a row for a perfect bonus!\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Keep an eye out for the rare heart and star power-ups. Snag a star to gain temporary invincibility for the round or capture a heart for an extra life!\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Get hurt by the spike balls and you lose a life. Get hit enough times though, and your game is over!\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Snack Scoffer was created solely by Niall Chandler\u00a0in the Pico-8 game engine. I had a lot of fun making the game, learning many things about game development and programming in the process.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback about the game, then by all means give it. I'd love to hear it, and I'd love to thank you so much for playing my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T08:18:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3ad510d221d452e9d196da081f5e1324.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Niall Chandler Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
