What triggered this change? Genetic mutation? Probably not. Our brains and anatomy have remained relatively unchanged for 4 million years. An encounter with different hominid species? Perhaps...<br/><br/>Play solo against AI, with others locally or against other players online. This digital version of the board game Neanderthal also includes an introductory tutorial to the game which will make it easier to learn Neanderthal. Useful both for playing the app and for when you want to play the physical version of the game.<br/><br/>This is a thematic game where you as a player, will play through the critical epoch during which this change occurred. After millions of years of an uninterrupted, modest nomadic existence, we suddenly developed complex language, began forming tribes and building villages. You play as one of the human species existing at that time. The game system enables you to follow your tribe's evolution as well as that of the environment in which you live. The three players you can represent are the Archaic Man (Player Green), Neanderthal (Player Yellow), and Cro-Magnon (Player Red) species fighting to survive in Europe during the last glacial maximum from 45,000 to 35,000 years ago. You begin the game vocal (i.e. words for speech but not ideas) and with a sexuality (promiscuous, harem, or pair bonding).<h3> NEANDERTHAL SEQUENCE OF PLAY </h3>(six phases per turn)[<br/><br/>1.
