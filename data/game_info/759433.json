The twisting passages shift and change behind you; as if they were a living creature just out of sight. You can drop lamps to light up the way, but be careful as the dust kicked up by your lamps can break other lamps. And remember that\u00a0no matter how hard you search, there is only more cave. The darkness always wins.</p>\n<p>Written and developed by Starla Insigna.<br/></p>\n<p>The soundtrack, \"Exploration\", was composed by Starla Insigna &amp; Emily Winds.<br/></p>\n<p>Audio Engine: FMOD Studio by Firelight Technologies Pty Ltd.<br/>Tileset: 16x16 Top-down Tileset by runninblood<br/>Sprites and sounds: CanariPack 8BIT TopDown by Canary Games<br/>Player sprite: World of Solaria by jamiebrownhill<br/>Fonts: Pixel Fonts by ChevyRay<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys / WASD to move<br/><space> to drop a lamp or read signs<br/><esc> to open\u00a0the menu</esc></space></p>\n<p>(macOS version currently requires macOS 10.13 or later)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T10:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc9eeb3b4af20b303e5c6d56330e5f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["hatkirby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
