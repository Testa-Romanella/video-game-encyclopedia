Start off with a randomly generated character and upgrade her through chests found on floors and powerups found in the falls between, all the while collecting as much gossamer as you can, using some as ammunition to defeat threats.</p>\n<p>Also features a dynamic soundtrack that fades tracks in and out for each floor and fall, because I'm an idiot and decided that a time-constrained game jam was the first time to experiment with it.</p>\n<p>Created for\u00a0#LOWREZJAM 2018.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Left/Right/Up/Down: Move<br/>Space: Fire at nearest enemy (if one exists)<br/>R (on character generation screen): Reroll<br/>Alt+Enter (Win EXE): Switch to windowed (due to a glitch\u00a0I could not fix for the life of me, this starts out looking awful, but the window can be resized)<br/>Esc: Quit game</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Programming: NAL<br/>Graphics: NAL<br/>Fonts: NAL<br/>Music: NAL<br/>Wait, everything: NAL</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3f/d3fe3f58925a3907d1671128b92a5826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Chequered Ink"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
