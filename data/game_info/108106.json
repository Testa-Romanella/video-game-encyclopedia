From\r\nTheir hands sprang forth life; from Their imagination, a purpose for that life.\r\nUnder the guidance of the Four Gods, the land flourished. The people used Their\r\ngenerous gifts to cultivate the land, to raise mighty kingdoms, and to live\r\namong one another in peace and harmony.</em><em>However, this era of\r\nprosperity was not to last. From the depths of darkness rose an aberration -\r\nthe Dark One, a being which embodied the antithesis of all that the Four Gods\r\nhad wished for: Pain. Loneliness. Hatred. Fear. Despair. In its malice and\r\ndepravity, it clawed its way to the top of Turovero, a tower which rose\r\nendlessly to the gates of Heaven, before usurping the throne of the Gods at its\r\nsummit and casting Them away.<br/></em><br/><em>Under the influence of\r\nthe Dark One, the people now knew true despair. The land grew barren, the\r\nkingdoms waged war, and society began its slow descent into destruction. To\r\nthis day, no one knows for certain what happened to the Four Gods who gave life\r\nto our world.<br/></em><br/><em>Yet not all hope is\r\nlost. Even now, the Celestial Tower still stands, waiting for its chosen\r\nwarriors to free it from the Dark One\u2019s grasp.
