Characters start gaining skills on LVL 3</p>\n<p>2. El Jayyed gets supports skills. His \"Wide range\" ability makes item effect spread to other party members, but only in battle.</p>\n<p>3. Shini gets damage skills. His normal attack gives him a stacking buff. Utilizing his normal attack buff with his special skills makes him dangerous in battle.</p>\n<p>3. Dream gets magic abilities. She starts off with a single target magic attack, and then gets a stronger magic that hits all enemies. Her normal attack is weaker than the others' but she gains MP with each attack.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/642/642cc13c187d16b3565855ab9847ab6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eljayyed"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
