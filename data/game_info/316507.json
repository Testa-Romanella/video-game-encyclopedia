I've started many projects but never finished any. I wanted to work on something simple from start to finish, doing as much of it as possible myself to learn more about game development.\u00a0 I was inspired by the game play of simple air-hockey games, but wanted to add a little extra game play and theme wise, hence the space wizard theme.<br/><br/>It's taken me a long while, and it's still not \"finished\" but I'm happy with how it stands currently and hope others can get some entertainment out of it :3 It's a good mindless time passing game if you've got a few minutes to spare.<br/></p>\n<p>Depending on my free time moving forward, I may implement a better enemy AI, since this one is fairly janky, and may also include some background music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e8/9e83d0726579227881b4220d6a73d82e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carbon Shouka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
