(Renewal)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Boon Ming is a hard-working grab delivery rider, as the covid restrictions ease, he finds roads and streets renewed with crowds of people! Can he complete enough orders to get by the day with these newfound challenges?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>2. What sort of experience/message are you hoping your game will bring across to the player?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Throughout this game, players have to complete the word as fast as possible and they would be \"rated\" based on their performance, hopefully, the players would show a new appreciation for grab riders who worked day and night to deliver food to our doorstep!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>3. Why did you end up choosing the direction of your game?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We choose GrabFood as our main direction as the riders are commonly found on the road or walkways hard at work delivering food for people and as covid restrictions ease up, these riders have to tackle higher traffic and denser crowds, which allowed us to gain a newfound respect for these hard-working hustlers!</p>\n<p><strong>Player Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Use your keyboard as input to\u00a0guide Boon Ming to collect bags of food!\r\n</li><li>Boon Ming can only move\u00a0<strong>Horizontally</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Vertically</strong>.\r\n</li><li>Each round will last for one hour!
