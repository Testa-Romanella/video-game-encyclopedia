Has a basic attack and a magic one. The health bar shows half and full hearts and adds another if the player finds a heart container. The magic bar regenerates and the blobs have a 50% chance of dropping a random potion.</p>\n<p>The \"plot\" of the game is that the mage is trying to escape the dungeon after everyone disappeared, trying to follow the theme of the jam: \"free\".  Ironically, there is no way right now to get out of the dungeon.</p>\n<p>KNOWN BUG:</p>\n<p>If you talk to the guy in the cell twice the game will softlock. I spent most of the last day trying to fix it but I only got a headache. They just hate me, its literally their fault that the mage can't escape.<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<ul><li>I heavily relied on the Godot tutorial made by Davide Pesce so most of what I did was to read the documentation on the things he showed.</li><li>The font used is 16bfZX by petrnita on BitFontMaker2</li><li>The intro and death music is \"In Dreams\" By Three Chain Links\u00a0CC BY 3.0</li><li>The in game music is \u201cMisty Cave\u201d, from PlayOnLoop.com CC BY 4.0</li><li>Sound effects from Media College</li><li>The tileset is edited from Roguelike Cave &amp; Dungeons pack by Kenney Vleugels</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T06:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f83063ccba2109df0c5b1107f33aedf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BigSpaceWorm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
