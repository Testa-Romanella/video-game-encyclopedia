As it is, it's unfinished and the game's story isn't shown anywhere, so I'll tell it here:</p>\r\nYou died and then Death resurected you as an axolotl. But it wasn't for free! Now you are in debt and have to pay with the souls of immortal beings (plus interests every thirty seconds). \r\n<p>Originally the game was going to have 4 enemies (zombies, demons, lichs and shadow figures) plus a vampire boss and a lot of different bubbles and upgrades.</p>\n<p>Alas, the game has only 4 types of bubbles, one enemy (zombies) and a shop. Also simple procedural dungeons and some stats. The game doesn't even feature Lizzie (Death) :(<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>asdf to move<br/>left click to shoot<br/>right click to absorb<br/>mouse wheel to scroll bubbles<br/>f11 for fullscreen (broken)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c12/c12d979b95ffc9628181c3173d689938.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["remruts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
