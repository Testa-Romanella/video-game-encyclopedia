This is harder than it seems because a gang called the Coffee Criminals have invaded the building and want to prevent Mr. Hart from drinking tea. Mr Hart has the upper hand though; he has a fully tactical\u00a0teleporting gun! It is a regular gun that can be used to shoot and kill, but Mr Hart is connected to the gun in such a way that he is teleported to\u00a0wherever the bullets land! Help Mr Hart use his teleporting gun\u00a0to escape the complex and\u00a0and get some lovely soothing\u00a0 tea!</p>\n\n<p>This game was created in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2021. The Game Jam\u00a0theme was \"Connected Together\". So, my game concept is a top-down roguelike game where the gun and the player are \"connected together\" in a way that allows the player to teleport with the rounds fired from the teleporting gun.</p><p>The font asset that was used in the game:\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/fonts/free-pixel-font-thaleah-140059\r\n</p>\n<p>NOTE - If the web version isn't working, please try the downloadable files.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:16:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e2/5e24c0067806ea1af9992a3787643059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Trumpet_Weasel"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
