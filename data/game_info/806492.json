You can do this by clicking on transparent walls that are not solid. Once clicked on with the left mouse button, these walls will become solid and are able to alter the course of the ball. If you want to make the walls not solid, click on them with the right mouse button. Click on the correct walls to get the ball into the goal. If you fail to get the ball into the hole, the level will restart and you will have to try again. As you go through each level, different types of obstacles appear such as spikes that the ball can't go through and walls that can only be activated once a certain amount of walls are solid. Do your best to complete all the levels.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Music by Harveer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T23:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f7/3f7575b237dffb4796f6489e8d2b57c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ian.Games6"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
