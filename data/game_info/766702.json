It\u2019s the only plant that you\u2019ve ever grown well\u2026 but in this case, it\u2019s a real money tree; and it\u2019s your own source of income!\r\n</p>\n<p>Your goal is to keep the tree alive as long as possible. As the tree grows, upkeep costs will become more and more steep, since the tree requires more and more water, food and light to survive. Upgrade the pot to let the tree grow larger, but be wary: More limbs means more to feed!\r\n</p>\n<p>Features complete saveable options, high scores, and more. Compete against yourself or other jammers to get the longest uptime on your money tree before you inevitably go bankrupt.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Pay close attention to your Tree Monitor. You can see the decay stat, which is how much health is drained per second, and the heal rate\u2013 shown as a composite number\u2013 which shows how much you\u2019re healing plus decaying. If you can get this number into the positive, you should be able to survive a while.\r\n</p>\n<p>Cutting too much from one base branch will yield that branch unusable forever!\r\n</p>\n<p>Everything you do might push you closer to destruction.\r\n</p>\n<p>Either way\u2026 you have to prune the money tree.\r\n</p>\n<p>ATTENTION: For Mac OS builds, please refer to this page:\u00a0https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50577473/unity-game-compiled-in-windows-doesn-t-open-in-mac\r\n</p>\n<p>Screenshots below:\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T18:36:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e8/5e8a0af22ce655b90919eba6eacd3f0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Orionhart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
