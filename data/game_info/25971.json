Use the Nintendo DSi Stylus to cut and then manipulate the paper into a box shape. Be careful though: if you\u2019re not efficient with your cuts, you\u2019ll waste paper and be penalized. R&amp;D mode teaches you new patterns and then challenges you to complete various ranks, while FACTORY mode gives you the chance to earn money by making as many boxes as possible from an endless sheet of paper.</p>\n<p>Success in each mode brings its own reward: clear ranks to be promoted and change your character\u2019s appearance and use your earnings to acquire new items for your character\u2019s miniature garden. With its stylish graphics and catchy sound, you may just find that thinking inside the box isn\u2019t such a bad<br />\nthing sometimes!</p>\n<p>Games in the Art Style series feature elegant design, polished graphics, and pick-up-and-play controls, creating an experience focused purely on fun and engaging game play.</p>\n<p>Check out more Art Style games!</p>\n<p>For WiiWare:<br />\nArt Style: CUBELLO<br />\nArt Style: light trax<br />\nArt Style: ORBIENT<br />\nArt Style: ROTOHEX<br />\nArt Style: Rotozoa</p>\n<p>For DSiWare:<br />\nArt Style: AQUIA<br />\nArt Style: DIGIDRIVE<br />\nArt Style: BASE 10<br />\nArt Style: precipice<br />\nArt Style: Zengage<br />\nArt Style: PiCTOBiTS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T19:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e58b15d8e2c984e3026be58df425db2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS", "Nintendo DSi"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
