Third week running? That almost smells like commitment.</p>\n<p>--THIS WEEK--</p>\n<p>I was given:</p>\n<p>Rude word generator\u00a0- @emmaahume\r\n</p>\n<p>Sleeping - @antlerdads\r\n</p>\n<p>Moisturiser and\u00a0Coffee\u00a0- @Sasha_Harvey</p>\n<p>Text to Speech-\u00a0 @TomFrostCreates</p>\n<p>Intentional bad colour coordination\u00a0- @MordanonVihl</p>\n<p>Avocados, tinsel, mermaids - @_hollyrebecca</p>\n<p>Sad Raccoons - @roseybit</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>You run a spa. A spa for a town of raccoons! Usually this is great, but today something terrible has happened. Someone has activated a rude word generator right in the middle of town, and it's insulting raccoons! The spa is so packed that raccoons are coming in and sleeping behind raccoons that are ordering! It's your job to make sure the raccoons get what they want so they can be happy, and deflect all of those mean things being said.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouse - Drag objects, delete bad words</p>\n<p>Game:</p>\n<p>Drag the things raccoons want onto their heads to serve them. If you're too slow they'll leave. To serve coffee/tea, grab a mug and move it over the coffee machine/teabags. If you get the wrong thing let go of the mouse to drop it. Click bad words to get rid of them, if they get too close to raccoons you lose points.</p>\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<p>If the raccoon only wants 1 thing it will display an avocado at the bottom. I have no idea why, they don't want it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out my wak shit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T03:14:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d564dfce2e4b10ddab8c977e06e36c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan Ryan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
