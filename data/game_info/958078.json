So he made this game. It kinda sucks. I guess it was better at the time. He also thought more people would download it if they confused it with the popular RPG series Fallout, which did not pay off in the long run.</p>\n<p>The game is basically Pong for people without friends, or Breakout for people who are allergic to blocks (or both (it depends on your perspective)). It has some sick powerups and weirdly still very nice looking dynamic 2D raytraced lights. Like fr it actually looks kinda dope. Note that the screenshots are of the 1.0 version where the ball and paddle are white, but in this version they are black. I just didn't feel like making new screenshots.<br/></p>\n<p>In 2018 the app was removed from the Google Play store never to be found again, because I'm lazy and lost the source code and didn't feel like supporting later android versions. But now it's finally back exclusively on itch.io. Wowzers!!!<br/></p>\n<p>Surprisingly it still works on Android 13. You might have to allow unknown sources and skip the virus warning popup, but it does work.</p>\n<p>I think it had an online leaderboard, which does not work anymore, and the stuff that keeps track of your highscore also doesn't work and also there's supposed to be some text that pops up when you grab a powerup, but come on, those lighting effects are effin ballin fam.</p><p>It's time to go balls out!
