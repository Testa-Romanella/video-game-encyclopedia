Like the feeling when you beat a friend?</p>\n<p>Lazer of death combines simple mechanics, addictive gameplay, and bad spelling to make the ideal game when you have just two minutes break between two appointments.</p>\n<p>The point of the game is to kill as many shapes as possible within one minute, and collect the coins they drop. However, watch out! There are a lot of shapes on the screen, many move fast, and every type has different abilities. If you get killed by a shape, you loose points, but you get transported to the special death bonus world, where you can attempt to get back some of your points, until you get killed again and transported back. At the end of a minute, the game ends and your score is added to the highscore list.</p>\n<p>The game has awsome music by Kevin McLoyd, procedually generated sound effects, even the music parts are a entertainment in it self. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4a/a4abe53babe558772737fdd545c83f1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mousetail"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
