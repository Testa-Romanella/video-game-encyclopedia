Collect the rare powercell from the military complex at the end to use the powers for yourself and return to get picked up!</p>\n<p>The majority of the voxel assets were from various packs voxel packs by Max Parata. I used Voxel Robot Assets Free, Voxel Cyberpunk City, and Shopping Mall. I also used an asset from Voxel Vehicle Assets by Felix Strefter. The UI icons were either made by me or gotten from Shutterstock, the battery and flame icon were from Shutterstock. Car and siren sounds were from YouTube Audio Library. I made the rest of the sound effects myself. The first song that plays is Fast and Run by Nico Staf and the second song is Kreuzberg Nights by FutureMono. Special thanks to Paranoid Wallet for emotional support and consulting during development.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T08:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/119ea8cff7717aaf3f74e404743d5af7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlamingMonkay"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
