These cults, along with any that you create, can be played where you attempt to gain more and more followers on a map of the U.S. with the 1980 population of the U.S. You will have to contend with FBI investigations along your way to convert the entire country and seek to accomplish your endgoal, ranging from revolution against the \"Establishment\" to ascension.
