Armed with a blank map, your trusty lute, and various magical tunes (one of which allows you to flip your own gravity and traverse between worlds)\u00a0you must mark 12 important landmarks across both worlds with the only thing to go off of being vague descriptions of the landmarks themselves. While not without its dangers, The Upside is a land of prospering growth and life whereas The Downside, on the other hand, is home to much hostility; the acidic waters will send you running back to a safe point (where you started) if touched, so keep your distance! While you can swim, you happen to be deathly afraid of the ocean, so if you end up in the sea, just tread water until you can flip gravity or use a phantom tune to escape the depths!</p>\n<p><strong>Other details about how to play are detailed below and in the game itself:</strong></p>\n<p>You know four magical tunes to help you traverse the two worlds: one which puts enemies to sleep for a short time, one which doubles your own speed for a short time, one which allows you to become a phantom and slip through all collisions for a brief moment, and one which allows you to flip your own gravity and traverse between the two worlds. Something inaccessible in one realm? Swap to the other!</p>\n<p>You must drag and drop the landmarks to the locations as you identify them in the world on your map. To help with navigation, you can also place path and water markers to your heart's content. pressing space swaps between maps of the upside and the downside, a circle marker represents your current location and a diamond marker represents your location in the other world if you were to flip gravity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T06:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29eeb155588ba6bccd412f4adf2bdbb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["InsanePig"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
