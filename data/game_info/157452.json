The best description would be to say, it is a mix between Rubik's Cube and Jigsaw puzzle. The goal of the game is to put together the image which is randomly scrambled in the beginning sequence, trying to keep number of moves smallest possible. Current version has ten levels, in each level adjacent cubes are geared to each other using different patterns. Depending on the level, problem can be quite easy or extremely difficult.  Great to test and train memory and combinatorial skills, easy to play but not always easy to solve.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50e/50ea59046fab3c5ecc67edc8f8a40803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zzarkov"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
