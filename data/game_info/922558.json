You'll be fine.<br/></p>\n<p>Separate your ship to reveal your laser and vaporize oncoming space junk. You can stretch your laser to the limits to knock off multiple asteroids, but be careful \u2014 if the laser durability hits 0, you won't be able to destroy anything. (Besides Earth. Inadvertently.)</p>\n<p>Bring the ship back together to repair the laser as often as possible, and you'll keep everyone on earth safe and alive! For now!</p>\n<p>This is my very first game, an entry into the GDevelop Game Jam #3. I\u00a0hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Liluo link:\u00a0https://liluo.io/olsugarbread/asteroid-janitor-o-714</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T07:51:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c6/1c6841f9ef6a7cc02da4f45e0f64a077.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ol' Sugarbread"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
