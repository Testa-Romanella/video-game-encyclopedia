I hope you enjoy the demo and eventually the full version. In the previous version the base mechanics were implemented but now\u00a0 there is plenty more.</p>\n<p>The Alpha Particle demo is now version 2 and many additions and changes have been made. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>List of changes:<br/></strong>-Improved fonts<br/>-Difficulty setting added<br/>-Vending machine added with various items to purchase<br/>-Added multiple abilities but only one available for demo (Firewalk)<br/>-Added abilities to some player particle systems but only one available for demo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Fired)<br/>-Added 10 playable levels for demo that brings the total to 28 playable levels<br/>-Improved tutorials<br/>-Improved performance<br/>-Improved graphics<br/>-More enemies added<br/>-Improved first Boss<br/>-Adjusted traveling costs (cost less now)<br/>-Added secret areas (Can you find them haha?)<br/>-Random enemy grouped spawns<br/>-Boost is now free at stations and portals<br/>-Improved audio<br/>-Various glitches fixed</p>\r\nDeveloper\r\n<p>The game is developed by Bruce Nicou (function unknown) and is being developed in South Africa.<br/></p>\r\nDemo feature\r\n<p>The demo has the complete first station (Antapex station)\u00a0including the level boss! The first station is essentially the tutorial of the game.\u00a0The demo\u00a0also includes 9 levels from the next station (Equinox station) and 8 levels of the third station (Periapsis station). A vending machine has been added with various items to buy including a player particle system (Fired), an ability (Firewalk), and positively charged energy capsules. Hidden areas have also been added with bonus items hidden inside. <br/></p>\r\nMinimum specification\r\n<p>At this point the game has not yet been tested on different machines so specs have\u00a0not yet been set. Any feedback on machine details and performance would be appreciated.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Currently the game supports keyboard and game pad inputs. Gamepad is highly recommended as it features 360 degree movement and vibration which the keyboard does not.\u00a0</p>\r\nFuture developments\r\n<p>The game is being developed in a freeform manner meaning features get implemented into the game that feels right at the time rather than having it all planned out from the start. This means it is a little hard to say exactly what is coming or going to happen. However there is a list of things that I would like to implement but not everything on the list will be used necessarily.</p>\n<p>The list (Not all items may be implemented\u00a0): (Edit: This list got a lot smaller! :])<br/></p>\n<p>-Enemy bios</p>\n<p>-A story\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>-More enemies and bosses (definite)</p>\r\nPlease help!\r\n<p>This is the second version of the game demo and it is still in development. Bugs are likely to pop up and the more you report these bugs the more it will be likely the bugs will be fixed.\u00a0I would like to know how the game performs on different machine specs as well.</p>\r\nLinks\r\n<p>Facebook: www.fb.com\\aparticle</p>\r\nContact\r\n<p>Any correspondence can be done directly from this page via a post, the facebook page or by email.</p>\n<p><strong>function.unknown@gmx.com</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d98/d989698e5829ded6268c19ba028e00c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["function.unknown"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
