As for 7dfps I don't mind, because I do think I capture the general movement feel of a fast paced old school fps (even though it doesn't have view bobbing ;) ), which to me is more important than the shooting.<br/>As for procjam: I want to generate more interesting levels, and all of the ground work is in there, so maybe look out for a future update!<br/></p>\n<p>If the unicode game name causes problems on your system, I'm sorry, please tell me and I'll upload a different build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T03:55:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47b/47be4d7a935accc7674ea9df4ba76ec7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nils"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
