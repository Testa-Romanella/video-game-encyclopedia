Huge overworld, eight dungeons, seven playable characters and lots of Zelda weapons and items. This is an open game like the original legend of Zelda, where you can wander anywhere and take the dungeons in any order.</p>\n<p>After the fall of Hyrule and death of the King and Queen, Princess Zelda and her friend Link set out on a quest to recover the lost Triforce of Wisdom and take down Ganon (like you do). There are also multiple unlockable characters found in the game, and the game is Xbox controller compatible. I hope you all enjoy it.\r\n</p>\n<p>*** There's a known error in that it sometimes freezes for no reason, but the game saves frequently, so you can just start where you left off.\r\n</p>\n<p>-----------------Controls (keyboard)---------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>Arrows -- move\r\n</p>\n<p>D -- attack\r\n</p>\n<p>S -- special weapon\r\n</p>\n<p>X -- block\r\n</p>\n<p>C -- change characters\r\n</p>\n<p>Q E -- change item\r\n</p>\n<p>Tab -- change camera angle\r\n</p>\n<p>----------------Controls (gamepad)----------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>Stick/arrows -- move\r\n</p>\n<p>X -- attack\r\n</p>\n<p>A -- block\r\n</p>\n<p>B -- special weapon\r\n</p>\n<p>Y -- change character\r\n</p>\n<p>Shoulder -- change item\r\n</p>\n<p>Select -- change camera angle\r\n</p>\n<p>Esc to exit\r\n</p>\n<p>P to take a screenshot\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T08:10:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bd5a515722bcc48eb20843192a2a0e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lierniwait"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
