{"id": 666102, "slug": "crystasis-ii", "name": "CRYSTASIS II", "name_original": "CRYSTASIS II", "description": "A Game By Its Cover\u00a0is an annual game jam about turning the fictional cartridge art of the\u00a0My Famicase Exhibition\u00a0into the real thing.\r\nThe inspiration I have used with permission from the artist is Crystasis. The game that I have made is a sequel to this. I figure that I probably can't make something good enough to meet someone's dream expectations yet. I am still learning. Sequels are usually not as good as the first. So I can manage your expectations here.\r\n\r\nCrystasis\r\nWith the Crystarium gone, everything is frozen in time. Try and free the world from this crystal stasis it is doomed to be held within.\r\n\r\n<strong>Crystasis II\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>The Sequel\u00a0</strong>\r\n30 years ago you saved the world from a crystal stasis that would have frozen the entire planet forever. Time has flowed as it should since the great Crystarium imbalance. Or has it? Stay alive as you figure out what happened in this mind bending sequel to the all time classic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am limiting the screenshots due to there being a few surprises in here. This is free. It was fun to make. I hope you have some fun playing it.\r\nThis is best played with a control pad on a windows machine that has a graphics card than can handle more than 4 colours. If you are reading this far, this game has more than 4 colours! There are 26 Dogs to save in Crystasis II. Can you save them all?
