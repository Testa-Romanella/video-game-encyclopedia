Attach all parts to the body to win.</p>\n<p>angles work best around 45, force works best around 100 (give or take, each body part is a different mass, so fiddle around)</p>\n<p>Use the reset button if you miss.</p>\n<p>TriJam 68.9 entry, hence the bad UI and\u00a0I\u00a0hit the 3 hour time limit\u00a0for the TriJam ... so didn't get to implement any sound effects (sad donkey noise), and didnt get a change to make the UI easier. Spending 45 minutes just on chopping up a graphic in GIMP is probably not good use of my time.</p>\n\n<p>art:\u00a0https://openclipart.org/detail/217463/jackass</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:38:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9c/f9c8c75c80580ed5d5e60ad80764f11c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fun To Build Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
