Retelling of the Unknowns Saga series in full details, as you see their entire life unfold. This copy is the uncensored version, the original story told that would have not otherwise be allowed in Google Play, Nintendo, PS and Xbox. This is not the full game and should not be expected as such, the U.I, extra content, music and sound effects are not implanted, making this demo just to keep programmers from stopping people on using A.I training tools (not copying) was time consuming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As such i used A.I stable diffusion\u00a0 to fight A.I art. when you see odd art in characters or background, it's 100% A.I art\u00a0 that copy the original art i have. Title screen is obvious to see, i will not use stable diffusion in the future, it's a protected layer to hide the real art.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T06:55:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9bd4cc79d4e9aeaf4ad2072f2155d22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["firecat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
