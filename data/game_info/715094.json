Make sure to use odd numbers unless you want the square to switch from red to green only.</p>\n<p>Btw when you resize the square after choosing a color it acts a bit crappy and that's cuz of the Sleep(number) I put to slow down the reticle when moving up and down, which actually worked but the problem is that\u00a0it also slows the resizing process.</p>\n<p>the controls are in the controls file.</p>\n<p>enjoy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:04:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/482/48281fa1ace1e48a923e9a500243b271.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HEY"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
