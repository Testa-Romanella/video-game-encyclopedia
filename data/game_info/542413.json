Any feedback you can give will go a long way toward making this game the best it can be!</p>\r\nIntroduction\r\n<p>Even Heroes Die is an\u00a0action platforming roguelite with elements from the Metroidvania and Zelda genres.\u00a0 \u00a0Your hero has been cursed with a mortal illness, and you must scour the ever-changing kingdom for a cure.</p>\n<p>Wait a second, roguelite Metroidvania?\u00a0\u00a0Sounds contradictory? It is- and it's pretty hard to get right. But as someone who loves both genres equally, I'm aiming to do them justice.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Even Heroes Die is one of the few roguelites I've seen that incorporate movement/ability-based progression that <strong>resets &amp; changes on every run</strong>.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some games, like Dead Cells, have this as part of the\u00a0<strong>meta progression,\u00a0</strong>meaning that the upgrades you find are persistent, finite, and spread across many runs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Even Heroes Die, with each run you'll lose all of your movement abilities and upgrades, and you'll discover a brand new set. In one run you might find a wall-climb ability,\u00a0and in the next you might find a jetpack.</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Procedurally generated levels that reset every time you die</li><li>Discover new powerups to explore hidden areas and find goodies!</li><li>Every six minutes, death will come for you- literally!\u00a0 One touch and you're as good as dead.\u00a0</li><li>Stave off death with the many \"vials\"\u00a0you'll find scattered across the kingdom.\u00a0 Sound sketchy?\u00a0 It is.\u00a0 Watch out for side effects!</li><li>Will you risk death or weaken yourself with side effects?\u00a0 Pick your poison.\u00a0</li><li>Supports keyboard and Xbox controllers, with remappable controls</li></ul>\r\nDemo scope:\r\n<p>This is the first demo I've released for the game, and as such, its scope\u00a0is very limited.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two areas to explore, laid out in a linear fashion.\u00a0 The final game will have three or four \"branches\"\u00a0that you can tackle in any order you wish,\u00a0 with each branch having an\u00a0\"overworld\"\u00a0and a \"dungeon\" area.</p>\n<p>Levels are created by stitching together predefined templates.\u00a0 Many more of these will need to be created\u00a0(especially unique ones for different areas), so you may notice some repetition in level layouts.</p>\n<p>The game contains 3 enemies and 6 different powers/upgrades to find.\u00a0 The final game will need many more.</p>\n<p>The game needs a bit more \"soul.\"\u00a0 Things like NPCs, sound effects, music, and more of those classic\u00a0\"tough roguelite choices\" all need to be added.</p>\n<p>This first, limited demo is mostly to test out the concept and get some feedback on the game's feel.\u00a0 What works, and what doesn't?\u00a0 Does the character feel <strong>good </strong>to control?\u00a0 Is the concept fundamentally flawed?</p>\n<p>Your feedback is much appreciated.\u00a0 You can leave\u00a0a comment here, file a bug report in the game, and if possible, please take the quick survey!\u00a0 I'd be happy to include you in the game's credits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T07:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/614/614df182e8c7ea13a3f8940f8dcc99ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KevynTheJar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
