I got a worse grade, cuz it wasn't \"proffesional enough\" lmao. When the line \"iiits cl cu :)\" line came, he looked at me like wtf is wrong with you. It was great. So a few months later, this german guy came in class to see if he wanted to be an exchange student. He asked us for a game we made. I grabbed my phone, and let him play a mobile version I made (this is PC btw). He left in silence. So yeah, this game is the best game ever made.</p>\n<p>This game is filled with copyright and NSFW shit. That's kinda the joke, I hope you'll like it.</p>\n<p>Plot (NSFW warning):</p>\n<p>Adolf and Willem were talking about chicken tits when they realized you make dolphin cheese, so they made a 1000000000 dollar rich company called double d (not to confuse with dubbel d). But the dolphin leader died and the new one declared a war against humanity. Can Adolf kill the new dolphin leader: \"Flippy\", if that's even his real name. I mean, with a plot with so many cliche's, you can probably already tell what he really is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T04:51:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bee/beea5a8f4d4f80667b39902282cba647.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FaceMeLikeAGod"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
