Your main objectives is to take control of all the point on a level. These points are represented by flags.</p>\n<p>The more time you spend on a level, the more difficult it will be to control your character.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the controls?<br/></strong>During the game you only do three things - move right, left and jump. The keys assigned to each of these actions are randomized before each level. Before the level begins, you are informed about which keys you will have to use to control your character.</p>\n<p>Every 70 seconds, once the countdown in the top right corner reaches zero, what each key does is randomized. For example a button which was previously used for jumping,\u00a0can now be used to move your character to the right.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the game relate to the game jam's theme?<br/></strong>It does so in two ways:</p>\n<ul><li>Due to randomized controls, the main character is difficult to control,</li><li>In order to beat a level, you must take control of multiple points (before that, they are <em>out of your control</em>)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:22:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f2/9f27de7513162baea03665170483263a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Indonesian Hackers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
