{"id": 852770, "slug": "eevol", "name": "EEvol", "name_original": "EEvol", "description": "<h3>EEvol - Electronic Evolution Simulator</h3>Create your own world, fill it with cells and watch them evolve. Edit DNA-s, monitor population count of species and give food to your favorite ones! <br/>EEvol is a super optimized, fast evolution simulator, simulating tens of thousands of cells at once. Game logic (circle physics, fluid simulation, cell behavior) runs entirely on the video card, making it blazing fast even on my low range AMD RX 550!<br/><br/><h3>World</h3>Generate one using the noise generator or build your own with the edit tools provided. Combine the two for maximal effect!<br/><ul><li>Fluid: There are no early life without the oceans, so naturally EEvol comes with a fluid simulator tightly coupled with other physics.<br/></li><li>Rock and stones: Found at the bottom of the ocean, rocks are stationary, stones are tumbled by fluid flow as sand does in the bottom of the oceans.<br/></li><li>Gas bubbles: Inspired by the purple deep sea vents at the bottom of the oceans, which some believe was the origin of the organic life as we know it!<br/></li><li>Dead cells: Their off white color is the same as marine snow, a shower of organic material falling from upper waters to the deep ocean.<br/></li><li>Living cells: Each cell has a DNA which controls how it grows and behaves! They have to eat (gas bubbles or dead cells) to collect energy because every action has an energy cost.<br/></li><li>Organelles: Generate random ones automatically or define by hand! Cells can set their hormone levels, grow flagellum, sense their environment, modify their size, stick to things and many more!<br/></li><li>DNAs: Use the basic built in ones, create your own by hand or let evolution do the heavy lifting for you!</li></ul><br/><h3>Cells</h3><ul><li>Cells are called blobs in this game. This is for legacy reasons, originally I released the game under the name 'Blob by bela'. This version is a rewritten version where game logic runs on the video card to be blazing fast!<br/></li><li>Species id: Each species has its own id. Blobs can only communicate with a blob with the same species id. Different species can have the same id, for example when a species is mutating, the resulting species will most likely have the same id.<br/></li><li>age: If a cell reaches the age of 10000 simulation steps it will die.<br/></li><li>E: Each blob needs energy to do anything. Can be regenerated by eating. When a blob is created with the egg DNA command it has 1000 E.<br/></li><li>hp: Hitpoints. Can decrease by tumbling forcefully with rocks or one cell can attack the other. When a blob is created with the egg DNA command it has 10 hp.<br/></li><li>pc: Program counter, which DNA instruction the blob will do next.<br/></li><li>pc timer: Cooldown between executing DNA instructions.<br/></li><li>Hormones: Each cell has 8 different hormone levels. Both DNA execution and behavior can be affected by these.<br/></li><li>Hormone pumps: Unused, will be removed.<br/></li><li>If table: Each cell have 8 slots to store conditionals to. DNA opcode 'jump to' is affected by these.<br/></li><li>Prio table<ul> <li>Each cell have 8 slots to store input modifiers to. This affects the behavior of the cell.<br/> </li><li>Each prio table slot identifies an organelle. If that organelle is an input organelle that has input data (for example a sense organelle sensed something) the prio table slot is considered valid.<br/> </li><li>Each output organelle has a starting and ending prio table location ranging from 1 to 8. When it calculates an output it checks if the prio table entry at the starting prio location is valid. If not, it checks at starting prio location + 1. If not checks at starting location + 2. This continues up to the ending prio location.<br/> </li><li>If no valid prio table slot found no output is performed.<br/> </li><li>If a valid prio table slot is found the search stops. The input data is multiplied or added to a constant value and optionally a hormone value. The resulting value is the output value of the organelle. Each organelle type does a different thing with this value.<br/> </li></ul></li><li>Organelles: Each cell has 8 organelle slots. These can be passive (e.g size), input (e.g sensing) or output (e.g flagellum) organelles.<br/></li><li>What happens during one sim step<ul> <li>Collision resolution: The blob reacts to things it collided with. It tries to connect to things if it has the appropriate connection organelle and it pokes each collided blob with different species id than its own.<br/> </li><li>DNA execution: If the pc timer is 1 the pc-th instruction is executed. Most instructions take 50 simulation steps to execute. Growing a new organelle, fission and egg takes more.<br/> </li><li>Input organelle step: Each input organelle where the cooldown is 0 tries to get input data.<br/> </li><li>Output organelle step: Each output organelle where the cooldown is 0 parses the prio table and tries to get an output.<br/> </li></ul></li></ul><br/><h3>DNA</h3><ul><li>nothing: Does nothing<br/></li><li>organelle: slot, add/del, which organelle<br/></li><li>prio table: slot, input organelle slot, +/*, hormone slot, constant, is hormone in the calculation or not<br/></li><li>hormone: pump or level, slot, set or modify, constant<br/></li><li>if table: slot, value of what, comparisson, value of what/constant<br/></li><li>fission: mode, direction, delta h<ul> <li>The cell divides into two, halfing the E and hp between the two cells.
