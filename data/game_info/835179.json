The idea was to make a battle tatics game\u00a0similiar to Fire Emblem and Advance Wars, but your troops could engage in long combats for many turns until one of the units is defeated. The strategy is to flank the enemy units with infantary and cavalary and using the terrain as an advantage.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy,\u00a0 it was my first time making that type of game. I plan to make improvements\u00a0^^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T05:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06e23ca2cef8059b652cc82ffd04708d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hokabe"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
