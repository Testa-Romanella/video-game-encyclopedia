{"id": 101640, "slug": "grave-days", "name": "Grave Days (itch)", "name_original": "Grave Days (itch)", "description": "<p>Grave Days is a game about surviving the Zombie Apocalypse. It focuses more on\u00a0action-packed fun rather than\u00a0strategic-realism in terms of gameplay, though is still a survival game rather than a shooter. The game tells an evolving story of a survivor, Grave Dave, and his struggles in a world where society has collapsed under the weight of a Zombie Apocalypse.</p>\r\nStealth &amp; Scavenge\r\n<p>In this post apocalyptic world you will find yourself in short supply of just about everything - food, ammo, medicine and friends. Rather than shooting and making a racket, you need to stealthily\u00a0scavenge the procedurally generated cities and towns for loot - vital to your survival - and you need to conserve your bullets for that moment\u00a0when you really need it!</p>\r\n\r\nZombies, Disease and Distrust\r\n<p>Zombies themselves are fairly weak - but their threat is persistent and daunting. You can easily take them out with a well aimed bullet, but doing so might just serve to attract a horde - and you need to be certain you are prepared.</p>\n<p>Worse than the individual zombies themselves are the disease they carry - which can spread to survivors through bites and scratches. This disease triggers bad fevers, and makes survival in an already unforgiving environment even harder. Though there is hope: suppressants can keep the disease at bay, and cures could eradicate the disease from your system entirely - if only you could find it!</p>\n\n<p>Worse still, is the threat they present to society. Since the outbreak, society has completely collapsed and there is a great amount of distrust amongst individuals as everyone fights for their own survival. You will have to deal with distrusting survivors in a world where team work is almost essential - while looking for ways to exploit others to better your own chances without making too many enemies. You will be faced with moral dilemmas where you may be forced to use your last bullet on an acquaintance, or perhaps even a friend, to ensure your escape.</p>\r\nEvolving Roguelite Story\r\n<p>The player will unravel Dave's story - which may include becoming a fearless and respected leader of a gang of survivors - or it may be the story of a lone wolf mercenary\u00a0and trader in a world where ammo is the currency. This story will be different every time. The game is hard and unforgiving - but shines a light of hope in the form of progression. Every play-through allows you to unlock new classes of loot\u00a0and new survivors -\u00a0and alter the world in ways that are meaningful to your progression. Perhaps one day you can lead Dave to finding and eradicating the source of the disease - but only time will tell!\u00a0</p>\n\r\nEarly Access\r\n<p>Please note that this is a very early alpha development build.
