Each level is designed to be played in one sitting, with each attempt granting you access to different and more powerful build options for future attempts. <br/>The action takes place in the middle worlds, the corporeal planes between the ether and the void who are in an eternal dance of conflict and power.<br/>Each middle world has multiple bosses and unique challenges to overcome, requiring you to adapt and specialise your builds to be successful. <br/><br/><h3>Take on the middle worlds with pseudo Roguelike gameplay.</h3><br/>Each time you take a new host, you will be weak and without a means to defend yourself, you must gather resources and find equipment, helping those aligned with you and killing those who are not. As you progress helper spirits will offer you their blessing to help you take on the void spirits who are infiltrating that world, leading to epic boss battles that will take skill, timing and preparation to overcome. However, should you die and cant find a suitable host in time you will lose all progress in that world and be forced to return to the ether.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Craft powerful and unique builds.</h3>As you progress through the worlds your host will level up and get stronger, although how they get stronger is up to you. As your host levels up you will be offered a small selection of blessings from the whisps that you have unlocked, getting more powerful with each level. You can also obtain lower level blessings from whisps that you find hiding in objects in the middle worlds, and if you dont already have have them you will unlock new blessings for future attempts. There are many different types of whisps available, granting blessings such as the ability to strike two times for every hit, reflect a small amount of damage to all nearby enemies, or even to stack poison damage on each hit.<br/><br/><h3>Play with friends!</h3>Ethereal Rift is playable by yourself, or with up to 3 other friends, and they can drop in and out in the same save game whenever you return to the ether. Stuck on a tough boss? get some friends around and take them down as a team!<h3>Explore new worlds.</h3>Take your time and explore the procedurally generated worlds, each one extremely unique and beautiful, and teeming with hidden secrets for those willing to look.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-12T02:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ec31086a49be6b46dbe669d637bf2c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack Vanderkolk"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jack Vanderkolk"], "esrb_rating": null}
