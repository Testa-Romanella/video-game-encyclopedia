The game has simple shooting mechanics, bullet hell dodging and various enemies. Without getting too much into the story for spoiler reasons, the game has an emphasis on being yourself, and not letting others get in the way of that.</p>\n\n<p>This was my first ever Game Jam, and while I wish I could have done more, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish in such a short time. If you play the game, I hope you at least get a little bit of fun from it, although I know many things are rushed.</p>\n\n<p>I will be uploading a YouTube video of me making the game on my channel \u00a0within the next couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>https://youtube.com/itsjackson</p>\n<p>music by: kittyteam</p><p>~ itsjackson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T06:01:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25e/25e031713ef646d850a8f14b8bb53bc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itsjackson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
