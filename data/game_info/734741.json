In Land of Screens, guide Holland on her new mission to ditch the social media saturation and discover some real-world relationships by enlisting the help of a few new friends, some synthy chiptune jams, and the inimitable chemistry of small children and adorable animals.<h3>A Point-And-Click Adventure of Internet Escapism</h3>Put on your fanciest mingling cap to conquer harrowingly familiar challenges such as:<br/><br/><ul><li>Navigating an impromptu party where your only choices of company are strangers\u2014or worse: friends you haven\u2019t seen since high school.<br/></li><li>Meandering through a hotel lobby to force awkward introductions with fellow attendees of a professional conference.<br/></li><li>Making the best of last-minute concert plans where you\u2019ve never heard of the band, been to the venue, or met any of the people you\u2019re there with.<br/></li><li>Family. Reunions.<br/></li><li>Getting your friends excited about doing nature stuff so they can convince other people to start doing nature stuff so you can all spend the day doing nature stuff.</li></ul><h3>Just Get Everyone to Stop Looking at their Phones\u2026 No Problem.</h3>No matter where Holland goes to try and get away, everyone is glued to their screens. She\u2019ll need the help of old friends and new acquaintances\u2014and they\u2019ll need help from her\u2014to dodge the online madness and finally unplug for a while. By diving (or stumbling) into fresh experiences, new relationships, and accidental adventures, Holland might just stand a fighting chance of escaping the ever-present creep of social media drama.<h3>Remember How Nice it is to Talk at People\u2019s Actual Faces?</h3>In a world stuck on digital connections, the only way Holland is going to get through this breakup with her sanity intact is to go analog. Fortunately, she\u2019ll soon learn just how many enticing adventures are out there, away from the continuous social media commentary. Sure, she could obsess over an online thread of opinions about her breakup like everyone normally would, but maybe there\u2019s another way\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-17T00:09:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/4304f758f264cfe417ca98e09f6c9ed2.jpg", "website": "https://landofscreens.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2, "toplay": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Serenity Forge"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Way Down Deep"], "esrb_rating": null}
