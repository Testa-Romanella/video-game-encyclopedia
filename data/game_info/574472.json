The project displays how to work with player controllers and different input from the keyboard or other devices, working 2D gravity, interaction between NPC and the player, and the use of C# scripts.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Modifications Made:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>A complete and thorough level3 that is visually different from basic level1 and level2.\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0A complete and through level4 that is visually different from basic level1 and level2 and different from the more complex level3.</li><li>Different game audio on each level to make each level feel more unique.\u00a0</li><li>Different enemy esthetics, along with different enemies on each round.\u00a0</li><li>Edited the PlayerController script to modify the player jump. The new jump is quite a bit larger, with more float time, allowing the player to jump from obstacle to obstacle and making it harder to control in tight areas. This was done by editing some of the variables values at the top of the code, with additional modification to the player velocity and force when they jump. It was more about messing around with different values than completely rewriting the script, too little and the jump wouldn't move the player off the ground, too much and the player had no control or sometimes would break the game and jump through walls.\u00a0</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T09:20:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bd/3bd7ccd7c295d2e81a1835519a81a31f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gyulves1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
