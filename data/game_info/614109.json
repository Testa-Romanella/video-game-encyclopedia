Namely:</p>\n<ul><li>Pause Menu</li><li>Actual Controller Suppoort</li><li>Working Contact Tab</li><li>Working Email List Tab</li><li>Sfx + Music</li><li>Sending Recording of full gameplay</li><li>Update Notification</li><li>Numerous known bugs</li><li>Animations and polish (especially with the gun)</li><li>Heavy Performance fixes</li><li>Light Buddy!</li></ul>\n<p>However for now, the game is at least <em>playable </em>with mouse/keyboard. Playing this version yourselves would be appreciated , and any feedback in the comments would be appreciated. Stay tuned for a complete version!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T05:48:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/855/85511605c787f9423733da5c41166e43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Etra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
