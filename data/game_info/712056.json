(itch) (iamlost04)", "description": "<p>This is my Completed 3D shooter, Invasion! After a rough landing, you\u00a0\u00a0wake up in an unusual place, the foggy, muggy and dark. You remember you were supposed to be exploring a new celestial body. This must be the place! There is a screeching noise, and suddenly you see them, all of them! Giant killer bugs! They're everywhere, coming straight for you! Aim, shoot, and fight your way through to\u00a0escape this dangerous world! In our homes, bugs are invaders, but in their world, it is us who trespass on their land. Happy playing!</p>\n<p>Modifications:</p>\n<p>1. Color scheme - I made my own texture to give the game a moody/mysterious, outside of the known world appeal, using greens, blacks, and pinks</p>\n<p>2. I modified the colors of all the buildings and structures to flow better with my environment, creating a bit of aesthetic unity.</p>\n<p>3. Made a hazy green skybox to create an ominous vibe.</p>\n<p>4. Game flow design. I designed my level 1 into four different\u00a0stages. intro area-fairly easy(1), through the lab(with mini enclosed spawner areas)(2), open world key find(3), and chaotic portal jump(4)(large numbers of enemies attacking you as you complete the level)- I put checkpoints at the crossroads of each level to make it convient for the player.</p>\n<p>Assets created by: MSU Labs</p>\n<p>Produced by: Zoe Rasico</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T08:03:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14d26e2e3a198ed5ce099d9291ec5e3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["iamlost04"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
