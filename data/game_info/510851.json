You naughty girl you~</p>\n\n<p>This is a simple maze game based off an older twitter meme. I know that other clones exist, but hey, I'm bored and have some vague sense of how to use unity.</p>\n\n<p>This is something I made in 90 minutes out of boredom. I'm not sure I'll ever update the game, but feel free to suggest updates or changes to me!</p><p>UPDATE: Well, Ben heard that you've enjoyed his maze and decided to make a special appearance for you. Don't let Uncle Ben get you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T05:30:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38e/38e16d0b19bee634afd6fb9ef0f81905.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Port'sNotAlt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
