It will only take you about 15 minutes to complete it. Well, maybe 30 minutes if you are a real achievement hunter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every action (and inaction) has its consequences. Every decision can lead to catastrophic results. Like whether you decide to dig up a skeleton in a peaceful forest clearing or let it rest. Or cross a rickety bridge over a deep ravine. Or\u2026 well, you\u2019ll discover the rest yourself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game has five endings. Sad, epic, controversial\u2026 Some are happier than others. Will you dare to unlock all of them?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like any self-respecting fairy tale, this story has a charismatic narrator, an adventurous hero, and a couple of mysterious strangers. All of them have voices - literally and metaphorically. <br/><br/><br/><br/>This game is crafted in full 2D. Like back in the day, when the grass was greener and the third dimension was a subject of legends and myths. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Just come on in and play. There is no microtransactions, NFTs, paywalls, or other greedy creatures.<br/><br/>Enjoy the journey!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T06:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a40d874d02815e700534fe5fd0507192.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pickled Sword Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pickled Sword Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
