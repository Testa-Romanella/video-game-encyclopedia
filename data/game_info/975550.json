At the beginning of the game, the main character marries his friend so that she can stay in the country (Both characters can be renamed). He had feelings for her when they were younger, but never managed to act on them. Now that she's married to him... who knows? He may be able to turn this sham marriage into a real one! He will also meet many other characters on this journey; some will help him develop his relationship with his new wife, and others will seek to break them apart!<h3>CHARACTER BUILDING</h3><br/>The main character will be able to influence other characters he meets, based on his own characteristics. As his own skills grow, so does his ability to change other people. One of the basic ways of influencing his new wife is to increase their Love Points. The higher the points, the more likely she will be accept the main character's requests.<h3>AFFILIATION SYSTEM</h3><br/>When the main character starts working, he'll be able to choose which political affiliation his company has. PDC will give him a stat boost, which will help with increasing Love Points with other characters, as well as influencing others. Choosing USF will grant the \"Snoop\" ability. He will be able to spy on others physically or with technology. Both options are valid for any style of playthrough, but if you want the full NTR (jealousy inducing) experience, USF is likely the better option.<h3>TRAITS SYSTEM</h3><br/>As the game progresses, the player will be able to pick up personality traits for the player's wife. She will act differently depending on her accumulated traits!<h3>HOTWIFE? CHEATING?</h3><br/>Wifey's Dilemma Revisited features an expansive hotwifing and/or cheating content as well. This needs to be turned on at the beginning of the game. If you do not enjoy these kinks, they can be disabled permanently. If turned on, the main antagonists will compete against the player for his love interest. There are ways to turn those antagonists into friends... or you can watch as they take the player's love interest away!<h3>PERSONALIZED INTIMACY</h3><br/>Depending on the player's stats and choices, intimacy scenes will play out differently, and will have different dialogue!<h3>IMPACT OF CHOICES</h3><br/>Based on the player's choices, the characters will evolve, emotionally and physically in drastically different ways!
