The sequence goes from the 2 to the King (K). You can put the Ace (A) before the 2 or after the King. During the game you can add more cards to the meld. <br/><br/>Buying the discard pile: To buy the discard pile, just click on the cards that are on the discard. <br/><br/>Stockpile: A deck of 11 cards that a player receives when the cards of his hand are over. If the game is with 4 players, each stockpile corresponds to a double. Only the first player of the double, who ends with his cards, can pick up the stockpile. It\u2019s not possible that the same double, or even the same player,  to pick up two stockpiles. If the bunch\u2019s cards  reaches the end , and if there is any stockpile at the table, this one will be automatically used as bunch. <br/><br/>Going out: To go out means when the cards of a player ends, if this player or team has already picked up the stockpile. If the stockpile hasn\u2019t been picked by any player, the only way to go out is when both stockpiles become bunch and the cards in the player\u2019s hand has ended. <br/><br/>Going out directly: It\u2019s when the player ends up with his cards without discarding any, in other words, all the cards goes to his melds. If there\u2019s any stockpile, the player will pick it up and will continue to play without buying any card. <br/><br/>Going out indirectly: Occurs when the players ends the cards in his hands discarding any other. If there\u2019s a stockpile, the player will pick it up, playing only at the next round, when it\u2019ll be his turn again.<br/><br/>Canasta: Meld of seven cards or more of the same value or in sequence, of the same suit. There are four types of Canastas.<br/><br/>To know the Project better enter: <br/>- www.burracoon.com<br/>- facebook.com/burracoon", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:23:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/3448283a9bbf4ff2f09a0598cfca9ded.jpg", "website": "http://onrizon.com.br", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Gartic"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Henrique Almeida"], "esrb_rating": null}
