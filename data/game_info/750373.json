{"id": 750373, "slug": "resurgence-2014", "name": "Resurgence (2014)", "name_original": "Resurgence (2014)", "description": "<p>Resurgence is a 32 maps megawad project, an upgrade from the unfinished Surge project. The maps are similar to Speed of Doom, ranging from Scythe/Plutonia-like maps to Speed of Doom to Resurgence-unique. The difficulty is considerably less in places but there are several challenging maps to plow through with the occasional slaughtermaps. (For those who don&#39;t like slaughter, avoid Map11,25,27,28,30) Sizes vary greatly (for the sake of variety), ranging from quick paced maps lasting 5 minutes to a long grind that could last even an hour. The project took about a year to complete. Surge was originally a month, and Resurgence took 7 months of non-stop work, 5 months hiatus and then a month of intensive sessions. The Surge maps that has not been heavily modified are Map05,13,14. Although not everyone will like all maps, hopefully this megawad offers several things that can be appreciated and also offers fun and challenges (I am looking at you demo-recording speed- runners...).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T13:01:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f2/0f298d09db0fd6a65d7eeadb8f30e11e.jpg", "website": "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/resurge", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
