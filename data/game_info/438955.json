The aspects the user can change are the shape of the 3D object and the amount of color in the object. There are toggles allowing the user to randomize size and color. Select object shape from the Dropdown Menu. Move RGB sliders to change colors. Users can clear the screen and toggle on/off the destroy timer. Users can press \u201cD\u201d to enable/disable animations and press \u201cA\u201d to switch between animations.
