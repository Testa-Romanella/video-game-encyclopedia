Sadly, I can't draw a thing to save my life xD But I enjoy making games a lot, so I wanted to make a little game based on a fanart by @_nanasheep I saw last year\u00a0under the \"Trust\" prompt that showed two enemy players getting along by the sacred art of teabagging xD So I thougt on making a game based on that idea of teabagging to befriend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the link to the art that inspired me</p>\n<p>Last year I didn't finish it, but this year I really wanted to make something so I decided to mix a prompt of this year with the game idea and came up with this.</p>\n\n<p>Originally this was going to be under the prompt\u00a0 \"Journey\" cuase I was planning on adding every legend and multiple levels, but as time went by I realized that I needed to make something smaller so I could be able to finish it before the month ended, so I decided to use Mirage and Path since Path loves Mirage &lt;3.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I know is very lacking on environmental art, level and game design; I struggle to come up with mechanics or ideas, but I enjoy programming and making mechanics and tools and enjoyed to make this thing a lot, I hope that you like it &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T07:54:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/258/258fd0a79c0d6b9ba6fe627a40717b35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rafa_la_Garrafa"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
