Also, improved controls, in-game bug reporting system, and general improvements!\u00a0<strong>NOW ON KICKSTARTER!\u00a0</strong>Check it out for exclusive backer rewards and an early bird discount :D</p>\n<p><strong>\u2014Important Notes &amp; Install Instructions\u2014</strong></p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Make sure the game files are FULLY DOWNLOADED before launching. Seems like common sense, but you\u2019d be surprised XD</p>\n<p><strong>FIRST TIME LAUNCH</strong>: The first time you launch the game, it may take a few moments longer than usual. You may see only a black screen while the game finishes initial setup, so don\u2019t panic. It should boot much faster after the first time.</p>\n<p><strong>SETTINGS</strong>: Go to the Settings screen on the Main Menu after starting the game to adjust Resolution and other settings for optimal performance on your computer. If the game is laggy, reducing resolution and toggling v-sync can help tremendously. All Settings will be saved automatically after that.</p>\n<p><strong>BUG REPORTING</strong>: There is now a built in Profiler and Bug Reporting system. Just press the \u201cB\u201d key on your keyboard if you wish to submit a bug report. It will automatically take a screenshot (of only the game, not your whole screen) at the exact moment you press the button. It will attach anonymous system info and error reports. If you leave some notes about the bug it would be very helpful. You may leave your email as well, if you want me to get back to you about it. Thanks for your help in bug squashing!</p>\n<p><strong>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:</strong>\u00a0It\u2019s still too early in development to commit to specific minimum requirements. However, as long as you have a decent 3D graphics card, capable of playing modern 3D games with similar graphics, you should be able to run it fine. CPU and Memory requirements are quite low. It\u2019s still in early Alpha phase, so I\u2019ve done very little optimization work on it yet.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS - Windows</strong></p>\n<p>-Decompress the file using any un-zip application.</p>\n<p>-Double-click the .exe file.</p>\n<p>-Make sure these files are in a NEW folder.If you try to run the game directly from the ZIP folder it will not work.</p>\n<p>-If you have very strict security software, you may need to adjust settings to allow the game to play, since it was not downloaded from a known source, such as Steam or an app store.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Have fun and if you like it, please check out my Kickstarter so I can make Guts and Glory bigger, better, and faster!</p>\n<p>Have a most excellent day!</p>\n<p><em>- HakJak</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:57:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/050/05039277b7b8e8143df7de5646db2215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hakjakgames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
