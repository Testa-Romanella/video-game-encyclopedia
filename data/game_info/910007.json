Hence the emergence of surrogate robots, whose task is to act as \"brains\" to access the human body and maintain its normal functioning. However, due to the huge differences between machines and humans, each surrogate robot needs to undergo extensive simulation training before going to work.</p>\n<p>You are now a surrogate robot in training and you need to pay attention to the physical and mental state of humans and organise daily activities for them. And because of the epidemic, doctors will be constantly tracking your path, and getting too close to them will greatly reduce human mental strength, so please be careful to keep your distance. But constant movement will in turn lead to a decrease in human stamina. You can choose activities such as eating or reading a book to increase your character's mental and physical strength.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T07:26:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/151/1515bd59facfa190aceaf26e2261dc3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ershiqi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
