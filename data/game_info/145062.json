It is simple and intiutive to play. You have to shoot \r\nand destroy each block while avoiding being shot at. If you're shot 3 \r\ntimes or more, then it's game over. The idea is to get the highest score\r\n possible by surviving as long as possible, with increasing difficulty.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce676edda2fd0b71bc357843ce623f86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sam Hellawell"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
