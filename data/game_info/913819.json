May it be because he\u2018s lazy, always sleeping, unable to fly or due to his different appearance. This feeling solidifies when he wakes up one morning finding himself at the root of his home - the tree he\u2018s spent all his life in. After making up his mind, he decides\u00a0 to accept the challenge and climb back up to his family\u2018s nest and confront them. The only question left is; how will he be able to get back up, without the ability to fly and being oblivious to the dangers ahead of him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Music and Sounds from\u00a0Epidemic Sounds,\u00a0We Love Indies\u00a0and edited with\u00a0Reaper</li><li>Made with\u00a0Unity and\u00a0Aseprite</li><li>Teachers and related people of the\u00a0HTK Academy</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T09:01:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7da2f5c8f02df3cd27555f4fb39fe405.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MonkeeDan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
