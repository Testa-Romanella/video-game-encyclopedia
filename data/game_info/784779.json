In this game I was practicing different concepts and on the basics A/D will steer the rocket left and right. Spacebar will activate thrusters. In this game you will see basic particle systems that are being called through scripts and sound systems. I experimented with lighting and different level designs(they aren't the best and that's okay I'm just practicing).\u00a0Please feel free to give me feedback. When you want to exit the game just press ESC no need to alt+f4!!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T13:36:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef0fd04dd940d366f12d271b2b51a468.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kota_harrison"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
