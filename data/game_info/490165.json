ARC is a role-playing game for players who want to save the world, surmount impossible odds, and emerge as heroes that defeat the apocalypse before precious time runs out. Inspired by OSR, ARC is light on rules but heavy on the tension. Can you make it out alive before the end?<br/></p>\n\n<p>As a real-time Doomsday Clock slowly ticks to its end, heroes must fight their way to salvation through Skill Checks, physical or psychosocial conflict, as well as strange Spells and Techniques. Highlights include:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Manage your hours. Dictate how much time you'll spend per session. Tackle dreadful Omens while you grapple with what little time you have left.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\r\nCelebrate player ingenuity. Don't just use \r\nSkills --- articulate your specific problem-solving Approach: whether \r\ncreatively, carefully, or in a concerted manner.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\r\nStrategic player-driven combat. Conflict \r\ninitiative is based on what you do, not through a roll. Strategize with \r\nyour allies on how to time and sequence your actions.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\r\nA new approach to Spellcasting. Spells and \r\nTechniques sit in your inventory, and impose odd rituals to refresh \r\nthem. One in particular asks your hero to eat a door!</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Read the overview of the game and learn how to craft your story's Doom --- the central plot of your story.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for the mailing list for notification on when the full game releases.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:56:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf1/cf1523589ef9d4b6081b4da32bcf1914.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["momatoes"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
