The Dims (Dimensioners)\u00a0are gaining the upper hand. Their mastery of magic means they can bring some of their weapons through the dimensional gates. Our home world defenses will begin to fall soon, yet our offense is impossibly weak.</p>\n<p>However, it seems that the Dims are unaware that the dimensional gates can also send us through time. This gives us a glimmer of hope. Can we send our brightest and best into key points of the Dims history and rid them of their successful leaders before they launch their attacks?</p>\n<p>Each jump through time and dimensional space is an opportunity to change history and, maybe, stop the war from ever starting. Countless lives can be saved, but how many times will you lose yours?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T06:01:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92f/92fbdab735d673c6ec61e584b639be99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WizardsCode"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
