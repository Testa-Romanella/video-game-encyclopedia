It is designed to gamify content in an attempt to make rote memorization required to learn Japanese less painful. Right now, the game contains:</strong><br/><ul><li>Hiragana characters as well Y\u014d-on (the combination of characters).<br/></li><li>Katakana characters as well Y\u014d-on (the combination of characters).<br/></li><li>Database to track your progress. If you are having trouble with characters, the game will learn this and provide it more often later until you have learned the character. The database uses 9 tracking points for each Phonetic sound to best feed you what you need to learn for Hiragana and Katakana.<br/></li><li>A learn mode the shows you a character to learn, it's Romanji and Katakana/Hiragana counterpart.<br/></li><li>The learn mode also plays the sound made by the character and click on the character will repeat the sound.<br/></li><li>A test mode that tests you on the learn mode content provided. Answering correctly will give you overall points to show your development. As well as multiple answers in a row will create combo points.<br/></li><li>The game will take you through the characters of both alphabets once. During this time, you will learn new letters and be presented characters you have seen in learn mode. Answering correctly will help unlock an advanced mode for Hiragana Katakana that will use the matching character from the other alphabet for testing. <br/></li><li>After you have been through both alphabets once the database is used to feed you characters you have trouble with. Answering correctly will lower the learning priority of the character.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e9/5e99d6052c8deb119073248ebc03e06b.jpg", "website": "http://nihongotoki.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tyler Hamilton"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tyler Hamilton"], "esrb_rating": null}
