Heck, I don't blame him 'cause there ain't no place like Hickston. But according to my map, we're gonna have to blast our way through jack o' lope farms and a riverboat as well as a brothel (Bubba can't wait) 'fore we get home again.\n<br/><br/>\nToosday: Met new folks like Daisy Mae (she's purty). Bikers, pigs, cows and jack o' lopes. I think I even saw the King at the Slurp n' Burp.\n<br/><br/>\nWinsday: Yeehaw! Got to joyride in a Swamp Buggy and a motorcycle that were both armed to the teeth. I hope those peoples I ran over will be alrite. I still got a darn jack 'o lope stuck in the grill though.\n<br/><br/>\nThersday: New ways to destroy stuff! I found over 10 weapons like a crossbow that shoots dynamite-loaded chickens and a slingblade. Mmmm-Hmm!\n<br/>\nFri-day: Sure am hungry! I just need some good ol' redneck powerups like pork rinds, cow pies and some of my granpappy's moonshine!\n<br/>\nSaterday: Boy I sure so like those toe tapping tunes by that good ol' boy Mojo Nixon.\n<br/>\nSunday: Heck! With all the new places we been, I sure wish my kinfolk could've come along for the ride!\n<br/><br/>\nWant to experience more than just a week? Then take a dip into the Redneck's world of floating whiskey and widespread pork rinds. The crazy adventure continues through Redneck Rampage, Redneck Rampage Rides Again: Arkansas and Redneck Rampage: Suckin' Grits on Route 66. Now all three games bundled together.\n<br/><br/>\nBut wait, there's more!
