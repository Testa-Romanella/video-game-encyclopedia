{"id": 961010, "slug": "the-red", "name": "The Red", "name_original": "The Red", "description": "In this satirical first-person-shooter + tower-defense game you will be exploited by a soulless megacorporation as an involuntarily indentured security associate on Mars.  You will work for trillionaires, collecting dirt.  No, \"dirt\" is not a euphemism for \"compromising information\", nothing cool like that.  Literally just dirt.  Like, from the ground.  Fancy dirt worth more than your entire life, sure, but still, just dirt.  Nevertheless, the job pays well, so no complaining.  You will receive a cut of all you manage to collect.  Upon your return, a tiny fraction of the value of the dirt will be converted into your commission, and it will be worth more than your entire home town.  If, by some insane miracle you survive the few days it will take to pay back your debt to the company, and assuming you don't spend it all at the company store, you'll return to Earth with wealth beyond your wildest dreams.  So, let's see that team-player smile!  A few days of hard work on Mars, and, one way or the other, you'll never work again.<br/><br/>This game is a solo developer's mild critique of life under late stage capitalism and a parody of the sci-fi gaming genre while still being a fun and unique experience.  Players can expect to:<br/><br/><ul><li>Build and place a variety of turrets, light-walls, proximity mines, and energy shields at strategic locations to protect both main base and resource extraction points from waves of enemies.<br/></li><li>Use a variety of first-person weapons to help shore up defenses and personally protect high-value assets.<br/></li><li>Repair damaged extractors.<br/></li><li>Use resources to build new extractors and use specialized equipment to determine optimal locations to place them based on resource density in the surrounding areas.<br/></li><li>Earn enough money to pay for a trip back home to Earth.<br/></li><li>Be in constant threat of danger at all times, from both the local wildlife who will rip out a player's lungs before they can scream, and from their employer who took out a hefty life insurance policy on them.</li></ul><br/>The game is easy to get good at, and hard to win.  It begins at a leisurely pace but eventually evolves into complete mayhem.  There are secrets to discover, but they all lead nowhere.  Dying often is expected, even on the easiest difficulty, and the hardest difficulty is intentionally unfair.  If you do survive, however, you will have earned more than you could have ever hoped to see in your entire lifetime.  So, what are you waiting for?
