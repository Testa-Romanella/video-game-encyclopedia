Neighbors are said to have heard screams and violence. However, there are no houses nearby. Just a huge and seemingly abandoned old mansion. Still, something is going on inside, so he goes in, alone with no means of external communication and unexplainable and psycho-traumatic events. Here he finds out a lot about a Cooper Morris who is apparently behind everything and seems mentally ill in some ways.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nico Neukirchen and Cedric Peltzer are two young game developers from Germany.
