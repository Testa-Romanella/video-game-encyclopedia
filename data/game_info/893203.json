{"id": 893203, "slug": "3d-bitcoin-visualizer-prototype-v1", "name": "3d Bitcoin Visualizer Prototype V1", "name_original": "3d Bitcoin Visualizer Prototype V1", "description": "<p>For controls:\u00a0Open menu / hit Escape\u00a0</p>\n<p>Prototype build of a 3d blockchain visualizer. It generates a randomized blockchain. It has a stack of cubes that represent the chain of blocks. Each cube has 3 green circles near it that represent the transactions in that block. Each circle is connected to input symbols\u00a0and output symbols. The inputs and outputs are sometimes connected if an address has a transaction in two consecutive blocks.</p>\n<p>Upcoming features:</p>\n<ul><li>Pull in bitcoin data from an API and generate the actual bitcoin blockchain. From a optimization standpoint, this is going to be a challenge with so many txs and addresses. But maybe it will be possible with ECS / DOTS.\u00a0</li><li>Better UI that can highlight transaction history and somehow make it user friendly to view. TX and address searching. Input/output organizing.</li><li>Maybe replace billboard sprites with 3d models because it looks better.</li><li>Represent \"coinbase\"\u00a0transactions in each block.\u00a0</li><li>Display transaction amounts somehow.</li><li>Display UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs). Maybe show them as output symbols\u00a0at the top block and connect them with a vertical line that goes to the transaction they came from below.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>You can generate multiple blockchains on top of eachother.\u00a0 And the lines freak out if you do.</li><li>It will generate unconnected inputs and outputs</li></ul>\n<p>@henhound on Twitter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T05:51:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da8/da8b00bf21032d2bddc05d450b1a0544.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Henhound"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
