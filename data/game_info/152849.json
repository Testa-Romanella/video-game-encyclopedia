In Polyblast, shoot to blast moving targets and eliminate the descending geometrical shapes before they reach the bottom of your screen! Sounds simple but before you know it, you will find yourself racing to catch up! Polyblast requires speed, precision and some calculated planning to complete the level! You will find plenty of power-ups to help you along the way - so blast to activate them and if used right they will help you finish the level better and faster.</p><p>There are a total of 4 packs each containing 3 themed worlds and 45 levels. The starring system has been added to track your performance and progress. You will need to accumulate a set number of stars to move on to the next pack. If you don't have the required number of stars, you can always go back to earlier levels and give it another go! If that's not enough, you also have a set of 4 themed worlds that have been added along the way under the \"Season's\" section</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a67b0cefb7dce6bf31b676e6fdf1452.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Game Cooks"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
