It is up to you, your archery skills, and your ability to instantly craft rockets and explosives out of dust to protect the Palace at all costs.<br/><br/><strong>THINGS TO DO<br/></strong><br/>Make sure to shoot enemies in the head to kill them. Shooting horsemen in the head will only knock them off their horse, so make sure to shoot them again once they're on the ground. Killing enemies awards points and leaves dust on the ground.
