Hovering over a UI slot and letting go will place the creature in that slot.\u00a0</p><p>Edit: Upon traveling back to the main scene the creatures you placed in your bag will automatically join your ever expanding group. To combine creatures simply click on the combine menu button, mouse over a creature in the scene, and click and drag the creature into a slot within the combine menu. Every new creature you bring back with you to the main scene, or discover through combination\u00a0will automatically update the Dex menu with a new entry letting you know which creatures you have and have not seen.</p>\n<p>Note: although not fully implemented, you can release creatures back into the wild from the main scene for a small amount of exp. The exp was supposed to act as a currency, however, I did not have enough time to implement enough shop items to justify including it into the demo.</p>\n\r\nCredit\r\n<p>All code is written by myself, besides the use of some Tween Library code from LeanTween (Asset Store). Some UI and background assets were drawn by me. All \"creatures\" drawn by me.<br/><br/>\r\nThird Party Assets:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I'm terribly sorry In my rush to upload the project before crashing in bed the night before the deadline I neglected to credit the background music you may hear in game. The bellow link is my source for the music track used in game.</p>\n<p>https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle</p>\n<p>\r\n\"Simple Dessert - Free Tileset\" by WRLCK on gamedevmarket.net<br/>\r\n\"Patreon's Top Down Collection\" by ansimuz on itch.io<br/>\r\n\"Kenny Assets - Sounds\" by Kenny<br/>\r\n\"Simple Pixel UI\" by Jakub Varga on Unity Assetstore</p>\r\nNotes\r\n<p>For whatever reason, I could not get a web build working. I could compile within unity to \"build and run\", but running the build after the fact just doesn't work on any browser.
