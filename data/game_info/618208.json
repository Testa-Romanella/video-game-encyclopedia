But it's very dark in these rooms, and if it wasn't for the beam of light joining you together with the crystal, you wouldn't be able to see anything at all!</p>\n<p>Find your way to the crystals in each room using only that single beam of light and save the universe... or something!</p>\n<p>This is my very first game &amp; game jam (through GMTK 2021), so please let me know what you think of this/things I could do better next time! Hope you have fun with my little colorful game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:45:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a1/7a19b9121220aae53f2ee46f87957c7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Surfdaweb"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
