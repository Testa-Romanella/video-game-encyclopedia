Quickly shuffle your feet over various objects to damage and destroy the slippers before they consume you!\r\n</p>\r\nThe Jam\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis game was created for the \r\n\t@themeatly game jam and I made it in about 40 hours. The game had to be horror and the theme for the jam was \"unlikely evil\" - antagonist had to be a character, object, or situation that is not normally considered evil. So...naturally...I chose bunny slippers :P\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis was my very first game jam so it's pretty rough. I'm still learning how to make games with Unity/C# and it was also my very first attempt at pixel art (and it shows haha). Despite how the game came out, it was an amazing experience and I learned so much! I will definitely be doing more game jams in the future to help me grow as an indie game developer.\r\n</p>\r\nFollow Me\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/HeroPowerEnt<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/heropowerentertainment/<br/>Website: http://www.heropowerent.com/<br/>Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/HeroPowerEnt</p>\n<p>I am on Twitter everyday so you will see the most updates there but feel free to follow me anywhere you like.
