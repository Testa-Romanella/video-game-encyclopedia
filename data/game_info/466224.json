We hard-coded it.)</p>\n<p>Your one means of changing direction (besides bouncing off walls) is a grappling hook. <strong>Aim </strong>with the mouse, and <strong>attach </strong>with the left mouse button. Press escape to <strong>pause </strong>the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Race through the levels as quickly as possible, managing your direction even as your fan boat gets wildly out of control.
