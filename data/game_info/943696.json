And discover if there was ever a way out to begin with.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Play:</strong><br/>You will select your actions in the menu</p>\n<ul><li>[Move] will let you move to another room.</li><li>[Inspect] lets you take a closer at things, and lets you scavenge for\u00a0 items.</li><li>[Interact] Allows you to ether; Talk, Take, or Hit objects.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Lore:<br/></strong>This is my own lore being that these \"backrooms\" is the very labyrinth that were made by Daedalus to trap the Minotaur.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Future Additions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RNG Modifiers:</strong><br/>There is code for a mechanic in the game that allows you to effect the RNG of what you can find in rooms, by increasing a counter for each direction you go. The mechanic will effect the next room's roll for each digit of the room number, that each counter is lower than.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Going Right effects the chance of finding items in objects.</li><li>Going Left effects the chance to find objects in rooms.</li><li>Going forward will randomly multiply the amount of both Left and Right's Counter.</li></ul>\n<p>It was disable for this version cause if you have a good grasp on it than the game will become way easier, but I'm planning of having it be enabled for another game mode you'll be able to select.<br/><br/><strong>More Floors:<br/></strong>Right now there are 2 floors, 0:The Yellow halls 1:The attic. I'm planning on adding three more floors 2-4, With each floor having it own mechanic and things to find to traverse to the next floor. And there will be traveling back and forth between floors.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:<br/></strong>This was left over from my original idea of having this be a starving to death simulator, which would have been faithful to the original Backrooms post. I will be replacing this with \"Advancements\"(not final name) to show you all the key items and secrets you've found in your current round.</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting:<br/></strong>You will be able craft, both in the \"Advancements\" menu, and on objects you find. The first to be added in the future will be; if you have bottled water and a pack of ramen you will be able to cook it on a stove top to make cooked ramen.</p>\n<p><strong>High Score Screen:<br/></strong>At the end of every round you will get a score for everything you've done<strong>;\u00a0</strong>Items found, how many times you've went each direction, ect.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T04:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a3/5a3f976a6df0ede2d36e208adfc6781c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Florx"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
