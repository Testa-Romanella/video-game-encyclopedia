For example, if a player wins a match on a legendary table, they will receive 80% of the total fee paid by all players to play on that table. the table owner gets 8% and the game company 12%.</p>\n<p>Overall, this economy creates a dynamic and engaging experience for players, as they can earn rewards through both gameplay, trading, or owning ERC721 tables, while also supporting the continued development and maintenance of the game. The incentive structure encourages players to pay a higher fee for better tables, while also providing an opportunity for table owners to earn a passive income.</p>\n<p>In Forgotten Chronicles, users can disconnect and reconnect with another device (PC/mobile) and interact directly with the blockchain for paying/receiving/incrementing stake (BNB/FTC)<br/><br/>Check on Testnet Blockchain:\u00a0https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x5fba8dc0e06644a6519772ee5f8ab608af0e7c0c<br/><br/></p><p>Mainnet Ready Smart Contract -\u00a0https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x9f241cdce2753e6181d645082ce5cc2e14450149#c...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T15:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba62c8adc95290811d88f8812e04fe3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ForgottenStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
