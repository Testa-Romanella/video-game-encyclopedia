{"id": 804546, "slug": "deathland-drifters", "name": "Deathland Drifters", "name_original": "Deathland Drifters", "description": "<p>Once a thriving frontier colony, Maatra 2 has been reduced to a crumbling ruin. The scraps of destroyed warships rain down from orbit, crashing onto the planet\u2019s surface before sinking into the murky depths below. The survivors travel across the landscape in hoverships called Drifters, scavenging parts and fuel off fallen wreckage. You have been stranded for countless years, battling for survival against the many dangers of the planet, but now something has changed. A rescue ship has landed on the far side, and you now have one shot at leaving this hellish rock for good.</p>\n<p>PRODUCTION: You can play in the browser, but the HTML5 version does not have any visual effects - it will be a better experience downloading the zip file for your platform.\u00a0 Players can drive around the map and complete the current objective listed in the top right - upon completing the objective, a new one may pop up. Enemies will chase you and fire at you if you are in range or if you damage them. Once the boss is destroyed, that is the end - unfortunately we were not able to add in an end scene/transition.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T23:23:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7f7ba46871b4aa2b078624c0fd8d883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["railgungames", "rangernoodle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
