Blue Team with Master Chief acting as a commanding officer and Fireteam Osiris led by Jameson Locke. Blue Team goes AWOL in order to find Master Chief&#39;s old comrade while Osiris is sent after the Team on a capture and retrieve mission.</p>\n<p>Like in previous titles, the players control a SPARTAN, biologically engineered supersoldiers that use the MJOLNIR battle armor. This armor has energy shields that deplete upon receiving any damage but regenerate after a certain amount of time. The players are capable of carrying two firearms at a time, but it is possible to pick up every weapon dropped by the enemy.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous installments where the player could only be followed by NPCs in singleplayer but had the ability to play in a separate co-op mode, Halo 5 takes the concept further and now every of four fireteam members can be controlled by a player. The game does not feature any autonomous features like split-screen on LAN play.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2015-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-18T10:37:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/77f/77fb27e5b7ec6984f43a70a289376e6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.75, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 70, "owned": 1745, "beaten": 402, "toplay": 74, "dropped": 90, "playing": 18}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 73, "ratings_count": 530, "suggestions_count": 427, "game_series_count": 12, "reviews_count": 537, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": ["343 Industries"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
