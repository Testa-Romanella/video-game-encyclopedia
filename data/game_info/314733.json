Now, that\u2019s my jam!</em></p>\n<p><em>I remember the first one. I always will. Glimmering like a star and as ancient as a civilization long gone. This tiny little piece of metal, forged during times that would never be again, had known centuries of trade, joys and tears. Henceforth useless, purified of all material purpose, what remains of that coin? Just an echo of past lives. Tales.</em></p>\n<p><em>This thinking inspired me with an awe that never left me. I dedicated my entire existence to the \u00ab coin fever \u00bb, exploring the most haunted places to chase ghost currencies. I often wonder how many stories could fit in the palm of my hand.</em></p>\n<p><em>Let\u2019s see!</em></p>\n<p>=============================================<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CoinQuest\u00a0</strong>was made for the Ludum Dare 44 by :</p>\n<p>Bertrand \"Darfeld\" Vi\u00e9-Ducasse : programmation, integration<br/>Camille \"Noune\" Anceau : scenery art, sounds mix, texts<br/>C\u00e9dric \"Poio\" Martin : character art, programmation<br/>Max Morkson : proofreading, title finder</p>\n\n<p>Graphics arts were completely made from scratch with Krita and Piskel<br/>Music &amp; Sounds were gathered on\u00a0Universal-soundbank\u00a0and mixed with Audacity<br/>Black Chancery Font\u00a0by Earl Allen/Doug Miles</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Version details :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>1.0: released 7 minutes before the end.
