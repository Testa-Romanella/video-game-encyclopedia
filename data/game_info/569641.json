Match two items and get a score. If you select two non-matching items they will hide again.<br/></p>\n<p>The game features six difficulty levels from 20\u00a0items (10 pairs) to 64 items (32 pairs).</p>\n<p><strong>System requirements</strong>: 64 bit OS: Windows 7, 8 (not tested), Windows 10 or Linux (not tested). Graphics card and monitor capable of 1920 x 1080 (Full HD). Mouse. Approx. 150 MB free disk space, less than 1 GB free memory needed.  <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: Mouse only<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The game can be downloaded for free, and is considered freeware. There are no limits to using it, except you can't resell the game.<br/></p>\n<p>I would appreciate it if you would consider paying a bit for the game, though.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to</strong>: Godot Engine for the game engine, BornCG for inspiration, Rexard for making the Fantasy Badges art pack, 1001freefonts.com for many great fonts, and Humble Bundle for offering great assets and more.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:38:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e7/9e7049ee93122a97be874baceb920c8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Straaberg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
