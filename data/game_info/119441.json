How many Yellow Mysteries can you collect using nothing but your trusty flashlight? The controls are simple - mouse to look around, WASD to move, and mash the spacebar to sprint. How long can you last? (Just a disclaimer, there are no jump scares or extremely loud noises. However, those pesky mugwumps do like to hide behind trees, and it is kinda dark)</p><p>Update log:</p><p>12/25: Did some major optimizing and fixed it so the sounds would work as intended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/648/6485377d4024a0ab9a619a579e050c07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["313group"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
