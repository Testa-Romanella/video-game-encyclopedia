It was published by Toho in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as part of the Aleste series. In a traditional fashion, the player pilots a spaceship through a variety of locales crawling with enemy squadrons to shoot down, though the story in the Japanese version is different from American and European ones. However, Super Aleste also offers a \"Short Game\", where only a set of small levels are played, with the emphasis on scoring as many points as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3ee6019f94c7b6f652dedf7bd14b9b17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Compile"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Toho"], "esrb_rating": null}
