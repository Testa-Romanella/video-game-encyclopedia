You are Pandora, the mastermind behind a game where everyone puts their life on the line. Your goal is simple: you must figure out the traitor and kill them, then end the game before someone figures out you are the one behind their abduction and kills <strong>you</strong>. Will you manage to manipulate everyone's trust to fulfill your plans? Or will you fail and be erased? Even the mastermind behind a death game does not always know how the events will go...<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Solve puzzles and hack for information!</strong> As the mastermind of the death game, you have the ability to hack into other characters' helmets to see what they see and hear what they hear. Use that knowledge to keep ahead of the participants!<br/></li><li><strong>Use \"TRUST\" to radically change the story!</strong> By making different choices, you can change which characters you have built trust with, which will lead to different outcomes. Only by trying different things will you attain new story routes!<br/></li><li><strong>Mandatory autosaving: choices matter!</strong> Once you've made a choice for your save file, that choice is locked in. Be sure to weight your choices or else you may end up with outcomes you can't simply rewind out of! Thankfully, the game comes equipped with <strong>24 file slots</strong> to let you retry over and over!<br/></li><li><strong>One flowchart to use with each new file!</strong> Equipped with a complex flowchart, you can change your choices on the fly in any new blank save file as long as all trust-changing options for a given choice have been previously done. You can think of it as one bigger puzzle where you change choices to access new routes and dive in at any unlocked point! YOU are in control of the flow.<br/></li><li><strong>The game remembers what you've done!</strong> While each save file is a separate route, the game takes into account all that you've done and remembers. Perhaps even, revisiting older saves at a later time may unlock additional content for that file...<br/></li><li><strong>This is the second entry of the ABiMe franchise, but...</strong> you can play it before playing the first one. To provide the full experience, be on the lookout for the <strong>Head AS Code</strong> title!</li></ul><br/>Note: Only 16:9 ratio is supported for fullscreen option.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-26T19:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb1/eb1c04657fd39366624ee0e3207d6ea7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miracle Moon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Miracle Moon"], "esrb_rating": null}
