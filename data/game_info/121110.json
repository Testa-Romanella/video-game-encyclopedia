The goal is to make delicious poutines by laying down fries, cheese curds and gravy.</p><p>Player one can press SPACE to throw bacon, player two uses ENTER. Bacon stuns your opponent for a second, having food fall on the other player makes them lose two seconds. You have 30 seconds to get as many points as you can, may the best lumberjack chief win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/143/143e6b89865d2636d8bbf261a54ec651.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["poik007"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
