Think about what you do, the world is gonna do the same to you.</p>\n<p>The theme of duality is shown in our game through game mechanics. Your powers are there to help you but at the same time you are limited in your abilities. The world respons to your actions by mirroring them on you. If you are not careful, you just might run out of powers at all, and will simply become another victim of this world. The odds are against you, good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T08:14:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/357/3577e7bcc778ad6b112af7c3c9e8ae8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["McZeddy", "Spiderbrood", "Yali Li", "kebabjr", "Vlada Morgun", "sonyanils"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
