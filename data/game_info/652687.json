And if you manage to survive, you can always upgrade yourself with parts from fallen enemies and look the part as well!<br/><br/>Procedurally generated levels in different settings with different enemies. An online high score table that keeps track of your highest score to compete with other aspiring champions.</p>\n<p>Balance is probably still somewhat missing, so I'm open to all feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T03:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf69f38d5342ba235fe3918a625bdfb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chaotic Good Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
