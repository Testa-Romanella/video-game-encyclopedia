As the mother wolf you are tasked in communicating with other creatures in the world to find your lost cubs.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In this project i was in charge of the programming side of it all, this includes the wolf being able to move sprint and jump along with the ability to pick up the fruits and other items. Personally most of these objectives that i have set for myself impressed me as much as it did for the others because some aspects i worked on for the first time. Scripting is a very rewarding skill once everything starts working the way it should<br/>Later on during the development after the scripting was where it was supposed to be, i worked on designing the level and added many different details such as the foliage and logs scattered along the floor. In addition to this i was able to test and do some bug fixes near the end of the project.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T12:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be2/be2ff1e4abd53b87799986d75f7b0e90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShaneFitzpatrick"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
