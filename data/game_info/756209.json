The rooms can be joined by up to 4 players. More players in room increases difficulty by giving less time to translate words from polish to english. The game has 2 modes. One of them increases the difficulty by adding turrets that shoot freezing projectiles. Game can be restarted after loss or after defeating the enemy from the same room.</p>\n<p>This game is my first project that I've completed. Currently the Photon servers can host 20 concurrent users.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T10:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa1/fa1f9885d96f64cadd98dd705888f2f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdamWenckaProd"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
