Use left, down and right arrow keys. If you successfully hit the notes you accelerate, if you miss you decelerate.</p>\n<p>The story is about a racer who had an accident in a race 4 years ago. He/she thinks it's the time to get back to racing but like the day accident happened it's raining.\u00a0I wanted to make the game atmospheric as much as I can.
