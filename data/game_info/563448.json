In this intense battle, players fight to be the last one alive.\u00a0 The\u00a0\u00a0screen might appear to be going slow at first, but don't get to comfortable because it will speed up, slow down and change direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Features / Goals</strong></p>\n<p>This project is still in development and will continue to regularly receive updates.\u00a0 The section that follows this will cover some of the things our team has implemented along with some of our goals for those features.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>The Map</em></p>\n<p>This game features procedural map generation.\u00a0 Our goal is to create premade chunks of varying difficulty that get randomly placed in throughout the map.\u00a0 These chunks will be themed according to our four different map zones.\u00a0 These zones are Sci-Fi, Medieval, Rainbow, Lava. The players will traverse through a zone travel through a portal and appear at a new setting.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Multiplayer</em></p>\n<p>Our goal is to turn the tradition platformer experience into a\u00a0 exciting fast paced party game.\u00a0 You will battle your friends to the death! You can push your friends into obstacles or out of the map to kill them and secure your self victory.\u00a0 Each individual game will be about a five minute or less experience so if you die you will not be sitting out for long.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T04:35:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa8/fa8f98102024cf55a2582aeb2fac9a8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["superfallbros"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
