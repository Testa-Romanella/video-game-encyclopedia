Viewer discretion is advised.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Ascendance is a text-based fantasy love story about the first contact between humanity and the extraterrestrial beings known as The Y.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Though the premise is a very fertile (and fun!) ground for sci-fi, Ascendance is inspired by several concepts from different spiritualist philosophies, as well as by great fantasy stories, so it might bring a different perspective for you!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Oh! Don\u2019t put on such a thoughtful face...it\u2019s going to be fun!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re an ordinary college student who is simply trying to make it through your college days and graduate. Your life isn\u2019t eventful and you don\u2019t particularly excel at anything. On what looks like an ordinary day, something completely out of character happens in the middle of a lecture. Are you ready to ascend, or will you turn your back to the unknown?</p>\n\n<ul><li>Customize your mc (name, gender, physical appearance).\r\n</li><li>Shape your mc\u2019s personality through choices.\r\n</li><li>Befriend or pursue a relationship with three contrasting love interests.\r\n</li><li>Choose the division you\u2019ll join to help shape the new world (Or choose not to join any *evil grin intensifies*).\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Elya |\u00a0</strong>He/Him | 1,91m | X y.o. | Born in\u00a064\u00b034'41.91\" N 17\u00b053'17.65\" E, Jupiter.</p>\n<p>Elya is highly intelligent and extraordinarily good at dealing with people. Although frequently being perceived as calm, kind and protective, great part of Elya\u2019s talent is being able to easily change his behavior to adapt to different situations, as he sees convenient. Who is Elya, when no one\u2019s looking?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Ian Ishihara | </strong>He/Him | 1,8m |\u00a024 y.o. | Born in Yokohama, Japan, Earth.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ian is a free spirit. Being very bright, impulsive and playful, Ian has little to no respect for social conventions that don\u2019t have a clear purpose. People will often describe him as charming and seductive but, in reality, Ian rarely flirts with anyone. Curious, isn\u2019t it?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Joana | </strong>She/Her | 1,73m | X y.o. | Born in\u00a0-19\u00b001'0.92\" S 29\u00b009'10.09\" E, Jupiter.\r\n</p>\n<p>Joana might be the strongest, most determined being you\u2019ll ever meet. Since she is very serious about her duty and devoted to her division, most of The Y find Joana intangible. Legend has it, though, that whenever she arrives to assist those in need, rays of sunshine can be seen, no matter the time of day. Could it be?\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>This project is still in a very early stage of development</strong></em><em>!</em>\n</p>\n<p>In the early demo, you\u2019ll get to meet the characters cited above briefly and get a gist of how the story is going to go!
