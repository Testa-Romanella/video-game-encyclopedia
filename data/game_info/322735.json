How long can you keep running before the blaze consumes you too?</p>\n<p>Incaendium (in-KEN-dee-um) is a game\u00a0made by two third-year games design students as part of our final university project!</p>\n<p>(This game was designed with touchscreen controls in mind, but if you're playing the Windows version, the mouse cursor works exactly the same as a finger/stylus on a touchscreen.)</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Blueprinting/game development by myself</li><li>Art by Grace Collas:</li><ul><li>Instagram: @NothinButNoodles</li><li>Twitter: @ImThatGrace</li><li>ArtStation</li><li>Redbubble</li></ul><li>Music and sound effects from freesound.org</li></ul>\n<p>Follow us on Twitter at @IncaendiumGame!</p>\n\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<ul><li>Major bug: It's rare, but it's possible that the deer may suddenly disappear, which in addition to breaking the gameplay also\u00a0results in a sudden and jarring camera angle change. If this happens, open the pause menu and restart the game.</li><li>Major bug: Another rare bug, but occasionally the deer will suddenly stop receiving input from the mouse cursor/touchscreen. However, the UI/HUD still receives input, so if this happens, open the pause menu and restart the game.</li><li>Minor bug: Purely cosmetic, but sometimes the background trees get out of sync with the season changes, usually ending up retaining their spring appearance. However, this has no effect on gameplay.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Note: Incaendium is optimised for display at a\u00a04:3 aspect ratio. It still works fine with other aspect ratios, but some parts of the main menu may be stretched/offset.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:18:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69d/69d70b2cd6b1453cb7ffb160f19e1783.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["glitchsaur"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
