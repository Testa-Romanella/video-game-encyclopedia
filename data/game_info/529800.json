Inspired from classics like Tekken or Street fighter, the goal is to go in the mind of the bored, and imagining how he can waste the time he have to spare. That's right, hand fight.\u00a0Right vs Left. Nothing political. Just a guy and two hands.\u00a0</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Combos works like specific strings. One mistake and recovery will hit you. It can be neutral, neutral + direction or heavy. Remember that the hands will always face each others, so directions swaps ! The first attack for each combinaison is always the same, and it becomes more diverse once you discovered the combos.<br/>Statistics are like this :\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n          Strength\r\n            Indicates the raw power of the character. Higher it is, less it's affected by the weight of its item. Increases pushes and stun effects, plus making paring more effective.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Agility\r\n            Indicates the recovery reduction and pary rate.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Speed\r\n            Indicates the jump height and movement speed\r\n        \r\n          \r\n          Weight\r\n            Indicates the weight of its weapon.
