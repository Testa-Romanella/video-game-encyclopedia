Be careful when clearing your path on foot, or switching the tracks direction, because Charles might be waiting for you.<br />\nUpgrade you train to fit your needs.</p>\n<p>Go looting or complete missions to find &quot;Scraps&quot;, which can be used to turn your train, into a death machine on wheels.<br />\nGet help from the townspeople.</p>\n<p>Help out the settlers in return for high powered weapons, and other items vital to Charles&#39; destruction.<br />\nFight Charles to the death.</p>\n<p>Prove yourself a worthy train killer, by gaining enough strength, firepower, and skill to take down the mechanical terror once and for all.</p>\n<p>In Choo-Choo Charles you&#39;re given the task of eradicating a monster known by the locals as &quot;Charles&quot;. Nobody knows where he came from, but they know why; to eat the flesh of puny humans. You have a small yellow train, with a map, mounted machine gun, and an exquisite collection of bobble-heads on the dashboard. You&#39;ll use this train to get from place to place, while you complete missions for the townspeople, or loot scraps from around the island. Over time you\u2019ll use your scraps to upgrade your train\u2019s speed, armor, and damage. You\u2019ll grow your arsenal, and (hopefully) become an unstoppable force, ready to take on the great and mighty Charles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-18T05:22:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2d3/2d3ca1ee050ba31996d11124b6021bf1.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/TwoStarGames", "rating": 3.31, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 63, "beaten": 28, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 7, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 32, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Two Star Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Two Star Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
