{"id": 762635, "slug": "krystalz", "name": "Krystalz", "name_original": "Krystalz", "description": "<p>Krystalz is a game about a guy that goes on a journey. Now, you probably expect me to say something like \"But this isn't any normal journey!\"<br/>You'd be half right. Sure, it's not normal. For the most part. The wacky heroes present here have a tendency to experience wacky wednesdays. Usually. This cast involves characters who are just as eccentric as the last, and because of that, a host of 'interesting' and 'very cool' conversations happen, of which none include any fourth wall breaking. I wouldn't lie to you, would I?<br/><br/>It's a short (does between 3-4 hours count as short?), for now, game made in rpg maker, because I have no skill, even though the protagonists clearly do. Complete up to about the last overworld dungeon, which is still in progress (for now), Krystalz features a linear story with effectively only two sidequests at the moment.<br/><br/>Cast includes, but is not limited to: Hero (Reluctant), Sorceress (She's very strong), Thief(?), Cat (He's afraid of mice) and more.\u00a0<br/>Progression system is effectively fine for the most part, and hey, if you have something to say about it, comments are open for feedback. I'm no wimp.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T17:02:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/063/063430524987184e9feba677022295ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mysterymage"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
