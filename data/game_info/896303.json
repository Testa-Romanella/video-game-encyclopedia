She has an OC called Linnid which has a design that I love. In fact, I love the OC design so much that I offered her a few pixel arts and this game !\r\nI initially offered this game on November 11th, because that's what her birthday stated on her DeviantArt profile. But as it turns out, her birthday is actually on December 12th. So I decided to publish Flappy Linnid at her actual birthday !\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Despite being like Furikan's Flappy Bird, it has a few differences :</strong><br/>- Linnid is bigger than the bird, so her hit detection is bigger (supposedly).<br/>- The pipes are now a bit further away from each other.<br/>- An extra type of Piranha Plants added, which can move upwards.</p>\n\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the game screen or press the Spacebar to flap Linnid.\r\n</p>\n<p>Traverse between vertical pipes to earn points. If you touch a pipe, you'll fall and the game is over.\r\n</p>\n<p>The gap between pipes are wide. But the more points you earn, the narrower the gap would be.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Bullet Bills pushes you back when you touch them. So be careful not to touch them too much !\r\n</p>\n<p>If you left the screen to the left side or touch the ground, you'll lose.\r\n</p>\n<p>The mushrooms allows you to go further. The more you are to the left side of the screen, the more mushrooms they'll appear.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some Piranha Plants came out from pipes. If you touch their green vines, you'll lose speed, those pushing you to the left side of the screen. But if you their their heads, you'll lose.</p>\n\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\n<p>LINNID CREATED BY : Ainddos</p>\n<p>ORIGINAL GAME, ASSETS AND SOUND EFFETS CREATED BY : Dong Nguyen\r\n</p>\n<p>MUSIC REMIXED FROM : <strong>Chronologie 4</strong> by Jean-Michel Jarre\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T20:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/471/4714dd5afc5598167289464b87042c2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Furrican"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
