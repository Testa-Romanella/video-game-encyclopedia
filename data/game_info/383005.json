I see potential for a puzzle game!</p>\n<p>The jam theme was \"Dimension Change\", so I took the axe throwing mechanic of Kratos from God Of War and I made it into a 2D Boomerang.</p>\n\n<p>The puzzle is that you have to kill all the enemies but your boomerang does not affect them, you have to interact with the environment of the game to kill the enemies while still keeping your way to the goal clear!</p>\n\n<p>It is only two levels due to time constraints, I managed to make another level when the time got extended.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Controls are WASD/Arrow Keys and the Mouse.\u00a0</strong></li><li><strong>Left Mouse Button to throw the boomerang.</strong></li><li><strong>Right Mouse Button to call back the boomerang.</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Art and Code by yours truly (me), this was made using Unity</strong></p>\n<p>You can check out my art pages and github!</p>\n<p>https://github.com/gitnader/<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/nadersart/</p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/nadera<br/></p>\n<p><strong>https://www.deviantart.com/smickies<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Credtis:</strong></p>\n<p>Music: https://www.bensound.com<br/>Font:\u00a0\u00a0\"Alphabetized Cassette Tapes\" is a font created and copyrighted by Brittney Murphy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:01:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b2929dd800b2a29b9dece9c1cd500583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael A"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
