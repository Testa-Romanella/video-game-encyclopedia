Explore an expansive and open world, upgrade your technology, and fight your way off the planet!<h3>Explore a Strangely Beautiful Alien Planet</h3><br/>You work for the most frugal aerospace company out there, Craterbound Industries. Unfortunately for you, your mission has lived up to the company's name once again. You have crash-landed on the alien world of Brahe-5, filled with dangerous creatures and rolling hills.<h3>Fight, Kill, Mine</h3><br/>On Brahe-5 it is kill or be killed. Luckily for you, your company has provided you with moderately adequate weapons. Your multitool can be used both to dissolve conquered enemies and take their resources.<h3>Craft, Upgrade, Repair</h3><br/>You start out with just a basic shelter and tools. Your only means of escape is miles away, and your oxygen is limited. Use the resources you collect from the planet's wildlife to upgrade your suit, improve your tools, and repair your cruiser.<h3>Deploy Shelters and Outposts</h3><br/>Brahe-5 is a big planet, and you will need shelter to survive the creature attacks and replenish your ever-diminishing oxygen supply. Construct habitats in order to fabricate upgrades, store resources, and fend off attacks.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T03:52:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17c/17ced22def4884bd9ae48e35abda9950.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Marquez"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Daniel Marquez"], "esrb_rating": null}
