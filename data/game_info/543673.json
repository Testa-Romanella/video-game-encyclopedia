To talk to people in the game, walk close to them and click on them\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. When it's time to proceed to the next level, there's a sign below the town center where Harald is to the far left if you follow the path\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. This is not a finished/ polished product, it's still a prototype (you might notice this due to lack of animations/ bugs/ lack of music). So thank you for your time and feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T07:12:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f58/f586252881a7b1fca43536c851d81e11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revna"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
