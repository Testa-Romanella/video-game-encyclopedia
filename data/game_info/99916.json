Don't forget to talk with them and various times!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tKnown issues\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSome NPCs in interiors where there is a fireplace, if they walk near the fire, the fire appears over them. I don't really know how to solve it, because if I change it, it would be the player who would have the issue.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSome animals are configurated as passables due to their little size (chicks, lizards, little serpents...). These animals have the issue that also can walk over walls (well, over all the map). I don't really know how to solve it, because to change it would mean that you couldn't pass over them, and that would be very bad.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe worlds of Midyanin and Helrriand should have a rain cycle. I have been testing a script for hours, and my conclusion is that it works when it wants. As I am not programmer, it is really difficult for me to work with scripts, although that one is not the only one I've used. So, if you see rain in those two worlds, don't surprise. And if you don't see, it's not a real problem.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tVideos about the lore\r\n</p> <p><strong>Buy the Soundtrack</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0d/d0dd5cca29f8c655b7709faa47f60f3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fegefeueranilmathiel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
