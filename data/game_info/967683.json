Guide the crew across islands of a post-flood world known as \u2018Saltsea\u2019. Explore strange and wonderful communities, uncover a deep conspiracy, choose where to go and which crew members to investigate with, and chart a journey through twists and turns, difficulties and delights.<br />\nA Post-Flood World<br />\nVisit different island communities as you investigate the mystery at the heart of the game. Each built on pre-flood ruins \u2013 in beautiful and beguiling ways.<br />\nAs you explore you will uncover different pathways through a rich and varied series of islands. This flooded world, betrayed by the so-called Hoarders, barely remembers a time before the Flood. They rebuilt on the ruins of what came before, and new talents and technologies took the place of the old. Many surprises await!<br />\nChoose Your Priorities<br />\nIn Saltsea Chronicles you guide the entire crew through the story. As well as investigating the mystery of your captain\u2019s disappearance, you will uncover secrets, create and resolve tensions between the crew, and add to your number as you meet others who ask to join you.<br />\nEach chapter, you pick which island to visit and who to send on the expedition. Your choices will unlock different content, develop relationships, and give you a chance to resolve (and create) tensions within the crew.<br />\nWith a lightning-fast navigation system, you\u2019re free to hop around the islands as you explore. Choose between short and snappy observations, or dig deep into conversations with your crewmate or the locals, exploring the islands across different times of day.<br />\nUncover a Conspiracy<br />\nWas your captain kidnapped? Or did she leave of her own free will? Keep track of the mystery in Murl\u2019s Log and collect records of your encounters as stickers in the Almanac.<br />\nDifferent playthroughs will take you to different islands, introduce different characters and have dramatic consequences for your crew.
