The actions of the different games are connected, so, you have to time each move to success in all games at the same time. Is very difficult the first time until your mind gets used to this kind of multitasking.</p>\n<p>Try to get the high score possible!</p>\n<p>Note: I made this game to learn Godot, but I think that is good enough to give you fun for a few minutes. Any feedback is welcome!</p>\n<p>Thanks to\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/\u00a0for the assets!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f9/0f9f209eb01412bc1dce04ab628c28cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gefarion"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
