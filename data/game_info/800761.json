Click the boss to hit them, allies or yourself to select for heals.</p>\n<p>This was my final big project for my degree in Games Design and Development. In every project where I am given free direction to make what I want, I always challenge myself to learn something new or something that bothered me on the previous project and I went into this project to learn VFX. I now have a pretty basic understanding of how to make them, at least with VFX graphs but this project also faced a lot of other challenges because I more or less fully scripted it by hand instead of following tutorials.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm quite stubborn and always try to use as little material that isn't mine as possible to avoid needing to make references. The ultimate lesson I learned from this was I really should stop holding myself back like that so much, as once I enabled myself to use Mixamo to get a model with animations, that huge hurdle was so much less of a problem and frankly, I was never into modelling/animation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T16:08:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/996/996d580f00039f9c1e39385232bf11b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JustDamo"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
