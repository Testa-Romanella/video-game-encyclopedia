I was noodling about with some sprites on Sunday night and decided the player ship needed to be in a game. So I took a break from working on Funfair Inc. (Theme Park port) for the C64 to make this. It locks up occasionally, there wasn't time to fix that for the jam - hopefully I can track that down for a post-jam version.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Slow enemy = 5\u00a0</li><li>Fast enemy = 10</li><li>Clear entire wave = 200</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>UP = Up Arrow</li><li>DOWN = Down Arrow</li><li>Z = Fire</li></ul>\n<p>....or joystick in Port 2 on a real C64/emulator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:02:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a46/a46091b28e45296795dd58ec3014ccd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
