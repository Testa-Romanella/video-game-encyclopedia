Playsets contain a variety of character goals, locations, places and relationships, which you can use as a group to tell stories about everything from bank heists gone wrong to historical dramas. This app will have periodic updates consisting of more playsets.\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>FiascoMobile only contains playsets, and not the core rules for the game.
