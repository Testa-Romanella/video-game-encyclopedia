I'm an independent developer who likes to develop and perfect games for optimal enjoyment and replayability (this is quite important to me). I like to make tutorial levels as short as possible (unless they are deliberately engaging), and make sure dialogue doesn't run too long. It's nice to meet you!</p>\n<p>I handle all the programming, scriptwriting, artwork, music, etc. so I greatly appreciate any donations you may give. And with enough donations, I will be able to finish the game and add more features which may\u00a0enhance the game's overall experience.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T09:21:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5e/f5ed61482d79cb173c53917b9a334c76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1lifer"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
