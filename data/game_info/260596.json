(U\u2022\u0300\u1d25\u2022\u0301U)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>LatteGay</strong> is a Gay\u2122 visual novel about the trials and tribulations of working in a coffee shop. And dating your coworkers or customers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This demo is a side story to a larger planned VN, and follows the journey of two possible love interests if neither of them are romanced. <strong>Marllie</strong> spends all her free time in the Daily grind working on... whatever it is. To <strong>Blake</strong>, the newbie, she's the one customer that sends her into a panic with her impossible orders.</p>\n<p>They'll have to overcome awkward conversations, exasperated friends and disastrous flirting\u00a0on their journey to become something more.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the cute dogs might help a little bit.</p>\n<p>(Doubt it though. Blake and Marllie are pretty useless.)</p><p><strong>This is our group's first project and is currently in development still. Please comment with feedback. We really appreciate that.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/91480b9c3dacb76d985f9f3951fdde3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["HuffleDuck", "hiddenlairs", "magicalzebra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
