Quick thinking and keen awareness are required to take out the highly trained semi-intelligent soldiers you will be facing in battle.<br/><br/><strong>Over 25 Weapons</strong><br/>Equip Rocket Launchers, Submachine Guns, Assault Rifles, IEDs, Knives, Sawed-Off Shotty's, Light Machine Guns, Grenades, and Pistols (duh) as your primary and secondary weapons. Send lead beams of self-righteousness and cleansing fire straight through your opposition who are probably the bad guys.<br/><br/><strong>Environments</strong><br/>Fight your way through a variety of maps and lighting conditions. Play in the dark for an added challenge or to RP that you are at a rave. Equip Night Vision goggles or use your flashlight to see where that ******* Frank is hiding.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Semi-Intelligent AI</strong><br/>The AI will engage you in intense firefights that may leave you with lifelong(ingame time) trauma or no life at all. Enemies will take cover, camp at vantage points, tactically retreat, and rush you head on. Keep your head on a swivel to avoid being turned into pixel soup by snipers, radicalized 9-5ers, and ninjas.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Bullet Penetration</strong><br/>Bullets can sometimes penetrate furniture, riot shields, doors, and various objects in your environment depending on the weapon you choose. Don't get too comfortable hiding behind that flipped table.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Outsmart your N-emies</strong><br/>Every encounter with an enemy is like a small, rapidly evolving puzzle. Use your wits to take up an advantageous position to snipe or rush an enemy while they are most vulnerable.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Zombonies</strong><br/>They're vicious. They're stupid. They have ridiculous names. And they're coming for you. Use half your wits to dispatch a horde of hungry yeller N green fellers from feasting on your sweet cheeks.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Tailor Your Experience</strong><br/>Change the settings to increase difficulty, dim the lighting, enable survival mode, change the amount of soldiers, available air support, score limit, player/soldier loadouts, change team uniform colors, make a really boring 1v1 on a large map, start a FFA squad battle, face zombies, or any combination of settings you're into. Whether it's sniping from a rooftop, gunning down your enemies head on, or coercing your loved ones to buy this game, Play Your Way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T03:39:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecfc93699ee96dfe83209cf8c98853b2.jpg", "website": "https://www.instagram.com/datquinso/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Datquinso"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Datquinso"], "esrb_rating": null}
