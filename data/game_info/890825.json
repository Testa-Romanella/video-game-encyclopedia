Thus it is of course not perfect. Nonetheless, I spent about 2 months working on this. I am an aspiring game creator and every tiny bit of feedback keeps me going. Really be honest. Tell me about each flaw so that I can improve it in my next one. Thank you so much for visiting this page and I hope you enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed making it.</p>\n\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>In this Walking sim, nothing is out of hand. Featuring 7 Endings, deep lore, and a retro/arcade Graphic style. You will have a pleasant and calm adventure with nothing but silence guiding you and your Ai companion.
