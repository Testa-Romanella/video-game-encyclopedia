This determines the direction of attacks, movements, and the like!</p>\n<p>- Attack treasure chests!</p>\n<p>- Sometimes its best to just draw a card and skip your turn!</p>\n<p>- If you fall onto an enemy, you'll deal it damage and bounce off! This is the key to victory!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>- Use your mouse to drag cards from your hand to the right or left of your character to play them.</p>\n<p>- To draw a card and skip your turn, press enter or click on the deck.</p>\n<p>- Drag a card to the \"Shred\" icon to remove it from your deck forever. Doing so will let you draw a card. You can only do this once per turn.</p>\n<p>TURN ORDER:</p>\n<p>- After you play a card, the enemies in the area will move, then the traps in the area will tick.</p>\n<p>CARD ABILITIES:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- \"Quick\" means the card won't take up your turn.</p>\n<p>- \"Attack\" swings your spear in the direction you played the card.</p>\n<p>- \"Move\" moves that many cells in the direction you played the card.</p>\n<p>- \"Warp\" places you in a space that many cells away in the direction you played the card.</p>\n<p>- \"Jump\" hops you up that many cells.</p>\n<p>- \"Fall\" makes you fall that many cells.</p>\n<p>- \"Draw\" draws that many cards.</p>\n<p>- \"Pain\" hurts you that much.</p>\n<p>- \"Drain\" heals you that much.</p>\n<p>Coding by Andrew Jones</p>\n<p>Art by Joe Hanna @joehasdiedgames\r\ntwitter.com/joehasdiedgames</p>\n<p>Music by Micah Jones\r\ntwitter.com/backontheteam</p>\n<p>We used this great font:\r\nhttps://managore.itch.io/m3x6</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebb7ee5951e7a803ba053a3094f7c15f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Strange Spaces"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
