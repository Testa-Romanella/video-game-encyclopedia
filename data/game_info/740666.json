Most workplace abuse \u2014 generally rooted in an insecure boss\u00a0feeling threatened by a competent, ethical subordinate \u2014 involves undermining confidence and performance by isolating and putting the target down. Abuse of power generally takes the form of verbal abuse or sabotage but can involve any form of physical, mental, social, or financial mistreatment. When it escalates to group or organizational abuse, it becomes mobbing. Abuse at work has a discriminatory impact as it is experienced more often by women, non-white workers, workers over 40, workers with disabilities, and workers in the LGBTQ community \u2014 or anyone \"othered\" by those in power.</p>\n<p>DignityTogether.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T08:31:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/485/485567312dd73b837896927be6da8a88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dfalzoi"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
