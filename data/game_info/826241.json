The player can choose which bees are born next and influence how many flowers get found or how much nectar is collected.</p>\n<p>For the procedural world generation I started with an icosahedron that i subdivided and extruded sides\u00a0and added faces where needed to get the flat edged look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The object placement was made with a cellular automaton that set starting health values to each face that represents land. Afterwards it itteratively changes the values to either spread the health to neighbouring faces or reduce health of faces that are cut off from other healthy faces. In the end the objects are placed on faces that have enough health to accomodate them.</p>\n<p>There are four kind of bees in Plan Bee and all of their AIs have been\u00a0\u00a0made with behaviour trees. There are <strong>searcher bees</strong> that fly out and scout for new flowers, when they are hungry or night falls they return to inform the bee stock of the flowers. With this information the <strong>gatherer bees</strong>\u00a0can go to the flowers and gather their nectar until they can't hold any nectar anymore, night falls or the flower doesn't have any nectar left. After they returned to the bee stock <strong>worker bees\u00a0</strong>help them unload the nectar. When they are not unloading nectar they build new hives to accomodate new bees. New bees are born from a <strong>queen bee</strong> that birthes new bees until she gets hungry and rests. After a critical mass is reached a new queen bee is assigned and she founds a new bee stock and takes half the stock with her. Implementing A* algorithm on an icosahedron was a pain, that's for sure.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>I would love to receive feedback on\u00a0what you think about this showcase!
