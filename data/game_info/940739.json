However, what I did run out of time for was a way to balance the difficulty of the game, so it's a bit hard. It's also possible to die during transitions. There is also only 8 level layouts, one a little bigger than the rest, so it is possible that you will get the same level multiple times. <strong>This is an infinite highscore game, and does not save your score</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:</strong> <em>The button on the Game Over screen does work, although not in the export. Not sure why, but 1 minute won't be enough time to work it out. Also, an exclamation mark should appear when an enemy spots you, although sometimes it doesn't.</em></p>\n<p>The Maze is a game where you traverse a shadowy maze teeming with enemies. Use your lures to distract them, and search for the key to unlock the door.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Movement - WASD or Arrow Keys<br/>Shoot lure/Select - Left Mouse Button<br/></p>\n<p><em>Music: Science Music - TimTaj (freemusicarchive)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T11:38:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/977c3a0903cab1e24247b8b4718b8710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Okau"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
