It is late at night by the time you find your way high up on the mountain to the remote cabin, and you are the first to arrive. You fall asleep by the crackling fire you built with the few logs available inside. When you wake up, the fire has died down to embers and you hear a whistling noise outside. A glance out the window reveals a whiteout blizzard that has created 4- to 6-foot drifts of snow. There is no cell phone reception, and the landline in the cabin appears to no longer work\u2026</em><br/></p>\n<p>Mountaintop Isolation is a solo GM-less journaling game in which you will document your time trapped isolated and alone in a mountaintop cabin. While succumbing to the elements is the most likely outcome, survival and escape down the mountain isn\u2019t completely impossible. The game is intended to be challenging and thought-provoking as you write out your character\u2019s story.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, you will roll dice, draw cards from the oracle deck, and pull blocks from the tower (with optional rules for those without a tumbling block tower), and record your experiences for posterity.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warnings</strong></p>\n<p>This game includes themes of fear, isolation, suspense, despair, bullying, claustrophobia, starvation, paranoia, mental instability, and potential death, including freezing to death.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Mountaintop Isolation</em> is game that explores the darker and more intimate themes of survival. It is encouraged to take breaks and make safety checks with yourself along the way. If any of the cards or themes ever become overwhelming, please skip over them and make sure to check in with yourself. Please prioritize your safety over the completion of the game. As always, be kind to yourself and self-care.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T07:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fdf4d698fa156c138a72388505eae39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["La Lionne Publishing"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
