The fish are controlled by different flocking algorithms and if you attack one fish in a flock, the whole swarm will attack you. So to prevent that, you swim into a flock and split it up so the fish are in their own. Now you can eat them in without worries because they are weaker alone.\u00a0 Please leave a comment for feedback as it really helps me out. I hope you enjoy my game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T14:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9dbcd14df7dacf0b13511aacbd87ecd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Schnitzel Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
