Arrow keys 'left' and 'right' move you side to side, but if you press space, you fire your lasers! Use these wisely, and be sure not to waste them, because you can run out! The red circles are the bad guys! Shoot them any chance you get! If you let one collide into you, you will lose health, so make sure you don't miss them or run out of ammo! Don't worry too much if you run out of ammo, you may just be able to recover! Every so often, boxes will drop from the mists of the polygonal universe! In these boxes? Ammo! You may just be able to recover!</p>\n<p>As you get better at the game, and your score improves, the enemies will come faster, so make sure you are prepared!</p>\n<ul><li>Shoot your way through a procedurally speeding up arcade game!</li><li>Manage your ammo properly, and ammo drops will spin their way to you every 30 seconds!</li><li>Count your score! The higher your score, the faster the game!</li><li>Available now!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a24/a24917d5c06abfae6412e24ab8cffe73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Coffee Guy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
