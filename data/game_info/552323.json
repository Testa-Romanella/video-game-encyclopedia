Because of this I decided to focus on learning how to complete a project, using assets found on the asset store [listed below].   </p>\n<p>Through programming (using Bolt), designing the terrain, building the dialogue system (through Bolt), laying out the level and reaching the (somewhat dubious) finish line I have learnt a great deal. And, thankfully, that's exactly what I came into this Jam hoping for.   </p>\n<p>I hope the game can be a calm breath of fresh air. <br/></p>\n\r\nDetails\r\n<p>Unfortunately, due being totally new, I failed to optomise the game for WebGL or Mac, as such it's only on Windows--at least for now.   </p>\n<p>Please do let me know if you encounter any bugs. <br/></p>\n\r\nAssets\r\nModels\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Textures \r\n<p>Low Poly Animated Animals by PolyPerfect https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/low-poly-animated-an...   </p>\n<p>Krabs the Crab by Polydactyl https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/krabs-the-crab-quirk...   </p>\n<p>Low Poly Survival Game Props by Timothy Porter   </p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/low-poly-survival-game-props-107984   </p>\n<p>Low Poly Mini Village Free by Ioan Stan   </p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-mini-village-free...   </p>\r\nAudio \r\n<p>Nature Sounds FX by Lumionous https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/nature-sound-fx-180413   </p>\n<p>Low Poly Animated Animals by PolyPerfect https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/low-poly-animated-an...   </p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Oniku Loop\u00a02\u00a0by Anonymous:\u00a0https://www.dl-sounds.com/royalty-free/oniku-loop2/   </p>\r\nFont \r\n<p>Good People by The Docallisme \u2013 Amry Al Mursalaat   </p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/good-people.font\r\n  </p>\n<p>Campo De La Bota by Woodcutter\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/campo-de-la-bota.font\r\n  </p>\n<p>Cosmos Logic by Allouse Studio\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/cosmos-logic.font\r\n  </p>\r\nThumbnail Art \r\n<p>The ever talented TunaFishArt   </p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/tunafish_art/?hl=en   </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:33:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aab/aab5a92da38837ff856d10f8c6289325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CinemaLeo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
