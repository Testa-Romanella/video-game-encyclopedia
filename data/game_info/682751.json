Sounds simple doesn't it? Wrong! Because everyone else is also making changes to the maze, in order to collect their items!</p>\n<p>The maze is made up of a grid of tiles, with one tile off to the side.\u00a0Each turn you can shift a row or column of these tiles by slotting the extra tile in place. You are then able to move the player using the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Invite your friends (using Steam) and be the first to escape the maze with all your items. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:44:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25d229f9739de0043e22186a3ce88656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ali_Dee"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
