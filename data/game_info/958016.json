Who knows. Just make sure you get the parts that the computer tells you to, so you can keep flying. Luckily someone tripped and spilled all of their generic space parts everywhere.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Fly out from the ship and fly through the vast emptiness to bring back the parts towards the rocket. Connect them to your ship and drag them behind you until you make it back to the rocket. The proper pieces are few and far between, however, so you may have to search a little.<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>But be careful. If you're away from the ship for more than ten seconds at a time, you'll start running out of oxygen. You run out of oxygen, you die. That's not ideal for making it through space, I hear.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W, A, S, D - Movement<br/>E - Tether to Nearby Satellite<br/>R - Restart<br/>ESC - Exit to Menu (Or Exit Game)</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Meta Information:</p>\n<p>There is always exactly two of each item drifting through a 1024X1024 room.
