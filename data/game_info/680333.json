In this maze, the player acts as\u00a0Theseus, the king of Athens who is attempting to escape the\u00a0Labyrinth. The main difference between this and the standard type of labyrinth, beyond the fact that it is set on a\u00a0grid, is the fact that the maze is not empty, but also contains a\u00a0Minotaur\u00a0who hunts the player down, taking two steps for every one the player takes.\r\n</p>\n<p>While the Minotaur is faster than the player, his moves are predictable and often inefficient: they are determined by checking to see if he can get closer to the player by moving\u00a0horizontally, then checking to see if he can get any closer by moving vertically. If neither move would place him closer to the player, the Minotaur skips his turn. Theseus may also skip his turn.\r\n</p>\n<p>This type of maze was first published in 1990 in Robert Abbott's book\u00a0<em>Mad Mazes</em>. The idea was later published in the British magazine\u00a0<em>Games &amp; Puzzles</em>.</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus_and_the_Minotaur</p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p>I made this game as part of a programming test for a company.<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay and level designs are referenced from\u00a0https://estivalet.github.io/theseus-minotaur/<br/></p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p><strong>Date:\u00a0</strong>August, 2021</p>\n<p><strong>Duration:</strong>\u00a010 hours</p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0Move Theseus</p>\n<p>W\u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0Make Theseus wait and\u00a0skip a turn\u00a0</p>\n<p>U\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0Undo move<br/></p>\n<p>N\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0Next level<br/></p>\n<p>P\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0Previous level</p>\n<p>R\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0Restart current level\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T04:12:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/422/422e43641869dd33e73e5881e02665ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelFr0ggie"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
