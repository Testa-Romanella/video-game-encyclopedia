The player can walk around, sniff things, meow\u00a0and\u00a0eat\u00a0just\u00a0like\u00a0a real cat!\u00a0The\u00a0reason\u00a0I\u00a0picked\u00a0this as\u00a0the\u00a0basis\u00a0for\u00a0my\u00a0game\u00a0was\u00a0because\u00a0this\u00a0moment honestly\u00a0changed\u00a0my\u00a0life.\u00a0I\u00a0was\u00a0never\u00a0really\u00a0into\u00a0pets\u00a0before,\u00a0and\u00a0I\u00a0thought\u00a0the\u00a0idea\u00a0of\u00a0taking\u00a0care\u00a0of\u00a0animal\u00a0was\u00a0silly\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0waste\u00a0of\u00a0money. but\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0time\u00a0I\u00a0saw\u00a0this\u00a0little\u00a0cat walking around I just looked at it in awe. I fell in love with her as time went on and after begging my mom for about 4 to 5 months she finally relented and let me officially adopt her. Having her has really changed the way I look at responsibility and my friends tell me now I'm a cat lady in the making.</p>\n<p>This is the first 3D game I've done on my own in a while, so I was pretty nervous when I was working on it, but at the same time it was really exciting. \u00a0I started by mapping out the area, rendering the building in blender. I had a lot of fun modeling the cat in 3D as it's a lot more detail and shaping then a simple wall. I think one of my least favorite things was dealing with coding, \u00a0but really just the parts when things wouldn't work the way I initially believed they would. At the end of the day I'm really happy with what I did because I did it on my own for the most part.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/121fb84316bb2110f63d891c8bbe8f0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Raymond Lothian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
