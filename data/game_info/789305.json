Once tapped by forces\u00a0ancient and forgotten, all that remains are scant clues to magic unleashed by these forces in the past: ruins and hints of past civilisations scattered across untethered, floating \"skylands.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>...which is exactly where you and your classmates are headed on a field trip today. Between the bad dreams you've been having lately, a recent mysterious accident on campus and whispered hints of a growing cult, you're a bit on edge, but you're sure those rumbles in the sky are just a storm blowing over....</p>\n<p>Be transported to the magical world of Starsworn Academy, where the students are ecletic and the teacher is...murdered?! Solve the mystery through dialog and a hunt for clues before your ragtag group of students is slain, possessed or even worse...expelled.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Note: This game is an alpha release, with unfinished content and potential bugs blocking progression.
