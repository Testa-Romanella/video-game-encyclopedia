{"id": 862285, "slug": "tensec-fighter", "name": "TENSEC FIGHTER", "name_original": "TENSEC FIGHTER", "description": "<p><strong>BRIEF:</strong></p>\n<p>The experimental fighter craft <strong>AB-95X TENSEC</strong> has been deployed to combat the growing swarm of <strong>CESNET</strong> drones from the rebel Fibonacci faction. Its innovative one-touch control and unproven auto-fire mechanism may be difficult to tame, but a decorated ace pilot such as yourself is never the kind to back down from a challenge.<br/></p>\n<p>The craft is proven to interface well using the <strong>WASD keys</strong>, the <strong>left gamepad stick</strong>, or the dragging motion of a fleshy finger on a <strong>touchscreen</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Every move will engage the weapons system</strong>, which has yet to receive bespoke subzero cooling hardware. In the meantime, you\u2019ll have to keep watch of the heat gauge or you may be caught empty-handed as <strong>the weapons system cools down for ten seconds</strong>! TENSEC is also made of experimental alloys made to improve maneuverability at the cost of durability. <strong>Ten hits</strong> may be enough to send you six feet under!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The enemy front launches in ten-second waves</strong> with a surplus of slower last-generation craft. Points will be given for every ten seconds you survive and every craft you down.\r\n</p>\n<p>The future of our territory rests on you now. Good luck!\r\n</p>\n<p>=====\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSpace Fighter Loop\u201d Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under CC BY 4.0\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWire One\u201d \u00a9 Cyreal (cyreal.org)<br/>Licensed under SIL OFL 1.1\u00a0http://cyreal.org/license/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T12:53:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d43be50fbfb39ffeafd2706b8a117f7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["weetabix.su"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
