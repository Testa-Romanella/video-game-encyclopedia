This consumption has many adverse secondary effects to both personal and global health, a harsh reality that some would rather keep a secret. Would you rather live without or maintain the status quo, no matter the cost? The only thing that is clear is that what we are doing now is unsustainable.</p>\n<p>This project was created to test out a new art style and as a submission to the IndieCade2020 game jam.
