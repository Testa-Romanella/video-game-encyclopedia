You kick automatically by walking or dashing into the dice.

Originally I\u00a0wanted to make this into more of a multiplayer/vs. bots game, but that was a bit beyond my ability for this game jam. But hey this was my first, so I'm happy with what I\u00a0made, and I\u00a0may work on it some more since I have several ideas for it!\u00a0Hope you enjoy!\u00a0:)\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T10:03:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ae/2aedc4c61264caa7361672058311d94c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TaiyouShinobi"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
