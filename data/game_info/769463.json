German submarines with enhanced underwater speed, underwater endurance and torpedo loading capabilities have better lighting efficiency and a safer output environment. At this point, the complete lineup of wolves that the German Navy is proud of has officially debuted, and the fiery scene of wolves fighting will be particularly spectacular.<br/><br/>The following is an introduction to the basic information of D-series submarines. Captains who like to play submarines can do their homework in advance\uff1a<br/>U-IIA (D series 2-class submarine): On the day when the Anglo-German naval agreement was passed, the new German submarine U-1 was officially launched. The new submarine is called Type 2A (Tpye IIA), which is mainly used for submarine crews. train and test. Due to their small tonnage, these submarines seldom conduct far-sea operations.<br/><br/>U-VIIA (Class 3 submarine of D series): Type 7A is the basic prototype of Type 7 submarine. It is a new generation of medium-sized attack submarines built by the German Navy after World War I. This type of submarine was designed in 1933 and its main technology is based on World War I. The Type 3 submarine was improved. The performance of the Type 7 submarine is very good, and the diving speed is very good.<br/><br/>U-VIIC (D series 4-class submarine): The 7C type is the most productive type of the 7-type submarine, and it is also one of the main submarines of the German submarine force during World War II. This type of boat is slightly longer than the 7B type, but does not improve the performance of the main engine, so the speed is reduced.<br/><br/>U-VIIF (D class 5 submarine): As the threat of Allied aircraft to the submarine force was increasing, Germany thought of strengthening the submarine's air defense to counter the threat of air strikes. Some Type 7C submarines were converted into dedicated anti-aircraft submarines (U-Flak). These conversions added two to three quadruple 20mm anti-aircraft machine guns to the submarine, and experimentally added 37mm anti-aircraft guns. Anti-aircraft artillery, torpedo reserves were reduced.<br/><br/>U-IXA (D series 6-level submarine): The 9A submarine was designed as the basic type of the 9-type submarine in 1935. It refers to the Type 1 submarine developed after the First World War. Its combat goal is to focus on ocean-going operations. The fuel tank and the torpedo attack capability were strengthened.<br/><br/>U-IXC (D-Series 7th-class submarine): The 9C type adds an additional 43 tons of fuel tanks on the basis of its basic model, which further expands the sailing range. This series also removes the second periscope in the control room. In order to perform mine-laying tasks, the Type 9C also has additional mine chambers.<br/><br/>U-IXD-2 (Class 8 submarine of the D series): Type 9D is the largest model among Type 9 submarines. The entire Type 9D is divided into 3 types due to different power systems. Type 9D2 is mainly based on Type 9D1. Its unreliable powertrain has been corrected.<br/><br/>U-XXI (D series 9-class submarine): Type 21 is one of the new high-speed submarines developed by the German Navy during World War II. The boat was designed to increase the underwater speed as the main goal. Therefore, the shape and structure of the boat The design is very simple and streamlined, removing the useless deck guns, while increasing the battery capacity and improving the power system, giving it a strong underwater combat capability, the Type 21 has also become the prototype of modern submarines.<br/></li><li><strong>  Incorporating hundreds of classic tactics, and supporting the original tactic system. </strong><br/>Steel Ocean: Wolves of Deep Sea also restores hundreds of classic sea battle tactics and sea battle maps.
