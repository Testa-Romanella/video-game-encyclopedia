The aim is to complete the levels by using only a grapple hook. There are currently only 5 levels. The art is also temporary, using assets from here. On the lookout to commission some art so please get in touch if you are interested or know someone who might be :)</p>\n<p><strong>You can only grapple to metal surfaces. If you run out of grapples, hold R to restart.</strong></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Fire Grapple: <strong>Left Click</strong></li><li>Disconnect Grapple: <strong>Right Click</strong></li><li>Restart Level: <strong>Hold R</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Please leave any feedback if you can, it really helps and will steer the development significantly!
