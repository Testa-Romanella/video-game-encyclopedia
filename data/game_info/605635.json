{"id": 605635, "slug": "gaia-project", "name": "Gaia Project", "name_original": "Gaia Project", "description": "In <strong>Gaia Project</strong>, each player controls one of 14 factions striving to peacefully colonize the <strong>Terra Mystica</strong> galaxy. Each faction has different environmental needs to survive on a planet. These needs have led the factions to master terraforming, enabling them to make different planet types habitable for themselves. During the game, you will colonize new planets, upgrade mines into better structures, and unite planets to form federations. The choice is yours: will you expand near other factions, which might give you power and trade partners, or will you look for solitude, where you can expand more freely? In addition, you will need to research and discover new technologies to improve your skills. In the end, only the best developed faction will win.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T05:57:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e461cbb87819f466e8a30991debebeb4.jpg", "website": "https://digidiced.com/gaiaproject/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 35, "achievements_count": 47, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["DIGIDICED"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DIGIDICED", "Digidiced UG (haftungsbeschrankt) i.G."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
