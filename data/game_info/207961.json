The focus will eventually be the music. Once it's in the game... I plan on having it build up over time as the player gets further along. I also want to make the driving more interesting by having it sway back and forth slowly.<br/><br/>This prototype is to get the general tone and feel of the game. The music will really bring everything together.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["StyrofoamBoots"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
