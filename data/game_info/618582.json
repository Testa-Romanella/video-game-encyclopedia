You must also defend your base from waves of enemies with your turret defense system. These turrets must also be supplied with fuel, which is collected\u00a0from fallen enemies.\u00a0Keep your turrets refueled but don't spend too much time and fuel on the towers... The horde is growing!</p>\n\n<p>Joined Together:</p>\n<p>An enemy becomes a resource in this unique and resource-driven\u00a0tower defense game. Players rely on the barrage of invaders to refuel their turrets and supply power to their base. Players must literally join together with the remnants of their enemy, the turrets for refueling, and the home base to supply power.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c60/c606c917d1efa62551f23bc28267e313.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Friendly Warlocks"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
