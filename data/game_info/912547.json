Why should you be interested? Allow  us to set the story\u2026\r\n    </p>\n<p>During high school you washed cars as a side job. You worked very  hard and always made sure to put in the little extras. Since you were so  focused on making it perfect, you always end up completely soaked.  During summer, this is not a problem, but during winter it can be very,  very cold.     </p>\n<p>One day, you manage to remain dry for the entire day without doing  even a little bit less of a perfect job. You are so proud! But then the  school bully shows up to throw water balloons at you and you end up  soaked anyways\u2026 With a deep sigh you turn around and start to wash the  last car of the day when something catches your eye. The water balloons  that hit the car actually cleaned it!     </p>\n<p>You quickly finish the car and run home. There, you tell your parents  about your idea, washing cars with water balloons, what a fun way to do  it! But instead of joining you in the excitement, they start laughing  at you. That can\u2019t work! What a dumb idea! Only your grandfather seems  interested. He takes you to the side and tells you that he has a parking  lot that you can use to try your idea.     </p>\n<p>Can you prove your family wrong and make this new car wash a success?\r\n    </p>\n<p>Experience the feeling of a true entrepreneur in this  unique tower defense game. Hire employees and pay their salary, throw  water balloons, pay for advertisements and make sure your reputation  does not drop.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T14:06:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c5492ebfcff9b13305b4e038a043301.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Monkey Sleeve Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
