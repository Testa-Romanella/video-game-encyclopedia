updated offset target over time depending on player velocity to gradually change curve; used same formula in blueprint to update position of ceiling point lights to match emissive light bar mesh <br/></p>\n<p>- All audio procedurally generated at runtime by in-engine synthesizer (and playable on PC keyboard)<br/></p>\n<p>- 24 fps gameplay: this topic is contentious, but I'm a cinemaphile and love the 24fps cinematic \"look\" -- however most games feel very jerky and unresponsive at such a low framerate, so I designed motion and input from the ground up to look and feel smooth and natural at this more film-like framerate<br/></p>\r\n\r\ncontrols\r\naccelerate / brakearrow keys up/down<br/>gamepad right/left trigger buttons (R2/L2)<br/>gamepad D-pad up/down<br/>left mouse click or drag top/bottom half of viewport\r\nsteeringarrow keys left/right<br/>gamepad left thumbstick left/right<br/>gamepad D-pad left/right<br/>left mouse click or drag left/right half of viewport\r\nboostspace<br/>gamepad left bumper (L1)\r\ncamera orbitgamepad right thumbstick<br/>right mouse click or drag<br/>ctrl + left mouse click or drag\r\ncamera distanceinsert/delete\r\ncamera aperturehome/end\r\ncamera focal lengthpage up/page down\r\nletterboxF6\r\nfullscreenF11<br/>alt + enter\r\nperformance/quality+/-\r\nauto-performance0 (zero)\r\nspawn opponentbackspace<br/>gamepad A\r\nscreenshotF8\r\nhigh res screenshotF9\r\npauseenter<br/>gamepad start\r\nexitesc<br/>backspace<br/>gamepad back\r\n\r\n\r\n// synth note input\r\n    _____ _____       _____ _____ _____       _____\r\n   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n   |  c# |  d# |     |  f# |  g# |  a# |     |  c# |\r\n   |  W  |  E  |     |  T  |  Y  |  U  |     |  O  |\r\n __|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|__\r\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n|  c  |  d  |  e  |  f  |  g  |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |\r\n|  A  |  S  |  D  |  F  |  G  |  H  |  J  |  K  |  L  |\r\n|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|\r\noctave down/up:       Z/X", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T06:49:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/861c51c1c1bdcd1a80ea0765e0bf055c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["acatalept"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
