You control your character with arrows and A, D and W keys. Zombies are spawned every 1-5 seconds and to avoid them you have to jump over them using the W key. There is much more stuff to it but it would be better if you tested them in game. It will be better if you make it full screen. Update: You can now respawn with R key and not only the respawn button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T16:08:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea9/ea9df21a1a972716127576dfabac0d88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LiterallyNoOne1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
