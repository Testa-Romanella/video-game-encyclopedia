{"id": 194272, "slug": "robin-hood-simulator", "name": "Robin Hood Simulator", "name_original": "Robin Hood Simulator", "description": "<p>Hi all!</p>\n<p>This is my second upload in a series of a Game-A-Week projects I took under Bennett Foddy's Prototype Studio class at NYU. Many of them were about me trying to learn specifics of coding and experimenting designs that were too weird to continue development, while trying to make something funny with it. These projects were actually made two years ago, and it was part of my plan to take this long to go back to them, make them presentable and release them to the public here.<br/></p>\n<p>In Robin Hood Simulator, I took the challenge of making a game without creating any art, nor any code by myself. Everything was going to be downloaded from the internet. Ironically, this resulted in maybe my most pretty prototype?</p>\n<p>This also marked my first foray into funny games. In\u00a0Robin Hood Simulator, you don't control an archer, but the arrow itself.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I didn't do, nor I claim to own, any of the art in this game, nor the characters. They were all taken from the Unity store<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/259/2599f8384175e0388436c2a5bd244f98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mauriciojuliano"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
