{"id": 4882, "slug": "lara-croft-gol", "name": "Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light", "name_original": "Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light", "description": "<p>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an action adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics. The title serves as a spin-off to Tomb Raider series and is not connected to the series storyline whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Two thousand years ago there was a battle between the Guardian of Light and the Keeper of Darkness. The Keeper won using the Mirror of Smoke with which he summoned a horde of horrible monsters, but the Guardian survived the encounter and imprisoned the Keeper in his own mirror. Fast-forward to the present day. Lara Croft finds the legendary mirror, but she does not know what evil it contains. </p>\n<p>The game puts a strong emphasis on cooperative play, yet it is possible to complete the game alone. While the previous installments in the series featured an action third-person camera, Guardian of Light is using a fixed isometric camera. The players can choose to play either as the Guardian himself or as Lara Croft with each character having their own abilities.</p>\n<p>Puzzles differ when played alone or in co-op mode. This was done in order to make the players rely less on AI.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2010-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T22:12:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a92/a92272ea5cfc35b8ad6317fbd81ce0f6.jpg", "website": "http://www.Laracroftandtheguardianoflight.com", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 244, "owned": 4048, "beaten": 267, "toplay": 48, "dropped": 185, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 496, "suggestions_count": 538, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 499, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Square Enix", "Crystal Dynamics"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
