As my luck would have it, that couldn't be further from the truth...</em></p>When Octavian Drammus purchases a simple statue, his life is irrevocably changed. Strange events begin to occur and nightmarish dreams come to him, all depicting his lost love. Who is this strange apparition appearing before him? Has the man he loved come back to him? Or is it something far more sinister?<p><em>In Darkness, Dreaming </em>is a short Twine game about lost love. It plays anywhere from thirty to forty minutes long. There is some violence and also graphic depictions of sex between two men (which can be skipped). Comments? Questions?
