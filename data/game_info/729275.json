You only have a certain amount of time left to complete the job and you will be scored according to how fast you were. But watch out, if your boat rams into something, it will take damage and eventually sink. Then it's over. Your boat will also get stuck if it runs aground. You can use Tab to reset its position, but if you are doing a mission, it will fail.</p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T11:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb6/cb63bb934c98b74f1ebde424e076f6db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Marienkiffer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
