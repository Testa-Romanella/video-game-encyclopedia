I went with Porchlight, a take on Torchlight. Initially, I was going to make this sort of an action RPG type game like Torchlight, but the final playable version here is way stripped down. Elements that survived are a randomly generated world, and a pseudo-experience earning system and modifiable abilities/strengths. The game won the game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ed/7ed8023e06d013f49e9482d216c2786e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["andreimarks"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
