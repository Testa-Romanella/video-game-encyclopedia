Being Night Security in this place will turn into a nightmare for you that you may never forget.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You play as a character named Gary, who must go to Whispering Winds Cemetery for his first workday and guard it from 5 PM to 8 AM the next day.<br/><br/>Initially, everything seems calm, but shortly after, conditions change, and gradually, the cemetery becomes a hell for Gary. Through surveillance cameras, Gary notices strange things, initially thinking they're only visible in the camera feed. However, as he walks among the graves, he realizes he must endure the most terrifying night of his life!<br/><br/><br/><br/>In creating this game, we aimed to focus on a sense of responsibility and genuine fear, rather than designing vague and tedious puzzles in the gameplay. We used realistic graphics and 3D sound to enhance the fear-inducing experience for the player.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T08:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc8/bc8927630e8bb1bcc80a04f8c1051db8.jpeg", "website": "http://aslangamestudio.com/graveyard-shift/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 83, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aslan Game Studio", "PunBros Games", "Fistfang", "Galavalomka Games", "DarkPhobia Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Aslan Game Studio", "Tobias Barendt", "Fistfang", "Galavalomka Games", "DarkPhobia Games", "Teaserplay"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
