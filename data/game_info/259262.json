The obstacles speed up over time with your score growing. It's an endless, fun and addicting game.

Thanks for your support :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c9/9c935797ffd2a96429e9c96b41ddcc13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skillgamesstudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
