{"id": 547891, "slug": "mini-miner-sam-hinton", "name": "Mini Miner (Sam Hinton)", "name_original": "Mini Miner (Sam Hinton)", "description": "<p>Mini Miner is an indie platforming game in which the player can only see in a small radius around him - encapsulating the remainder of the screen in darkness. The combination of fun controls and an interesting art style overall make this game a fun and enjoyable experience.</p>\n<p>Min Miner features a currency system in which coins can be collected in game and spent on skins in the item shop. Skins range from colour changes such as an elf inspired miner to complete redesigns of the player making for interesting characters of ranging prices.</p>\n<p>The game difficulty scales depending on the level, meaning the first level is designed for all ages and abilities whilst the final levels are targeted for extreme platformers who can cope with the rage inducing surprises filled throughout these levels.</p>\n<p>As well as having unlockable playable levels, there are also challenges. Challenges require a new level of skill in which a certain amount of coins must be collected in a certain time period. Every time you die you loose time, making the challenge harder and harder. These challenges scale similar to the levels - the final challenges are irritatingly impossible.</p>\n<p>It is important to note there are a limited amount of levels and challenges currently. However, more are in development as we speak meaning expect updates soon for new content.</p>\n<p>The game is furnished with incredible music provided by Alex Hemmerich. He is a fantastic musician who composes original, chiptune-style music tracks using a DAW called LMMS. His SoundCloud can be found here:<br/>https://soundcloud.com/thepolarpower</p>\n<p>With brand new content added in the most recent update, expect bug fixes and content updates as regularly as they are required.
