But the comparison stops here. <br/><br/>This time, you are controlling a 360 degrees moving paddle which can't drop any balls<br/>thanks to gravitational attraction.<br/><br/>This improved control mechanism is essential to deal with moving 3D voxel targets. You'll be able to finely adjust balls' movement all along their course.<br/><br/>A mechanism confering the needed velocity to clean up levels as fast as you can, since speed is the key to a great score.<strong>MAKE HIGHSCORE GREAT AGAIN!</strong><br/><br/>Back to an era of time before XP, before items, before any artificial features...<br/>It's time to bring back the glory of the highscore.<br/><br/>Enter you name on a realtime worldwide score table. Hit the daily, weekly and everlasting highscore, and light up your spot on the map.<br/><br/>So you'll know how skilled you really are.<br/>So everybody will know who you are.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/186/186031bd9aa900d1b458ac7f8497416e.jpg", "website": "http://codrer.com/hpu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 428, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Codrer"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Codrer"], "esrb_rating": null}
