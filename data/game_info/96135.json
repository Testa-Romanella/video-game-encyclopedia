Closing other programs, browsers, etc, or simply restarting the game fixes this.</p>\n<p>I myself have made tests on a 6 yr old rig, and once in a while frame loss is experienced. Upon restarting the game the issue is fixed.</p>\n<p>Turning off Scalnlines (filter) in the options menu also helps.\r\n</p>\n<p>I assume most will not have this problem, as the minimum requirements for the game are rather low.
