The issue occurs when ground pounding into water. If this happens, pressing the \"Backspace\" key will respawn you at the room's default spawn point and fix the softlock issue</p><p>+ Notes [Please Read Before Playing] +</p>\n<p>- As a heads up, there is no save system as I didn't get around to it. As such, the game must be completed in one sitting (it's not too long though, so hopefully that's not a problem).</p>\n<p>- At the end of the jam, I found there was an issue with the resolution that I was building with for the UI in that my machine's resolution was really high. As such, the text was unreadable on another test machine when not in fullscreen. Please try fullscreen if the text runs off of the screen.</p>\n<p>- The room to the left of your start is the exit and if you travel through it, you might end the game. As there is no save, make sure that you are done with what you want to do before entering!</p>\n<p>- The coin counter appear to have a bug in it of some sort. I believe I only placed enough coins for 168 coins (copper are worth 1, silver 3, and gold 5), but on my last test run, I ended with 174, so I have updated the counter to read 168? as I did not have time to recount and check at this point in the jam.</p>\n<p>+ Controls (*Requires ability)\u00a0+</p>\n<p>Movement: WASD</p>\n<p>Jump: Space</p>\n<p>Fireball*: K</p>\n<p>Roar*: Hold J, press K</p>\n<p>High\u00a0 Jump*: Hold J, press Space</p>\n<p>Dash*: Shift</p>\n<p>Ground Pound*: J (while in air)</p>\n<p>Double Jump*: Space (while in air)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T10:52:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a9/3a97143a9791c283c8c82a68113e7a3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["The Great Gallus"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
