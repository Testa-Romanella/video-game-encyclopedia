Timeout si a very small puzzle game where you must find the way to exit the current room where you actually are.</p>\n<p>But watch out ! Because you have a limit of time per level which is 50 seconds for every room and a limit of five tries with the spacebars.</p>\n<p>The theme was \u201c Running out of space \u201c, so i searched for some hours and I finally found my three ideas.</p>\n<p>The first one was a close room where the camera keep zooming on the player and when the player couldn\u2019t see anything he dies. Second one was to make a game with puzzles. And the last one was suggested by a friend, who told me, \u201c What if the player won\u2019t be able to use the spacebar like he wants ? \u201c. Finally i thought of a way like the player won\u2019t be able to interact with objects more times than a certain amount of times.</p>\n<p>I admit that this game is really short and doesn\u2019t have a large aount of features but I made it in about I think 30-40H which is not really long compared to the others. And it\u2019s y first game so be indulgent and I didn\u2019t know Unity perfectly at this time.</p>\n<p>I know this is not an a valid excuse, but I tried my best and I think this was the best thing to do.</p>\n<p>So, well enjoy playing my game, and don\u2019t hesitate to give returns :D</p>\n<p>See ya !!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb5e039a42f312f52147feea82f6667.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zom'"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
