These techniques, once learned, will stay with you forever. They will help you enjoy a more <strong>peaceful and happier life.</strong><h3>Gamitate is designed to help you in 2 ways:</h3><br/>1) Teach you as many techniques as possible in an easy and FUN way. <br/>2) Provide you with a pleasant environment to practice various meditation and mindfulness techniques.\u00a0<br/><br/>The techniques taught in this game come from a variety of sources: personal experiences, books, articles, etc. Some of them will work better for you than others. We\u2019re all cut from a different cloth so it\u2019s perfectly normal.\u00a0<br/><br/>You don\u2019t need to \u201cmaster\u201d each and every meditation technique. Just go through them all and stick with the ones that work best in your specific case.\u00a0<h3>WARNING:</h3><br/>Meditation doesn\u2019t replace medication and therapy.\u00a0<br/>If you suffer from a mental illness visit a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. <strong>Don\u2019t stop taking your prescribed medication</strong> unless your doctor tells you to.\u00a0<br/><br/>It may be tempting to try to \u201ccure yourself\u201d through meditation but it\u2019s always a bad idea, especially if you suffer from a serious mental disorder.\u00a0<br/><br/>Please be aware that there are a handful of articles and studies\u00a0which say that for a small number of people meditation may be harmful.
