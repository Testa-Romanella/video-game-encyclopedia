The signaller working today isn't the sharpest spoon in the shed. The broken radio means that you can hear him - but he can't hear you. As a last resort, you'll\u00a0have to communicate through semaphore if you want to save the day.</p>\n<p>Using each prompt one time only, you must signal the correct message to warn the nuns of the impending doom, or risk a religious catastrophe.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Will the crash be avoided? Will the nuns dodge out of the way? Can the buffet car be saved?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Featuring over\u00a025 unique endings, a cohort of friendly nuns, and a great deal of flag waving.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>//</p>\n<p>This game was created for GJL Game Parade Summer 2021.
