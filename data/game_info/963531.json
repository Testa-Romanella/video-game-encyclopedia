Block Machine's programming model is unique: Blocks are both code and data, and all computation happens in parallel. Von Neumann would have loved this.<h3>15+ Different Block Types to Explore</h3><br/>How many different ways can you find to use the basic arrow blocks? Or maybe you fancy the charged battery blocks? Wrap your head around the different capabilities and use them to build the smallest and fastest Block Machine.<h3>25+ Challenging levels, ranging from HARD to REALLY HARD</h3><br/>Solve difficult programming puzzles in this Turing tarpit. Can you beat the global highscore in any of the three categories?<h3>A Sandbox mode to mess around to your heart's content</h3><br/>Build that 1000 block machine your dreamt about last night. Or don't.
