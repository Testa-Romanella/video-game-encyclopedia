Let's fix that.</p>\n\n<p>We Are Here for You is a short idle game all about making friends. You play the role of a lonely outcast, surrounded by darkness. Your goal is to fill that empty void, both inside and around you, with friends! But how could a pathetic loner like you find anyone to talk to, let alone become your friend?</p>\n<p>This game is about exploring yourself and trying out new things, and seeing how the world around you expands as you meet new people and enjoy new experiences.\u00a0 Gameplay is fairly straight-forward: You balance personal happiness with work to earn money, and take up various interests where you may find new friends. You can spend money to buy items that will help you on your journey. There are a total of 24 unique friends to find, and they are hiding behind every corner: You might be able to befriend the local baker by working at his store, or the sheepish bookworm by visiting the library. Friends you meet can introduce you to new hobbies or job opportunities, where you may come across even more friends, and so on. Everything is related to everything, so the best way to play is to try things out, and be patient!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is my first game ever, and it was made in Python using the Pyglet library. All feedback is welcome, and I hope you have fun ;)</p>\n\n<p>Ps. Windows might get cranky about running unknown .exe files. I don't know if there's any way to fix that, or if there's better ways of compiling the game from code. I tried to get my friends to test the game out, but nobody turned up. The game is finished, but all feedback is very much welcome :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T09:10:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0f/d0fe3b6d5ef73763d06f5013916de71f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["luuseri0111"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
