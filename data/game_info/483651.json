She lives using the bountiful resources in the area with little to no interaction from the closest towns and villages. Seems like her experience as a shaman is starting to fade away and is used less and less for each passing day\u2026 And she is happy to let her old magics rest. <br/></p>\n<p>Her keen senses (and a fair bit of intuition) warned her of something wicked that may change her peaceful life\u2026 But nothing happened for a time. Ill tidings seem to be coming, dark clouds in the horizon weren\u2019t ever a good omen. Her unrest and unease was palpable but eventually was thrown on the back of her mind... Until a couple of strangers with weird malaises appeared between the trees at the edge of the grove. <br/></p>\n<p>She was kind enough to talk with them, but she wanted nothing more than to be kept at bay, out of harms way. Their insistence asking for help was too much and unwillingly opened her dusty old tome to look for a cure for this couple of strangers. After a while, she found a formula that could aid them with that pair of extra appendages and all those feathers. She found those curses amusing as they weren\u2019t really hurting them, merely annoyances for their everyday.</p>\n<p>She begged them to not say a word of her skills, as she wanted to keep her privacy and calm. They misheard her (maybe another hex?) and spread her deeds in the village like wildfire\u2026 And soon she had a small queue of people with really strange curses on them. <em>Shining</em> villagers? Kids touching things sending them to sometime in the <em>future</em> or <em>past</em>? Old townsfolk <em>talking backwards</em>? <br/></p>\n<p>With an odd look, and cursing the deafness of the first couple of visitors, she reluctantly took her cauldron to the middle of her hut, prepared her runes and reagents and set up shop to get rid of this unpleasant visitors. <br/></p>\n<p>What was happening to their land?\u00a0 Who or what was cursing, hexing and jinxing everyone around?</p>\r\nSetting\r\n<p>You\u2019re a shaman in the forest of <strong>Doovoo</strong> in <em>Obviousland</em>. Used to a peaceful life and keeping your old healing ways out sight, nothing annoyed your secluded grove for centuries. But things are always bound to change and those dark clouds marked a shift in the winds. <br/></p>\n<p>Villagers from <strong>Viclose</strong> and townsfolk from <strong>Tonfar</strong> began visiting (more like swarming) your hut, asking for cures. No one knows where this curses come from, but they are certain they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. <br/>With no clear foe and with so many affected in need of aid, what can an old shaman witch do other than try to help? An infinite queue of surreal ails may keep us busy for a while, with no end in sight\u2026 <br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p><strong>X\u2019inj</strong> life as a shaman isn\u2019t easy, with all those villagers swarming her hut for aid, but yours as a player is simple enough. You just have to be quick and accurate in creating formulas with your pointer. <br/>Don\u2019t keep your villagers waiting for long or else they will leave (be it afraid, bored or angry) while hurting your reputation! <br/></p>\n<p>*<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: No villager was hurt during the creation of this videogame.
