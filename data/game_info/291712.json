Be careful what you shoot, but I can also tell you, that there are few secrets hidden.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>All you need is just your mouse. Left click to SHOOT, right click to RELOAD your gun.\u00a0You can also shoot using the SPACE button and RELOAD with Shift button.</p>\n\n<p>Each kill will get you some score points. How much you can get and can you beat others? Share your results.</p>\n\n<p>As this is my first game that I've been doing from scratch on my own, I would appreciate any feedback or CC.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for Your time</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f3/9f31bccf41a61c9b3c5abf1b871c2409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jin9310"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
