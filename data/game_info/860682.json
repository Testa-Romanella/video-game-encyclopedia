In saying that the UI elements are also very limited there is no pause button however once the 3 minute timer ends you will be able to either replay or quit the game with no troubles.</p>\n<p>There is also currently no sound in the game what so ever, its very barebones at the moment, but I do hope you like the concept as I tried to build the correct atmosphere for it, thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T18:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/667f4da5eb8b6896ed4990b7549794c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
