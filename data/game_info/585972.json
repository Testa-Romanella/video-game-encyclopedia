You play as a skull exploring a ruined city in search of your body.\u00a0 You can also explore and find optional collectables, if you want.</p>\n<p>The game was created in Unity over the course of a few months. Since it's my first game and i wanted to finish the project relatively quickly, it's not exactly the most polished experience. Hopefully you can still enjoy it for what it is, though. I hope you have fun playing it, and stay tuned for some far more polished (and interesting) games from me in the future :)</p>\n<p>(Also, if there's enough interest, i may make a patch tweaking and polishing the game further, adding more QoL stuff, ect.)</p>\n<p>Everything was done by me except for some sound effects. Some were done by my friend\u00a0David MM Ramos, some are from freesound.org, which i'll link here:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/JustInvoke/sounds/446115/<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/JustInvoke/sounds/446100/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/JustInvoke/sounds/446098/</p>\n<p>The rest were done by me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T11:43:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/8614a1a3d85f425bfa4ed5f80596fbdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ecto"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
