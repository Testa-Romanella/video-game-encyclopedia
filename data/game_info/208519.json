I made this to expand on some basic random generation that Tom Francis teaches in his youtube video series teaching people how to make their first game with no experience.<br/></p><p>If you get stuck there is a gun to shoot the blocks away and ammo to refill it. You cant finish every level, but most will be completable. If you need to restart just hit R it should generate a new level every time. </p><p>(made a small change added a start screen which forces you to click in the screen, previous version needed a click to enable control but that cost a bullet so added the ugly blue start screen to get around this!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e11/e1122be4057ef549f5b2b95fa70603c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Will Richards"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
