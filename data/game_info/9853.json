Up to 150 players can compete at once, and the last survivor wins. There is also a team deathmatch option for groups of two to five.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each match, all players are dropped randomly across the map. Before they start killing each other, they have to find themselves weapons, armor, and other necessary supplies. They may even use cars and bikes found in the game area to move faster or run down their opponents. Crafting is also available, and players can use items they gathered to make improvised armor and weapons. </p>\n<p>Some players may decide to stay out of the fight for as long as possible to let their opponents eliminate each other. They can not bide their time forever, though: to prevent players from camping for too long, the game area will shrink over time. Poisoned gas will eventually cover larger and larger sections of the map, forcing the players to come together at last and indulge in the good old ultraviolence. The masks and hilarious motley outfits worn by the characters not only make them look unique but also bring into H1Z1 a distinct flavor of The Purge film series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:08:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/848/848253347dc93c762bfd51c7e4989b8f.jpg", "website": "https://www.h1z1.com/king-of-the-kill", "rating": 2.36, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 92, "owned": 3455, "beaten": 30, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 232, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 340, "suggestions_count": 543, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 343, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daybreak Games Company"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Daybreak Game Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
