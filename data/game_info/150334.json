Please try it until the \"end\" and tell me what you thought of it. Just a note: eat worm to stay alive. Use the mouse to move, no secrets. I'm still finishing the game and I'll upload the last version of it as soon as it's ready, wich may be until weekend. Congrats to all who finished (or not) their games. I'm hoping to have more time to work on the next LD. Thank you all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pudimnicolas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
