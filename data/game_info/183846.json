To escape from the rest of the school day, and the dreadful event that happens afterwards, you must secure a doctor's note from the nurse's office on the other side of the school, and then\u00a0bring it to the unbuttoned teacher around the entrance(the cube behind him).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Avoiding the stares of your classmates is only half the battle, sometimes to proceed onward,\u00a0you must shoot your pheromones directly into their eye holes. This repulses some, causing them to flee in a flash, while others are unfazed by your pheromones. If you happen to wander in front of ones gaze ever so carelessly, the anxiety will eat at you, memories of you, playing through your head, that one time you shat in the ocean and you didn't know poo floated so everyone knew you pooped in the ocean, that other time where you were caught kissing your hand in the bathroom while holding a picture of the yellow power ranger. Memories like those\u00a0playing over and over again until you pass out, only to later wake up in your classroom. It would seem someone doesn't want you to leave early, hmmmmmmmmm?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c064968f8304167df1539cccaefca35e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blindman_RvsB"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
