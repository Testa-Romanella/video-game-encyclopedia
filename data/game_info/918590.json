Unfortunately, Holmes has the flu, so it is up to Watson to do the legwork for this particular mystery.</p>\n<p>Use arrow keys to move and advance dialogue; swipe in corresponding directions on mobile.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for Bitsy Jam #69: Public Domain using bitsy and borksy.<br/></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>This game is based on real life events. Not the Sherlock Holmes part, which is based on the fictional character Sherlock Holmes now in the public domain, but the events where someone is very sick and a friend steps in and helps them. <br/></p>\n<p>See, I (Rascal) have been fixated on Sherlock Holmes since I was a kid. One of my favorite things in the world. And then it came up in a bitsy jam?\u00a0<em>And</em> it's #69??? The stars had aligned, it was meant to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem: I had covid. And I'm one of those lucky people with the Additional Complications that show up when I get covid. So on three different types of medication and mandatory bed rest, I was not going to be able to make a game for this. Which led me to tell my tale of woe to James (StoneSable), who said, wanna team up? And so we did. I was only able to do things that I could do in my sleep; fortunately writing Sherlock Holmes fanfiction is one of those things. James did literally everything else and absolutely killed it. And by our powers combined in a little over 24 hours we had a game. That's the power of friendship.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T11:21:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c18/c18fe9501b0f5553a1520a4608675e8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rascal", "StoneSable"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
