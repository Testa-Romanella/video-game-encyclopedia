I was inspired by one of the mechanics from Ori and The Blind forest. Unfortunately a good majority of the time I was hoping to put into polishing the assets and adding more hazards got consumed fixing some essential bugs :(<br/><br/>That being said, I\u00a0hope you can at least enjoy the first stage!\u00a0The second stage is more for just playing around with the mechanics available.<br/><br/>You can use T to swap between movement modes (Swipe / Sling, basically) and you can press R to respawn! I use NVIDIA's Blast so you should have lots of fun spamming that R key.<br/><br/>All assets were made by me, including the code / art.<br/><br/>Thank you for checking it out!\u00a0I put a lot of hours into it!<br/><br/>Update: I had to upload a second ZIP because I uploaded my save data with the first one and that would cause the story to not play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57b/57b2804f02a299efe752246a9ee75e88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skullfurious"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
