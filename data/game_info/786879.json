The player has to navigate through the debris of the environment and solve puzzles by manipulating the ancient machinery around, as well as using technological parts to either upgrade themselves or interact with the environment in various ways. As the player reaches the top floor of the factory they've been exploring, they finally see the true wreckage of the city, and the game ends with a powerful earthquake hitting the building.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T13:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/feb/feb8ff746b299352e37ff8dda070ba47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wantcha"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
