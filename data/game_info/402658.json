Well that's up to you\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of Slime Guide\u00a0is to guide 10 waves of slimes to heaven. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>However, some slimes are evil, they must be stopped.  Detect the evil slimes with your torch and shoot them before they can infiltrate slime heaven.\u00a0 Don't let any slimes hit you though.\u00a0\u00a0Of course you could kill the good slimes too... but being evil has consequences... </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Move around with WASD<br/>Click to shoot<br/>Hold right click to turn on a torch that detects evil slimes (you can also press spacebar to do this)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Made in 3 hours for the Trijam! (only just...) and making\u00a0time-lapses is\u00a0fun so I've done\u00a0another - see the video! \u00a0</p>\n<p>I think I tried to add a bit too much and this ended up way too ambitious for 3 hours so the evil boss mode didn't get finished and this probably has all sorts of bugs but in the spirit of the three hour time limit I'll leave this as it is until after the jam and then do a hotfix.\u00a0\u00a0But it was a cool\u00a0opportunity to have a bit of fun with my new graphics monitor, I've not tried hand drawing sprites like this before</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Music used : Shmup Music Pack by ZStriefel<br/>Font Used:\u00a0Wet Paint</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6f/c6ffb4d70b122b93d48231de8d72e1dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KatieLG"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
