Nobody believes in your strength. You decide to prove everyone wrong and travel to the infamous Haunted Dungeon, where the dead are alive. Big treasures are told to lay there. Will you be able to retrieve them?</p>\n<p>Done in 7 days for the Blackthornprod GAME JAM #3! This is my second completed project and it's immensely more complex than my previous one.</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam was \"less is more\": I incorporated the theme by making a puzzle dungeon crawler where for every attack you do, you get less damage for your next attack.\u00a0All assets (art, scripts, music, sound effects) created by me.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD or arrow keys to move/attack\u00a0</p>\n<p>Estimated playthrough time: 5-10 minutes.</p>\n<p>An immense thank you goes to Jun for helping me in the programming phase and for making me learn a lot of new things (btw check his game that was featured on Newgrounds, it's insanely good:\u00a0MAD SISTERS' WEEK OFF!!!
