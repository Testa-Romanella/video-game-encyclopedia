Yay! its late, I know, I had to reset the due date. But thats because of my hay baling season coming in, and i didn't get to put in nearly as much work as I wanted. Hope there are no major issues!</p>\n<p>My Changes:</p>\n<p>Made a (kinda) new gun for level 2</p>\n<p>Added a few models from blender, no time for any fancy things, just a few 30 second things</p>\n<p>Level 3 has a floor that kills you.</p>\n<p>Ummmmmmmm . . . Level 4 has a door that needs two keys, but i think that doesn't count because I just copy/pasted the door with the same location and rotation values.</p>\n<p>I added a variable into the player controller so now I can let the player have any number of \"double\" jumps as I want. . . but I didn't use it.</p>\n<p>I only have them in level one, but i have destructible cacti! shoot them, and they break, along with any segments above it.</p>\n<p>I added a slightly glitchy enemy in level 2 with a key embedded in its back that gives you the key if you kill it.</p>\n<p>I upgraded the boss to shoot blue, more powerful bullets now that deal 2 damage per hit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T12:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8c/d8cbead2f522bce0737959b3d9cb03e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bluestone33105"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
