Just grab an eraser and throw to opponent girl!<br/>Meet the cute toon-shaded girls which you have not seen ever in VR.<br/><br/>There's an IK system in which the character moves as you can move.<br/>Also we placed a mirror in the room and you can see your character yourself.<br/>In the playroom you can meet your character at a very close distance. You can also experience hands-on dancing with your character. I think that it is a special experience that can be experienced only in VR.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcf100e7a4713ceec3628e70ed95e2be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reality Reflection"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Reality Reflection"], "esrb_rating": null}
