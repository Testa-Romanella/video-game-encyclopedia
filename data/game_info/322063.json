Find a pair of adjacent monsters like that on the board, and tap them to remove them from play.</p>\n<p>Clearing an entire row will allow more monsters to fall in from the top, and you get a nice score bonus. However, if the slot machine ever produces a pair of monsters that can\u2019t be cleared from the board, it\u2019s game over. The longer you can last, the higher your score is.</p>\n<p>But wait, there\u2019s more!</p>\n<p>As you reach a certain threshold of points in a game, you\u2019ll unlock a monster pack. Currently, there are 15 monster packs which comprise a grand total of 45 cute and cuddly Da Monsters!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T08:02:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aaf7a1e6a2c63e28c194ae771ce8b63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spacehunter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
