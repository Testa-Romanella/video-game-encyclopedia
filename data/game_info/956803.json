This can be challenging since product labels often list sodium content in milligrams per 100 grams, and people may not know how to convert that to the amount of sodium in a specific serving size.</strong></p>\n<p>this version is NOT for mobile.</p>\n<p> users can input the weight of the product, the sodium content per 100 grams, and the serving size. The calculator would then display the total amount of sodium in the product, as well as the amount of sodium per serving.\r\n</p>\n<p>plus how many spoons of sodium the product hides inside.</p>\n<p>Again this is just for fun! nothing more!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T16:18:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f4/7f41e4d506cc39fb90c49b15aae7b728.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yodda"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
