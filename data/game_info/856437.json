My role was editor and assembler.</p>\n<p>This project was developed for the 106 Adventure Game Challenge. The theme of the jam was \"Stranger in a Strange Land,\" and the goal was to create a story where the protagonist is \"in a place with a culture they are completely unfamiliar with, and the issues they face are a result of that unfamiliarity.\"</p>\n<p>The things the Ais came up\u00a0with were often\u00a0<strong>strange, beautiful, and downright spooky</strong>. I definitely got the feeling I was\u00a0stepping into\u00a0an alien culture.</p>Instructions\r\n<p>Left click with your mouse to do everything.
