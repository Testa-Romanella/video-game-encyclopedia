During your visit, Grandma accidentally swallows a fly. Believing she will die from the fly, she sends you out to find animals she can swallow to catch the fly. Her attempts continue to fail so in her desperation she tasks you to find ever larger animals to catch the previous animal she swallowed.</p>\n<p>This is a narrative-driven game inspired by the story and song of the old lady who swallowed a fly. Unlike the stories, there are two possible endings to the game. Will you find the animals she needs and save her life or will your dear sweet grandma be struck down by a common housefly?\r\n  </p>\n<p>Game play is about 15 minutes long. All of the events can be interacted with and have something to say about your current progress in the game. Multiple custom sound effects bring the story to life. All of the background music is custom. The graphics are a blend of stock and custom assets.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The rules of the One Map Game Challenge are the game takes place on one (1) map and has no more than 10 events, 10 variables, and 10 switches. Plugins are allowed as long as they do not circumvent any of the rules. The intent of the challenge is to inspire game makers to create and, more importantly, finish a game. For experienced game makers, the restrictions provide a creative challenge to do more with less.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b00/b00697a964d8531b4323339e2e0fa9bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neuralsplyce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
