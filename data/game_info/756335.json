{"id": 756335, "slug": "phantoms-revenge", "name": "PHANTOM'S REVENGE", "name_original": "PHANTOM'S REVENGE", "description": "A Game by Ben Saint\r\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Take on the role of Phantom Horn, a katana-wielding slime-infused socialist pony gangster with a bone to pick.\u00a0Battle\u00a0your way through mad science pony and war criminal\u00a0Night Star's secret lab using the power of SLIME! (The many uses of which are so obvious I won't insult your intelligence by enumerating them here.)</p>\n<p>Play fetch with your radioactive\u00a0pet horse, trade stocks and crypto\u00a0on your gellphone, marry your sword, and dab on the corpses of more than 50 unique enemies as you carve a bloody path toward vengeance.</p>\n<p>You'll need to manage your resources carefully to survive the gauntlet. A single slip up could cost Phantom his life, or worse. How much are you willing to sacrifice for the sake\u00a0of... REVENGE?</p>\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY SO FAR:\r\n<p>Phantom Horn was once a simple pony, living off YouTube ad revenue from his marginally successful My Little Pony review channel, TBBBAP. Until the day Night Star, the strange mare from the outskirts of Ponyville, banished him to New Los Angeles City a.k.a. Neo Milwaukee, a city of slime, hypercapitalism, and never-ending\u00a0gang violence.</p>\n<p>Phantom made a new life for himself in Slime City, until Night Star interfered once again, helping\u00a0to bring a storm of\u00a0Bicarbonate Soda Rain to clean away NLACakaNM's slime, with genocidal results. Now, with NLACakaNM and CWCville\u00a0at open war, Phantom has resolved to take on his own personal mission - to return to Equestria, find Night Star, and make her answer for her crimes.</p>\n\n\r\nYO, WHAT THE FUCK?\r\n<p>PHANTOM'S REVENGE is the finale of SLIME &amp; PUNISHMENT, a comic by me. It's set in the world of ENDLESS WAR, a text-based MMORPG played in a discord server, which I'm also partially responsible for making. You don't have to have played ENDLESS WAR to play PHANTOM'S REVENGE, but it doesn't hurt, since this game's mechanics are based on that one's. You don't necessarily have to have read SLIME &amp; PUNISHMENT either, but it's recommended to understand the story.</p>\n<p>This game and the comic it's part of are also canon to famous bad webcomic SONICHU, with the actions\u00a0of characters from that series having been largely dictated to me by its author. Now that she's in jail and busy writing letters about being the reincarnation of Jesus, that makes this technically the canon ending of that series. Neat!</p>\n<p>The true ending of SLIME &amp; PUNISHMENT is hidden. You must beat PHANTOM'S REVENGE to find the link. Good luck! It won't be easy.\u00a0And if you cheat and find it some other way, you're not allowed to tell me you did that! Wallow in your shame!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T11:15:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbf/dbfecf060301cea66d470f38ec54c36a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Saint"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
