There are two slimes, who are joined together by an invisible bond, and they are both hungry. This is my second unity game, and my first game uploaded anywhere. All images and sounds are made by me and the music was made using Google MusicLab (https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker). Feedback is appreciated, although I am aware of its many faults (Like occational visual artifacts, and the characters sometimes fall through the floor (press r to restart the level)\u00a0) .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c7899397287fcb0e9ebb956bbc81c27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Flune"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
