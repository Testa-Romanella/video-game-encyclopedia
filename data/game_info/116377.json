They're useful to understanding why the game plays as it does and what meaning we were going for in the ending we chose.

Sprites roamed freely, following the wake of the tranquille dragons.The dragons fed off flowers and the sprites grew in the dragon's energy. The shadows floated like ethereal mists of fluff, feeding off the sun's rays. Then, the volcanoes burst. Ash filled the skies, shutting off the sun, as all life fled to the caves. The sprites' light kept up hope, guiding the way for the dragons to continue feeding. The shadows turned to that only light, too...</p>\n<p> The sprites' light grew as it progressed. As the light grew, the dragon ventured further and further away, while more and more shadows grew attracted. It was free to roam as it wished, and in its lust for freedom, it distanced itself from the light which enabled it to fly.</p>\n<p>///Something happens///<br/></p>\n<p> (This is the end of the game, by the way)\"</p>\n\n<p>Our team members : R\u00e9mi (aka the hobo), Olivier (aka menu dealer), Corentin (aka trapped by boolean), Jonathan (aka break taker), Florent (aka blind coding), Alexys (aka mouseless computer) , Leo (aka the forgotten) and L\u00e9a (aka the princess).</p>\n<p>Special thanks to many extras (Zadig, BNEI, Adrien, TVn7, Musik7)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d99/d996feda4ff6384b7ca6253bb713019b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7fault Dev Team"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
