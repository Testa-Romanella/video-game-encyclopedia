Stay Home simulates a small piece of a city with 40,000 inhabitants and a population density similar to a reasonably dense city. During the \"game\" you can adjust the degree to which the city is locked down and the extent to which the inhabitants wear masks. You will be able to see the effects of this on the spread of the illness as well as the number of fatalities. <br/>How To Play:</p>\n<p>* You have to keep people alive for 15 \"days\".<br/>* You can adjust the fraction of people staying indoors and wearing masks.<br/>* The statistics about healthy / sick / recovered people are shown in a plot that appears across the map.<br/>* The number of people in different apartments in a building are shown with colored squares. The color indicates whether the inhabitants are sick, recovered, or healthy.</p>\n<p>Gifs:</p><p>First<br/></p>\r\nSecond<p>Screenshots:<br/></p>\n<p>Patch Notes:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T05:56:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25f/25f02696dacf1b839e96a8fab4e75872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["schsam"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
