There are 5 endings,  each playthrough lasts a few minutes at minimum. Playtest among friends  took 15 minutes on average to beat it on their first attempt.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you are having trouble  with the webGL version, please use the windows executable instead. FPS  games and webGL are a bit iffy. When running the executable, there is no  way to quit the game except for alt+f4 for now \r\n</p>\n<p>Want to skip the minute-long intro on repeat playthroughs?
