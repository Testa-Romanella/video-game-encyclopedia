{"id": 157796, "slug": "week8-test", "name": "WEEK8: TEST", "name_original": "WEEK8: TEST", "description": "<p>This week I really wanted to crack having systems that interact with each other. I found this great presentation by Randy Smith and Harvey Smith and decided to copy the example they gave and use it as a small test project. </p><p>Even though it is very simple it's amazing the effect just having a few interacting systems can have. It makes everything feel so much more alive.</p><p>Once I got that example up and running I set about altering it and working on my own version. I ended up doing a lot more planning up front, which really helped. It's surprisingly difficult to come up with a simple, but still sufficiently complex system. I found a very useful exercise was to break everything down into Nouns (game objects) and Verbs (actions). I have uploaded a screen shot of the document I used for planning.</p><p>This week I have also been thinking about they games I really enjoy and what they have in common. It's one of the main reasons I wanted to really focus on games interacting systems this week. I'm going to write an article that goes into more detail later on but for now, the games I like tend to feature:</p><ul><li>A Player Toolkit With a Variety of Functions (not just murder)</li><li>Short Session Based </li><li>High Vulnerability to Enemies</li><li>Highly Hostile Environment</li><li>No Upgrades Between Sessions</li><li>Single Mistakes Often Mean Failure</li><li>High Quantity of Interacting Systems</li></ul><p>Overall it was a really useful exercise as I would implement a change or additional actor and have no idea how it was going to pan out. Even though the scene was set up the same way by altering my actions as a player there was a different chain reaction, which was really exciting and made me think i might be headed in the right direction.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52d2f47d9e5cd021eb6147ebe1b1d86a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HK UdP"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
