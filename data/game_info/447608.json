{"id": 447608, "slug": "project-torn", "name": "Project Torn", "name_original": "Project Torn", "description": "<p>Project Torn is a choice based text adventure set in the distant future. Magic has been outlawed by the government and security forces have been installed to monitor citizens. Marcus has lived carefully to avoid the watchful gaze of those who intend to persecute him. However, while walking home one night, he is faced with a dilemma that will change the course of his life forever. Will he accept his destiny or continue his mundane life of safety and fear?</p>\n<p>This is chapter one in a, hopefully, five or so chapter series. Each chapter will build on the previous ones.\u00a0 Seeing as this one took me six months to create, the rest are probably going to be a little similar, if not shorter. I hope you enjoy it! And please, if you have any feedback, I will read the comments to update as needed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T05:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/167cc32bd17207762bbd2eba9c323a78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Drecksel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
