The game uses the concepts of opening chakras- energy vortices that run along the human spine. Through the journey of opening the chakras, you must maintain balance in them by collecting the moon and the sun to represent the ideal energy flow. Kundalini is a term that originated in ancient India. It refers to the energy that is coiled at the base of the spine, which starts at the first chakra, the root chakra. All game objects were handpainted with watercolor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d2/7d289d5c235adc32d93138727da6d3dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["evitalobo"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
