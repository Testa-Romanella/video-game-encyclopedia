{"id": 960943, "slug": "poor-lucas-and-the-evil-duke", "name": "Poor Lucas and the Evil Duke", "name_original": "Poor Lucas and the Evil Duke", "description": "Poor Lucas and the Evil Duke is a Metroidvania with action and RPG elements. Jump, slide, wall jump, swim, and battle your way through the Dukedom. Other mechanics include pushing boxes, pulling levers, and swinging on ropes. Enemies drop essences that will eventually unlock stat boosts or spells. Items in the game may be dropped as magic or can be enchanted.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe demo is of the first area of the game. The game is still in development so there still may be some changes by the time the game is completed. I did a good deal of polishing of this area, but could still use some fresh shine before the game releases.  I am open to suggestions to improve the quality of the game. Graphics are not my top priority, but gameplay is. I hope you have fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVersion 1.0 Update Notes 05/13/2023<br/>\r\n-Updated Graphics<br/>\r\n-Updated Music<br/>\r\n-Fixed Bugs<br/>\r\n-Full Game Launch!!!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVersion .11 Update Notes (Demo only)  02/21/2023<br/>\r\n-Balance adjustments<br/>\r\n-Fixed several bugs<br/>\r\n-Updated graphics<br/>\r\n-Added support for steam achievements<br/>\r\n-Added shiny enemies<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVersion .10 Update Notes (Demo only)  01/09/2023<br/>\r\n-Balance adjustments<br/>\r\n-Added ability to sort enemies<br/>\r\n-Fixed several bugs<br/>\r\n-Updated graphics<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVersion .09 Update Notes (Demo only)  12/17/2022<br/>\r\n-Fixed several bugs<br/>\r\n-Overall balance adjustments<br/>\r\n-Gameplay and quality of life improvements<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVersion .08 Update Notes (Demo only) 11/1/2022<br/>\r\n-Game is converted to pixel art<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVersion .07 Update Notes (Demo only) 8/29/2021<br/>\r\n-Fixed a couple of bugs<br/>\r\n-Added new enemies<br/>\r\n-Adjusted enemy essence rewards<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVersion .06 Update Notes (Demo only) 8/8/2021<br/>\r\n-Fixed a couple of bugs<br/>\r\n-Rebalanced item enchantments and potions<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVersion .05 Update Notes (Demo only) 8/5/2021<br/>\r\n-Giant overhaul.
