If you want to check out my other projects, go to\u00a0<strong>https://securas.itch.io/</strong>\u00a0or check out my twitter feed\u00a0<strong>@Securas2010</strong>.\u00a0Every now and then, I'll drop some stuff on my <strong>Youtube Channel</strong>. But that's unfortunately not very frequent.</p>\n<p>Some of the base mechanics of this game are based on one of my all time favorite games:\u00a0<strong>Rick Dangerous</strong>. Of course, I've <strong>modified</strong> them to enhance the <strong>action</strong> component rather than the puzzle component, as was the case of the original. I hope that you enjoy it and\u00a0<strong>PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT BELOW</strong>. It really helps me improve the game and perhaps learn new things.</p>\n<p>The game was built using the shiny brand new\u00a0 Godot Engine and\u00a0I would like to acknowledge the constant support of the Godot community.</p>\n<p><strong>https://www.facebook.com/groups/godotengine/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ab/5abd3e0b0c256af5fb7b73f0cefbc7b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["securas"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
