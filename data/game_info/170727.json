Welcome to No Man's Asteroids.<br/></p><p>This is a fun little Asteroids-style game, soon to have way more features and feel a lot more like a finished 'game'. However, in it's current state, it has an endgame goal, an ending, and some really fun dogfights. I hope to update again soon, with more features, ships, and sound.</p><p>Like the game, and want to support me? Buy the source code, only $0.25 . If you'd rather not pay that, all of the code and assets are still available at Github. Thanks for playing!<br/></p><p>-Enemby</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df0/df03cf962c90258853018feb768a34a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Enemby"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
