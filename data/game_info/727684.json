Mario, our Resuscitator Crow, come to the studio super excited with the idea of participating in a GameJam. He wanted that for once the whole studio worked together on the same project. That idea excited the rest of the crows, so I couldn't say no. I thought that was a great idea to work together for once and see how we work as a team. We spend a couple of days sharing ideas, doing our brainstorming. It was a little chaotic, we all are very creative and that means that we had a lot of ideas for our theme, that was \"Too long\". Some wanted to do something like a sword that grows, others a bug that grows when he eats, or a labyrinth, or a roll with infinite paint, a murder investigation, a jumping game, an infinite building, or a cinematic loop, just to mention some ideas. Yes, there were many ideas and we had a short time to make them real and that created some kind of conflict inside our little studio.\u00a0 And it could have ended in a catastrophe, however, we tried our best to talk and decide by votation the idea that we all liked, or at least the one that the most liked. An Out Run-type game.\u00a0<br/><br/>We didn't finish the game on time. We had many problems with the mechanics, the code, and the art, however, we worked together and finished together. It helped us to know each other better, our flaws and our strengths, and to see what we are capable of, on our own and as a team, as a studio, and as family. And I think that was even better than winning the Jam, that was the best reward.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Music of Fairy Police\r\n<p><em>By Lea Carrizo the \"Noisy Crow\"</em></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\r\nDirector &amp; Main Game Designer\u00a0\r\n<p>Tamar \"Mother of Crows\" Sandoval\u00a0</p>\n\r\nGame Designer Junior\u00a0\r\n<p>Josu\u00e9 \"Rookie Crow\" Gim\u00e9nez\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCinematics Director\r\n<p>\u00a0Pedro \"Corn's Crow\" L\u00f3pez\u00a0</p>\n\r\nMusic &amp; Sound Director\r\n\n<p>Lea \"Noisy Crow\" Carrizo</p>\n\n<strong>Lead Programmer\u00a0</strong>\n<p>Fran \"Potato Crow\" L\u00f3pez</p>\n\n\r\nMain Programmers\u00a0\r\n<p>Mario \"Resuscitator Crow\"\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Josu\u00e9 \"Rookie Crow\" Gim\u00e9nez</p>\n\r\nMain Artist &amp; Animator\u00a0\r\n<p>Shoko \"Dinosaur Crow\"<br/></p>\n\r\nConcept Artists\u00a0\r\n<p>Pablo \"Brushie Crow\"\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Roberto \"Monster Crow\" Leal</p>\n\r\nAdrian's Voice\u00a0\r\n<p>Fran \"Potato Crow\" L\u00f3pez<br/></p>\n\r\nQA Tester &amp; Social Media Manager\u00a0\r\n<p>Josu\u00e9 \"Rookie Crow\" Gim\u00e9nez\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:15:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa3650656db9f400fdfaaf9c27bfd695.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gas Mask War Studio"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
