{"id": 49373, "slug": "perspectrip", "name": "Perspectrip", "name_original": "Perspectrip", "description": "A mind blowing puzzle game that challenges your spatial abilities. Simple shapes are spread appart in pieces floating in a 3D space, and there is a camera angle that aligns all pieces and builds each shape. The game is played by rotating the camera around to find such angles and build shapes. When shapes are built they are removed and points get scored. Perspectrip is easy to play but hard to master. Avoid piling up too many pieces or the game can be over, use all white power-ups strategically to keep on scoring, and compare your score on baKno\u2019s Top Players list.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:48:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/8547e3f7a98d2219fe80c0f37ac344dd.jpg", "website": "http://www.bakno.com/Perspectrip", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["baKno Games"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["baKno Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
