Levels get increasingly more difficult and varied. Your main goal is to complete all the levels and get your name on the leader boards!</p>\n<p><strong>Platform</strong>: Android</p>\n<p><strong>Project Length</strong>: 3 Months</p>\n<p><strong>Engine and Tools</strong>: Unity 2019 , Photoshop, Substance Painter, Autodesk Maya </p>\n<p><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 9, 2019</p>\n<p><strong>Team Size</strong>: 4</p>\n<p><strong>My Role:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Project Manager/General Artist</strong></p>\n<p>As a Project Manager for Produce Inspector, I was a very flexible role on the team. I dealt with team conflicts and problems that rose from team members. This was a great learning experience where I can truly see how running a small team would be like and how others work productivity affected the development cycles and sprints. One of the hardest parts of being the lead was keeping the team on track after long weeks. The team struggled with time management with their other classes and I had to step in and make sure that we were still getting things done on time. If I could change my way of leading the team for next time, I would be more encouraging and having higher expectations from my teammates and be more direct with what needs to be done thoroughly so it doesn't get pushed back. We had two programmers and a 3D Modeler so I filled the gaps wherever possible and wore many hats. However, I still played the main role of making team decisions and managing which features needed to be prioritized based on time frame. I also was responsible for creating feature documentation and implementing features into the game. </p>\n<ul><li>Utilized Agile/SCRUM style of development to guide team and ensure task/feature completion.</li><li>Designed and tuned game play systems.</li><li>Ran daily stand ups and planned two week sprints.</li><li>Guided art direction and style for the game.</li><li>Designed and created all UI elements for the game.</li><li>Created all game documents and publishing files.</li><li>Constructed and Edited trailer for the game. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:21:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/314c820d8d8efdf43ab2812071b66edd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Billy Thao"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
