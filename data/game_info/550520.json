(I would have preferred completely randomly generated but I didn't have enough time because it requires an extra section of coding that checks that specific tiles that you need in each game are there.)<br/>\r\n- only to reveal the contents of each tile on the map after it has been investigated, which I achieved.<br/>\r\n- to use some of the tiles as clues to help you find the missing object tile, which I didn't achieve.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>My to do list includes:</em><br/>\r\n- fixing the variable bug. [Done!]<br/>\r\n- finishing the art.<br/>\r\n- expanding the map to add more exploration tiles to the game.<br/>\r\n- expanding the game world by adding new cases for players to investigate.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Changelog:</strong><br/>v0.9.1: Global Game Jam 2021 prototype<br/>- Quick fix for the bug with the variables.
