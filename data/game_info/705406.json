The walls were originally built for the royal family to escape quickly in case of siege. However recently engineers and merchants have observed an increase in monsters born of corrupt magics within the walls, and Eiren will need to brave these monsters as she make her way out of the city.</p>\r\nKey Features:\r\n<ul><li>Explore the bustling city of Eivune with its steampunk aesthetic.\r\n</li><li>Battle through 5 large procedurally generated floors in gripping dungeon crawling action.\r\n</li><li>Find and level up to stronger weapons, giving you the tactical advantage against the monsters.\r\n</li><li>Make use of an old cart system, leading to backrooms where merchants stored valuable goods.</li><li>Beautiful cel-shaded visuals.</li></ul>\r\nPlanned Features:\r\n<p>This is only a very small glimpse of the dark fantasy epic that we have planned as the finished game. This pre-alpha demo showcases gameplay from the game's first chapter and is very much subject to change, in the final game we have some of the following things planned\u00a0(and much more):</p>\n<ul><li>An 80+ hour RPG, with a deeply personal character driven narrative on a cosmic scale.</li><li>A vast roster of playable characters, with a variety of different classes and play styles.</li><li>Multiple weapon types and masteries, and a party system allowing for countless combinations.</li><li>Huge weapon trees and level up options for a wide variety of different characters and play-styles.</li><li>A dark narrative tied to the themes of morality, life/death, and complex shades of grey in-between.</li><li>A \"choose your own adventure\" system where decisions made can have long term consequences, potentially through multiple playthroughs.</li><li>An in-depth city building mechanic that is intimately tied to the story and the decisions you make throughout.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nTeam:\r\n<p>We are a small hobbyist team with no professional game-dev experience,\u00a0comprising of only a few people, spread across different parts of the globe (primarily meeting online). All of us united by our passion for Dark Cloud and other classic PS2-era RPG's.</p>\n<p>It has taken us about 15 Months to build and develop\u00a0this demo from an idea to what we have today (all while working around real-life responsibilities), and it's exciting to finally have our project out there.</p>\n<p>We are looking to work with more passionate individuals to help us build this game into the project that we have planned, if that sounds like something you'd be interested in then please send us an email at\u00a0<strong>zephyrstudio2020@gmail.com.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jane - Creative Lead, Modeler, 2D Artist, Lead Writer</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alec - Project Manager, Technical Lead, UI designer</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah - Associate Creative, Modeler (in training), Level designer, Writer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T11:29:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce5/ce57081d06c9422ba6c454baa227f144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zephyr-studio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
