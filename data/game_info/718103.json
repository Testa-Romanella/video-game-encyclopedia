When stepping in to do a heroic action for a change, he meets a Vulto, a kind of special agent who operates in the shadows to minimize violence and revert the damage Hevland suffered, and decides to go through heavy training to become one of them. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFollow Engel in his journey into becoming a Vulto.
