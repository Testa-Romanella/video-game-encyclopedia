The controls of the game are the following:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move, of course. When you go to platformer perspective you can use S to dash, I know pretty cool, right? If I am right you can also use the\u00a0arrow keys to move and dash and stuff.</li><li>To shoot, just click wherever you want, I had to do some quick Maths for this.</li></ul>\n<p>Also, the game should be easily be able to run at something around 120 FPS. When downloading and extracting the game, keep it in the same folder as the other files and folders otherwise you might get an error saying \"Failed to execute script main\".\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>If the game does not work,\u00a0</strong>install Python 3.8.6 here:\u00a0https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/, scroll down until you see the downloads, then after downloading it, in your terminal type, 'pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev16', this is going to be a package that you need. If this command does not work, I encourage you to watch a video on how to install python for your OS with pip. If the command worked, in the terminal go to the folder in which the game files are in and type, 'python3 main.py', this is for Linux and MacOS, for Windows it is 'python main.py', if one of them does not work on an OS try using another one, if 'python3' does not work on Linux, type in 'python' instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for something like 5\u00a0game jams. I am gonna have a YouTube Video here as well if I get the time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Edit, Here We Go:</p>\n<p>I Participate in a Game Jam, But its 5 Game Jams<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e019be147eb599e7a5f3e38e63e86a41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["devhedron_yt"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
