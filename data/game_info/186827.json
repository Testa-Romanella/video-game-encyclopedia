Once fully charged, hold RB and press B to paint your symbol.\u00a0Get 3 in a row, or 5 total to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Attack your enemy and knock them off the building to prevent captures!<br/></p>\n<p>This is multiplayer only, and requires 2 xbox controllers (or any other x-input controller). There are keyboard controls for player 1, but it's terrible.\u00a0keyboard controls removed for now.</p>\n<p>This version is a drastic improvement from the previous version. The original prototype was made\u00a0in 72 hours for a self-imposed game jam challenge with a few colleagues. We each made a game concept over the course of a weekend to decide which game concept we would go forward with. This version has updated player models from a purchased asset for prototyping, new effects, better combat, as well as sound effects and improved music implementation, as well as proper menus.</p>\n<p>Music credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\"There It Is\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Aces High\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Carnivale Intrigue\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Crunk\u00a0Knight\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Electro Cabello\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Peppy Pepe\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/029/029543a9ddb07803dec95b0a7501f097.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheBreakfast"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
