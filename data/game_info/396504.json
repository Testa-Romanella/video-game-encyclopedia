It was my goal to work on only one project over the month. I maybe committed to early to the gameplay and theme of the project. I had to adjust the gameplay and bigger parts of the game in the first half of developement and the creation process itself wasn't really satisfying, which let to me getting more and more lazy to the end of the month. I think with my next project I'm going to either stay longer in the concept phase or try an even more experimentation based approach.</p>\n<p>My biggest inspiration for the game was probably the movie \"A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence\" by Roy Andersson, which had a lot of influence on the structure of the \"story\". The Artstyle looks for me like a very simplified version of the lignie art of Moebius and different Manga-Artists. The symmetric composition of the panels was probably inspired by Wes Anderson movies.</p>\n<p>Music composed by Claude Debussy and performed by Constantin Stephan <br/></p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter for more weird stuff: \u00a0@SvenAhlgrimm<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T03:52:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d67805ddb7e07e159509e5ca497c48e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sven Ahlgrimm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
