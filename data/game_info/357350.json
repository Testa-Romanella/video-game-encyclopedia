{"id": 357350, "slug": "in-occupation", "name": "In Occupation!", "name_original": "In Occupation!", "description": "<p>In Occupation! is a game based on my own real life experience being part of a student occupation at a London university. For over a week students held an entire floor of a historical building in solidarity with striking teachers and demanding in-sourcing of staff.</p>\n<p>This experience\u00a0 taught me alot but how these sorts of occupations are run, and since then I have always wanted to express them in game form. So this jam is based off of that experience, with the player taking on collective control of the occupation, guiding the occupiers to different tasks. These included guarding doors and hallways so security cannot kick you out, agitating online to raise spirit and gather support, and good old eating and sleeping.</p>\n<p>This jam game is just a prototype of what I want to make, the base management gameplay on top of which I hope to add various events and choices the occupation must make over time, resulting in different impacts and situations.</p>\n<p>But for now enjoy a simple little game about how a small but organised group of students can fight for something much greater.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T09:05:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acfe6813a46d5e7c9b674694a62ee936.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JackFR"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
