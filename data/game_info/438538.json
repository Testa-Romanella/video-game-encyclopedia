{"id": 438538, "slug": "space-dash-vjooger", "name": "Space Dash (Vjooger)", "name_original": "Space Dash (Vjooger)", "description": "<p>Space Dash is an action game heavily inspired by the classic Space Invaders game. This is my first solo project, this project is one of my learning stepping stones.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Space dash features 4 main waves of combat, all of which are relatively short but increasing in difficulty. After you have completed the 4 main waves, endless mode is activated where the player can keep going until they run out of lives and take note of their score.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Space Dash also features two different enemy types, the bug, and the invader. The bugs spawn in masses, and have a random chance to be either static (just moving towards the player) or active (swaying rapidly back and forth), see the game-play video for more. This is random every time you play the game, and so no two playthroughs\u00a0will be the same. The invader will always by static, but will randomly shoot bullets at the player.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The player controls a rocket with either the left and right arrow keys, or A and D, and the player fires their lasers with either the up arrow or W.</p>\n<p>At any time the player can press ESC to close the game, unless the player is on the game over screen in which case the ESC key restarts the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:55:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c6/8c6a914773ca10be1a04ea83bd085efd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vjooger"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
