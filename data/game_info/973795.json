However, it doesn't take long for the skilled and talented to rise above the rest. A bit of elbow grease will allow you to quickly climb the ranks and unlock the many perks that come with promotions.<br/><br/>Your initial main task as a foot soldier will be to patrol the districts, where you'll scan the alleyways for suspicious individuals and search them for illicit goods. Like many guards in many towns, even the sentinels of Odom are corrupt... Will you choose to fine the criminals and pocket some of the money, or arrest them to advance your career? Both options will help you in one way or the other.<br/><br/>The more promotions you earn, the more perks you'll unlock. Soon you'll get to patrol richer districts, and even command your own rank-and-file soldiers to do your work for you. As a commanding officer, your subordinates' achievements also become your own! Some of the higher ranks will require buttering up your superiors, but your increased pay and a bit of saving will make short work of that, too.<br/><br/>Boundless opportunities await a ruthless and corrupt guard, and your only limit is your imagination. How far will your ambitions take you?<br/><br/><br/>Learn the layout of the town as you patrol the four districts. Criminals tend to stick to certain corners that you'll soon identify, making every sortie quick and profitable. Search and interrogate suspicious individuals and choose whether to arrest or fine them depending on your current goals.<br/><br/>Earn promotions that will both make your patrol work easier, as well as grant you access to certain privileges!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Promotions and perks</strong><br/>You'll have to work hard to climb the ranks, but with every promotion you get, you'll unlock specific perks that will make your job easier or increase your array of possibilities. You'll earn little more than a pay increase at first, but soon you'll gain access to the underground prison and even get subordinates of your own. What kind of power will you wield once you climb to the very top?<br/><br/><strong>Powered by Live2D</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T09:52:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f11674822d84d64c2a2c2d4d8f2b8ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["P.+"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Kagura Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
