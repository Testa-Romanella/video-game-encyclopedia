It has no in game tutorial, so here I'll try to explain how you can attempt to have any fun with this.. thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The steering is totally original as you can see, it totally does not copy the steering pattern of any other popular games especially not <em>The Binding of Isaac.</em></p>\n<p>Movement - WASD<br/>Shooting - Arrow Keys<br/>Switch weapon - Q<br/>Reload - R<br/>Interact - E<br/><br/>So in theory you should start with a pistol, but because of the rush I accidentaly made the player start with the most powerful weapon.\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\u00a0</p>\r\nIn game items and what they do:\r\n\n<p>(from left to right)</p>\n<p><strong>Adrenaline\u00a0- </strong>The less health you have, the more damage you can resist<br/><strong>Fiendish Blood</strong>\u00a0- The less poison resistance, the more fire resistance<br/><strong>Medicine Degree</strong>\u00a0- The less fire resistance, the more poison resistance<br/><strong>Specialist\u00a0</strong>\u00a0- The less damage resistance, the more poison and fire resistance<br/><strong>Fear </strong>\u00a0- The less health, the more speed<br/><strong>Tank\u00a0\u00a0</strong>-<strong>\u00a0</strong>The less speed, the more resistance</p>\n\r\nContent\r\n<p>There is a total of 9 procedurally generated levels, which make up three differently themed floors, each with it's own difficulty level. You should be able to fight against several types of enemies, but sometimes the rooms glitch. </p>\r\nCredits\r\n\n\n\n<li>used font: FFF Forward</li><li>music: Mateusz Krusiewicz</li><li>cool graphics stuff: @WalkanFL, Dragster</li><li>sounds: @WalkanFL, @REafiki</li><li>less cool graphics stuff: @bajtix</li><li>ideas and making annoying microwave sound: mobex</li><li>glitches bugs and all the terrible code. also forcing the rest of the team to work 24 hours a day and beeing a little too toxic sometimes: @bajtix</li>\r\nSome backstory and notes and other cool stuff and just my thoughts idk\r\n<p>I am not proud of this game. Even more, we as a team are not proud of this game. To be honest, it looks and works how it does because of me (@bajtix) and my own laziness. It was pretty hard for me to keep up with school stuff, and still create something for the jam. It was supposed to be a smaller project, but ended up with me bugfixing stuff 7 minutes before the deadline. I really hope that I will be able to release a full-er version after the jam ends, but I'm dissapointed in myself, as I wasted a lot of time during the jam on procrastination. To be honest, at the time of writing this I haven't even completed the game once. I had a lot of fun making this, and the \"core\" is more or less complete. It is mainly the lack of content that is the problem. The artists worked so hard on creating lots of assets that ended up not getting into the build because of me. Still, I think &amp; hope that this lil' game will be able to bring you some joy or sth. Have fun! \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:44:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81c/81c6e09dfc65f01bcf71aa7909cbffaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bajtix", "WalkanFL"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
