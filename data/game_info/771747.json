Where you change between attempts, but the world changes within your attempts. Where you are your own tutorial. And where you get to beat everybody else's best completion times.</p>\n<p>Use your trustworthy remote-controlled mechs to explore as much as possible of the bottom of the Abyss. Fight the enviromnent across all of its aspects -- but don't worry about losing one of them -- you can always deploy another mech. Even getting destroyed still leaves valuable items on the bottom of the sea and valuable information in your maps.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>PS. if you don't find the most hostile places to be seen challenging enough, you can try beating our record time :)</p>\n\n<p>Assets used in no particular order:<br/>- Bungee\u00a0font by D.\u00a0Ross<br/>- LowPoly\u00a0Rocks by SnowFiend\u00a0Studios<br/>- Stylize\u00a0Water\u00a0Texture by LowlyPoly<br/>- Low\u00a0Poly\u00a0Desert by 23\u00a0Space\u00a0Robots<br/>- Buoy by Cross\u00a0Walk\u00a0Studios<br/>- Seamless\u00a0Lava\u00a0Texture by Innovana\u00a0Games<br/>- Yughues Sand Materials by Yughues<br/>- Angler Fish by lesliestowe<br/>- Torpedo by Godless Laboratories<br/>- Swimming\u00a0Shark by AIUM2<br/>- Seamlesstextures by Seamlesstextures<br/>- Shader\u00a0FX\u00a0Masks by Dymental<br/>- AK-47 Bullet by Alien7878<br/>- 5 meters dive by bruno.auzet<br/>- Footsteps - Essentials by Nox_Sound<br/>- Small pistol gunshot indoors by acidsnowflake<br/>- gunshot ricochet by bevibeldesign<br/>- underwater explosion by cubix<br/>- Aggresor, Wholesome, Shadowlands, Night of Chaos, Dark Fog by Kevin Macleod<br/>- Giant Marine\u00a0Turtle by Natural History Museum Vienna</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T07:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bce7a667d9face78fdf9e8da5426775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["CoalZombik", "Martuss", "SlunkyIsHere", "RudolfJelin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
