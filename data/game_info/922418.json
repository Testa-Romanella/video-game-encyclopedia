I am not sure if I am going to continue it.\u00a0 \u00a0 However, feedback is appreciated.</p>\n<p>There is local-coop support but it is buggy.\u00a0 Also important to note is that menus do not completely support a controller. You'll have to use your mouse to interact with menus.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I'm interested in porting it to Android but the performance is currently an issue.</p>\n<p>Game size is currently\u00a0 ~1.13GB.
