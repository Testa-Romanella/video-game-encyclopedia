The main character, Digby, sets out from their home settlement with the hopes of establishing a new settlement. They are joined by a team of misfits, who seem, at first, to be more of a hindrance than a help. The aim of the game is to encourage the player to think more mindfully about how humanity treats nature and perhaps change some of their habits to be more environmentally positive.</p>\n\n<p>Tell me what you think! </p>\n<p>game blog - chasm.game.blog</p>\n<p>insta - ecgamesdesign</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50e/50e028c0ed91ba6989be91c4a97b8c9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emily Clay"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
