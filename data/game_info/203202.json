When any hero with \"Party skill\" died, other heroes also lose him \"Party skill\". Unlike \"Personal skills\".<br/>---<br/><strong>Why respawn button has ad?</strong></p><p>We don't planned button \"respawn\" and any ads, but... I doubt that you click the \"donate\" button, if we add it. Unfortunately, game sponsors are not interested in buying these types of games.</p><p>You can pass all game without respawn.<br/>---<br/><strong>Inspired by \"Frantic Frigates\" (and \"Snake Squad\")</strong><br/><br/>Gameplay like at \"Frantic Frigates\", but your earned money &amp; upgrades WITH YOU. \"Frantic\" RESET your money &amp; upgrades after each die, but give rank and some starting $. We love to experiment with game mechanics. So thanks for your experience.<br/>---<br/>Thanks all for your feedbacks!<br/>We welcome your suggestions and ideas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c7b56eb8bc95a456e65e70f5663fedd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["activegames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
