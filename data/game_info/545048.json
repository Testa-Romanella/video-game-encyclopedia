Play with up to three other players in this light-hearted game about robots, alien cacti and attempts at teamwork!<h3>Gameplay Features:</h3><ul><li>4-player co-op through local play or via Steam Remote Play<br/></li><li>Avoid dangerous cacti and stop them from overrunning your base<br/></li><li>Scrap all resources and carry them back to your recycler<br/></li><li>Reload, maintain and relocate a variety of turrets to protect your operation<br/></li><li>Fetch ammo in time before the turrets run out -- throw it if you have to!</li></ul>This game was designed to be played with <strong>gamepads.</strong><br/><br/><h3>Help Wanted!</h3><br/>Deconstruction Corp., the second best recycling mega-corporation in the galaxy is looking for new expendable and easily replaceable robot workers to help scavenge the last valuable resources from a dying planet filled with hostile, non-sentient lifeforms.<br/><br/><br/>When a planet has an abundance of resources (natural or otherwise) it is your job to collect and repurpose them. Your task will be to locate and smash these resources into manageable pieces, and then bring them back to The Recycler\u2122 to prepare them for orbital collection. The Recycler\u2122 is very susceptible to clogging. Do not put non-recyclable objects into The Recycler\u2122. Do not, under any circumstance, put living entities into The Recycler\u2122, sentient or otherwise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Requirements<br/><ul><li>Complete and utter respect for co-workers.<br/></li><li>A good sense for gathering and/or avoiding hostile flora.<br/></li><li>The ability to find and collect valuable resources under stressful circumstances, such as being chased by hostile flora in the line of fire of deadly armaments.</li></ul><br/><br/>On occasions where a planet's resources fight back, you will need to defend your recycling station and supply chain. You will be in charge of the well-being of our Turret-Centric Automated Weapon Systems by providing the weaponry with the correct ammunition, and by re-locating them to achieve an optimal bullet-per-second-output. Remember, while you are expendable and easily replaced, our equipment is not, and it is your job to keep it safe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Requirements<br/><ul><li>The proper educational degree needed to carry and drop heavy objects.<br/></li><li>A basic knowledge of the deployment and maintenance of deadly armaments.<br/></li><li>The foresight to collect and dispense the correct kind of volatile ammunition to the deadly armaments before they run dry during an ongoing attack.</li></ul><br/><br/>When push comes to shove there always needs to be someone with superb managerial skills and/or who shouts really loud. It will be your job to make sure your co-workers are staying on-task, and to call out anything that needs urgent attention. As leadership skill is directly proportional to the volume of one's voice, we encourage anyone applying for a middle management position to practice leadership by shouting commands at their peers at all times.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Requirements<br/><ul><li>The organizational skill to manage a crew of highly destructible corporate property, with a minimal loss of said property.<br/></li><li>The ability to delegate dangerous tasks to less important co-workers, sometimes by literally throwing them to the right spot.<br/></li><li>A keen eye for noticing when a co-worker is slacking off, and the determination and know-how to do their job for them if necessary.</li></ul><br/><br/>Besides being the only authorized clothing, different uniforms and adornments will also be your main form of compensation. You will be able to choose from a wide variety of company approved cosmetics, all with a multitude of benefits: <br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Show off your well-earned accomplishments!</strong> Jealous co-workers will try extra hard to earn the same rewards, increasing company productivity.<br/></li><li><strong>Wear locally procured objects as hats</strong>! By avoiding calling them \u2018trophies\u2019, we bypass several laws and regulations regarding the import of hazardous materials and the protection of endangered species.. <br/></li><li><strong>Spread cheer and joy with your robot colleagues!</strong> Company morale is everyone\u2019s responsibility, and any drop in employment happiness will be met with a severe reduction to the employee entertainment budget..</li></ul><br/><br/>Deconstruction Corp. tackles jobs all over the galaxy, and no situation or environment is too dangerous for our brave workers. As one of our brave workers, here are some samples of the many, many dangerous conditions you might be expected to encounter:<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Hostile Flora<br/></li><li>Hostile Fauna<br/></li><li>Other types of hostile Non-Recyclables<br/></li><li>Malfunctional machinery<br/></li><li>Functional but hostile machinery<br/></li><li>Deadly pits (with and/or without bottom)<br/></li><li>Rivers of acid<br/></li><li>Explosions, live turret fire and electrocutions<br/></li><li>Confused co-workers<br/></li><li>Angry co-workers<br/></li><li>Fleeing co-workers attracting a swarm of hostiles towards you</li></ul><br/><br/>If you qualify for any or all of these positions, or if you find your particular skills would be an asset to Deconstruction Corp., don\u2019t hesitate to mention this to your manufacturer when you are packed and shipped towards a hostile planet as part of your mandatory assignment to Deconstruction Corp. You might be a robot built by the lowest bidder, but we value your efforts, and we are confident that you would choose this assignment even if you had, in fact, a choice.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/>Brain-in-a-Jar, Regional Manager<br/>Deconstruction Corp.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T02:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c18a40331b0aecc73feefb17e4d272a.jpg", "website": "https://www.frogsong-studios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frogsong Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Frogsong Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
