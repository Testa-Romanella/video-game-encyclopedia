Your goal is to escape from the robotic uprising, taking down any machines that stand in your way! Do you have what it takes to make it out?</p>\n<p>The adventurers draw their strength from chance, and they rely on dice to grant them strength and agility in combat. However, a low roll does not simply mean the end, as it can allow you to unleash as slower, yet much stronger attack. Be careful, as your enemies also harness the same luck that you do, and also use devious traps to prevent escape.</p>\n<p>(This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022.
