If you choose the correct tile, you'll get extra time, but if you choose one of the wrong ones - well, then your time will decrease immediately.<br/>So choose wisely, be fast, but first, don't forget to download the game! <br/><br/>Does anyone ever even read these long descriptions?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:31:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/030/03086b6ae3352427b769224f666fa96d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Monika Gergely"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Monika Gergely"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
