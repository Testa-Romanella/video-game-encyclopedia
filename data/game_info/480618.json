{"id": 480618, "slug": "the-forgotten-path", "name": "The Forgotten Path", "name_original": "The Forgotten Path", "description": "<p>\"The Forgotten Path\", We made this Game for a jam with the theme \"LOST\".<br/>.<br/>This game depicts a character (you), which is stuck in a void like realm. You have to explore the ruins left behind in this realm to discover the true path. Then and only then is when you can escape from this realm. But how did you find yourself stuck in this realm? what is the true path? and why are there structures in the ruins in a void like world in the first place? There's only one way to find out ;)))<br/>.<br/>We added a Progression based narrative which encourages you to keep exploring. Since this is or first game it may have a few shortcomings and a few bugs here and there so please do give us feedback so we can improve this game and do better on our future projects. We had a great time working on this project and hope you enjoy playing it too :)))</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b1/6b1b594f1a7057611ab927f437ce03b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RumiSpawn", "Tayyab Abbas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
