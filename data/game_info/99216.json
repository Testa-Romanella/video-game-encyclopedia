The Surrealist explorative first-person adventure game.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Gameplay<br/></strong><br/>The basic element of gameplay is the ability to forget. Some elements in the surroundings change when the player turns away or leaves, and become more than just a direction sign: they become the way along which the player walks, flies and falls. Finding such a way to the higher levels is a matter of his aptness and intuition, rewarded by advancing higher.<br/><br/><strong>Story<br/></strong><br/>If you fall asleep while stargazing, a gate to a new world situated in between the world of memories and the world of dreams will open for you. That intermediate world gradually turns reality to fragments and infuses the player with the desire to know the unknowable. But the most persistent can feel the unknowable.<br/><br/>\"You count the stars above your head just like the one who pointed a finger at you from the unknown. The closer you get to infinity, the more you get lost in the numbers created to describe the real world, and your eyelids become curtains that hide unexpected discoveries beyond the borders, reached by only the strongest thoughts. This exciting play for one spectator is a reward for everyday gifts of the mind.\"<br/><br/><strong>Features<br/><br/></strong>\u2013 varied environments<br/>\u2013 living entities<br/>\u2013 more than 20 levels<br/>\u2013 electronic and classic music<br/>\u2013 spoken word</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-24T22:33:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b73/b7387fc6c3a9a86898cf71ecec664f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HANGONIT"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
