{"id": 56685, "slug": "panther", "name": "Panther", "name_original": "Panther", "description": "<p>Panther is a Commodore 64 game designed and implemented by Peter Adams and published by Mastertronic in 1986. An Atari 8-bit family version followed in 1987, then a ZX Spectrum port in 1989. The player pilots a strange-looking aircraft, fighting off hordes of invading flying saucers and rescuing people by landing the craft and waiting for them to board. The game uses a diagonally scrolling isometric view, much like Zaxxon and Blue Max, using shadows to show the height of flying objects. Adams previously worked ports of both of those games.</p>\n<p>The Commodore 64 disk packaged Panther with L.A. SWAT, another Mastertronic game. The A-side of the disk contained the two programs for the C64/128, while the B-side contained Atari 8-bit family versions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Sculptured Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Mastertronic"], "esrb_rating": null}
