Be careful not to get too hot, or it could be detrimental to the penguin's health.</p>\n<p>Slide around loops, cool in water pools, and fly over lava pits to escape Africa and return to the familiar cold of Antarctica.<br/></p>\n<p>This was based on the game jam theme \"What do you call a penguin in Africa?
