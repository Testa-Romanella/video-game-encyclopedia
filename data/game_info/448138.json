Build a horde, make it through their defenses and take your revenge !</p>\n<p>Horde is a\u00a0physics based zombie horde simulator.

I also had no time to fix the audio loops, that's why it sounds\u00a0kinda botched.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a MAC build because unity let me do it but i have no machine to test it on, if it doesn't work on your MAC i wont be able to help you, but please tell me if it is broken so i can remove it from the game's page.</p>\n<p>It has been a lot of fun and i will probably keep experimenting on this project and add more levels / mechanics.</p>\n<p>The 3D assets are from\u00a0SYNTY Studios,\u00a0i don't have to credit them but they make really good affordable stuff, i loved playing with those assets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want to support my work you can whishlist PARADOX on steam.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing Horde !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:37:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/084/0849cfa249b6eb699e79c2fcede3b89b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["bl4st"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
