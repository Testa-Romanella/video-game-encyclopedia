You can click on and see different places in any order you want and discover various objects. But watch out, sirens are approaching!</p>\n<p>{Spoiler Alert}</p>\n<p>The ending is ambiguous, reflecting the actual situation of an amnesia patient, in which the truth of the past can only be inferred but not assured, due to the nature of memory loss. Thus, it\u2019s more important to reason the connection between clues and the truth rather than pursuing the truth itself, which makes both endings justifiable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits: See the final page of the game.
