This project is far from complete, but I'm considering fleshing it out a lot more soon. I never entered a jam before, so I wanted to contribute what I had gotten done, anyway.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>COEXISTENCE<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The premise of the game is you play as both a light and shadow character simultaneously. When one of them walks, the other walks. When one jumps, the other jumps - assuming they aren't in the air at the time. If one dies, then both reset at the beginning of the stage. You have to use both of them to reach the end, using the geography of the stage to your advantage. If one jump seems impossible, try separating them a bit and attempting it again.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move, space bar to jump.<br/></p>\n<p>In the future, I want to add music/sounds, a proper menu and level select, updated graphics, and obviously, more levels. <br/></p>\n<p>Please let me know any feedback you have - I'm open to criticism!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T08:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d495796428750e2ee79148ccc43b44a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kaerfca"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
