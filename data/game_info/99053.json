Grab a blaster, princess, because the Falcon's not coming. It's up to you to fight your way to the surface and escape.</p>\n<p>If you're playing on a phone or tablet, use the onscreen controls. If you're playing on a keyboard, here are some shortcuts:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>MOVE</strong> - WASD or Arrows</li><li><strong>SHOOT</strong> - X or K or SPACE</li><li><strong>STRAFE</strong> - Z or L or SHIFT</li></ul>\n<p>On each level, find the MAP to see where you are. Find the COMPASS to see where you need to go to reach the next elevator. Good luck!</p>\n<p>This game requires WebGL. It works best in Chrome or Firefox, but honestly it hasn't been tested very well. If it doesn't work for you, please leave a comment telling me what kind of hardware and browser you're using. Thanks! :D</p>\n<p>This is my first itch.io game jam submission.
