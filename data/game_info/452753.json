The snake grows if you let him eat an apple. Unlike the classic snake game, you know from the old nokia phones, this snake has gravity.<br/><br/>In the game, you need to eat all the apples in 20 levels to find your lost love. The worm grows in size when it eats an apple. If at least one part of his body is not placed on any surface, he will fall. <br/><br/>Also, the worm cannot move in the opposite direction, so it can get entangled in its own body. Also in the game, there are elements that cannot be touched.<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1042330/Tricky_Cat/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T03:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bc9af91a0cf98369f8fe4ce1e34fba7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Nannings", "NanningsGames"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["NanningsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
