Each Chapter of the game uses the mechanics and idea of basketball in a different way. At one point you might be dribbling inside the intestines of a purple blob creature. At others, you're likely to be dunking above the clouds in front of the Parisian moon. <br/><br/>A dynamic soundtrack and unique cardboard visuals help tell the story of a sister who must be saved through the power of basketball.Key Features<ul><li>Dunk, dribble, and crossover through 8 Chapters spanning throughout the impromptu courts of Paris <br/></li><li>Each Chapter takes the mechanics of basketball and applies them in different ways. Some chapters are more action, some are more puzzle. And then there are the strange chapters. <br/></li><li>Music is tied directly to the gameplay, though it's all passively controlled. For example, every time you dribble, you hear a bass hit. Shoot the ball, and the percussion stops. <br/></li><li>Visuals in the game are a unique mix of cardboard and color, every scene popping off the screen. </li></ul>Bonus ContentIncluded with the game! :D<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>The BasketBelle EP</strong>: Full Soundtrack + Bonus Tracks (MP3) + Cover Art <br/></li><li><strong>BasketBelle sketchbook</strong>: Full-color PDF including sketches and liner notes<br/></li><li>Browser version of <strong>BasketBelle</strong> (playable on Mac and Linux as well, but not through the Steam launcher)<br/></li><li>Access to <strong>Making Of Featurette</strong>!
