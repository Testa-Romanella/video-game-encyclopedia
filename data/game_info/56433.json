It is a sequel to Singleton's 1984 seminal The Lords of Midnight and has similar game mechanics but adds more detail and complexity with the number of characters and locations increased.</p>\n<p>In Doomdark's Revenge, the hero of the first game, Luxor the Moonprince, goes into the savage wastes of Icemark to save his son Morkin and defeat the evil Empress Shareth, daughter of his enemy Doomdark. Despite what the title suggests, Doomdark himself, who was killed in the first game, does not actually return in the sequel.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, Doomdark's Revenge was a major critical success and a commercial hit. It was supposed to be followed the sequel titled Eye of the Moon in 1989, which was never finished. Another sequel, Lords of Midnight: The Citadel, was eventually released in 1995.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8d/a8d0d193a021e097b79bd0a457d42370.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC", "Classic Macintosh", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Mike Singleton"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Beyond Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
