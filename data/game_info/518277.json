As you travel from planet to planet, your worlds will become slightly less tiny and your enemies more numerous.\u00a0You have limited health however as you kill enemies you gain experience points. Collect enough experience and you will level up! Leveling up will increase your max health. Your health is also re-filled after you complete each planet.</p>\r\nTips:\r\n<p>The direction you are facing affects the color of your attacks. Enemies can only be hurt by the same color attack. (Red attack kills Red enemies...) You can jump over enemies and hit them from behind if you must. Touching enemies will hurt you.\u00a0<br/>Killing enemies of the same color in succession will award BONUS EXP! You can destroy your own range power shot by hitting it with an opposite shot.
