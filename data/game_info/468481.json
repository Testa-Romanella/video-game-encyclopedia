Find out in this game made for the GMTK Jam July 2020.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A/D - move left/right</p>\n<p>Space - jump</p><p>Space while in the air - double jump</p>\n<p>The Jetpack is your way of movement. Too bad it doesn't work properly: the power for upwards and forwards thrust are out of control! The meters on the edge of the screen show you the current power. Use it wisely to make it to the end of the level!</p>\n<p>Idea, design, models, sounds, music etc are made by me using the following tools:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity 2019.4.3f1: Engine</li><li>Blender 2.82.7: 3D Models</li><li>Aseprite: Color Palette</li><li>Krita: Graphics</li><li>Guitar Pro 5: Music</li><li>Sfxr: Sound Effects</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T20:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72d/72def82e70c76d4062fe3c5cc155e916.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pidibidi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
