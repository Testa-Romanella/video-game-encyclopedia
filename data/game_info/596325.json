{"id": 596325, "slug": "runner-ore", "name": "Runner Ore", "name_original": "Runner Ore", "description": "<p>You play as an underpaid mining worker, whose job is to travel down the dark abandoned mines in order to extract some ore. Not simply any ore, though. The ore you obtained are from cute walking boulders called OreBoys that you have to smack with your pickaxe.</p>\n<p>You move around with WASD or the arrow keys. Press left shift to run, but be careful to not run out of stamina. Left click on the screen in order to throw your pickaxe in that direction. Throw your pickaxe at the OreBoys.</p>\n<p>The OreBoys start out by sleeping. When you approach a sleeping OreBoy, they will wake up and run away. Running towards an OreBoy will allow them to wake up earlier, so be careful. If you stay far away from OreBoys for a while, they will return to sleep. Try not to get lost from chasing around OreBoys.</p>\n<p>Hitting an OreBoy allows you to collect a single piece of Ore. If you destroy an OreBoy, you will get an extra piece of Ore. Collect 25 Ores and return to the stairs in order to finish the game. Try to do this as fast as possible!</p>\n<p>Sadly, there is absolutely no audio in the game at the moment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:55:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a24/a245e42a99fe2cff8db4a91e18631844.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ThatANonoWord"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
