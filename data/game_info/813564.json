You wear the flag of a country that was shelled out of existence nearly two kiloyears ago on Earth. The then CCCP won the space race. With the ability to control nearly all of space, it allowed them to influence economies and start conflicts. In a ten year period after the first landing on Mars, the CCCP declared war on its parent country, and then the world. Sides were taken, and bombs were dropped from outer space. CCCP and it\u2019s allies were able to obliterate the majority of the opposition. This alliance of tyrannical world-enders was renamed the Federation a few hundred years later. Only after the first interstellar colonies were sent to a nearby solar system was the invention of sub-light speed travel. The Federation rules most of space in the current year. However, during the Great Evacuation of 2110 remaining freedom forces were able to commandeer a CCCP ship and plunge into outer space. You\u2019ve inherited the responsibility of your ancestors to preserve the history of the United States. In the current year, the freedom fighters have but only a small planet with the technological advancement comparable to pre-war. Up against the universe controlling giant, the US Freedom Fighters are unable to mount any offensives. The USFF has taken great care, and nearly insurmountable risk to put you in your current position. You are born American and belong to the USFF, but you are a member of the Federation. You will stance yourself so that, upon your activation, you can return to Lazarus with the intelligence and tools needed to bring the Federation to its knees. <br/><strong>God bless you, God bless the USFF, and God bless America.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Interstellar space travel</strong><br/>Fly your chosen ship throughout an entire solar system without loading screens. From the blackness of outer space to boots-on-the-ground, the entire universe is simulated without scene transitions!<br/>Land on terrestrial planets, fly the rings of massive gas giants and see the aurora over planets never yet discovered by man - all in your quest to cripple the Federation. Travel from system to system through gargantuan holes, and experience the gravity of a billion suns. See the specs of light fly by your windscreen and know they represent an American future yet to hold and a past never to forget. <br/><br/><strong>Station Based Economy</strong><br/>Buy and sell resources, ships, and people at stations scattered across many solar systems. Use your knowledge of specific systems to fill a gap in the supply of certain items to advance yourself economically. Commit yourself to Federal missions, to gain standing at those stations for economic and political benefit.<br/><br/><strong>Deep Space Mining</strong><br/>Use your ship\u2019s mining equipment to crack ring asteroids like geodes. Pick the right rock and strike gold, pick the wrong one and spread dust. Collect the resources mined and sell them at a local station. Increase your standing at stations by interacting with them economically.<br/><br/><strong>Combat in Space</strong><br/>Equip yourself to stand up against any foe. Train yourself to use your ship\u2019s maneuverability to your advantage. Commit yourself to the elimination of space pirates, rebel against the system authorities, and grow your wealth and influence.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T04:29:50", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZERO"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ZERO"], "esrb_rating": null}
