To do this the character has a shield, whose color he can change. The enemies shoot projectiles in 3 colors (RGB), and the robot is only able to reflect them if its shield matches this color. He also has a dash feature and a pick up which lets him choose the color of the projectiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Game made for the 2019 MAD Game Jam. Developed by a team of three.</p>\n<p>The project was really well received, but the controls are a little difficult to get used to, and the player needs to be forced to moved around more. However, this project was extremely fun to make and we are hoping to continue it in the future.</p>\n<p>A controller is needed to play the game, sorry :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T03:34:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e2de2884ea5a1e4067467cbc7c28b45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lick'a'pig"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
