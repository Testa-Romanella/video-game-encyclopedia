Neons and lasers! What else do you need?</strong></p>\n\n<p>BufferMAN is a retro-inspired plataformer prototype with the sights put into puzzle solving and speedrunning. The core mechanincs are simple enough, but mastery will be difficult.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>The prototype is in a proof-of-concept stage, but all the elements are there, and if it gets at least a few guys interested, I will continue the game polishing details and making more levels+mechanincs. I love this sutff :)<br/></p>\n\n<p>Feel free to give it a try and a review! I will take everything into account :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2f5784ab33d1645f921adde29c1370a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Akryllax"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
