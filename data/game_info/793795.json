Using special AK-47, blast your way through hordes of space marines. Fail and you should die (again).\r\nNOTE: This is a prototype that was created during a game jam. There will be plenty of bugs left over from the space marines. Based on the community feedback, an entire game may be created to continue Zombo's journey.\r\n Gamepad or mouse can be used to move around and shoot. Unlimited ammo, but only 7 health pick-ups for the entire game.
