{"id": 750366, "slug": "fleshchild", "name": "Fleshchild", "name_original": "Fleshchild", "description": "<p>Fleshchild is a semi-episodic exploration/adventure game, similar to and inspired by Yume Nikki. You follow a baby eldritch abomination-type entity named Vis as it &quot;grows up&quot; at the behest of its parent, a giant red eyeball who lives in a sewer. The game has two main segments: Reality, and Dreaming.</p>\n<p>Reality: Vis explores sections of Ashvale city to find whatever body parts its parent requests for the night. Gameplay in reality involves exploration, item collection, solving simple puzzles, and maybe killing people for body parts. Vis can get advice from its fellows in the sewer, alongside Visybil, who can provide more information on the objective and plot.</p>\n<p>Dreaming: Vis explores their dreams as they sleep during the day. Gameplay in dreams involves exploration and item collection, and later on will include puzzles. The dreams end abruptly and without warning, so thoroughly exploring one THEMED location (such as the entirety of a hospital) before moving to the next will reward Vis with the best experience each dream has to offer.</p>\n<p>Background:<br />\nVis is only one of many, but they may be the first. They are awoken from their sleep by their parent, a being so immense, only its single eye can be comprehended when gazed upon. It&#39;s time for Vis to grow up.</p>\n<p>However, in order to grow, Vis will need to \u201cborrow\u201d a few parts from the lovely people living upstairs. The game begins with Vis\u2019s first emergence in the cover of night. Now that they are free to wander outside the sewer, they must hunt down all the parts they need to make themselves a proper adult. Unfortunately, people won\u2019t like lending Vis a hand if it costs an arm and a leg to do it!</p>\n<p>WARNINGS:<br />\nThis game features copious amounts of visual violence, gore, blood, body horror, and a host of other things. Be wary of playing if you are sensitive to any of the above.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T00:48:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/229/2292f40a403dfe2fa3f79c26a69bfa60.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/9308/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
