They are known as SAKURA STARS. <br/>Take on hordes of youkai in this 8bit horizontal shmup and defend humanity from supernatural beings. <br/><br/>Sakura Stars is a game made on Pico-8, a retro fantasy console with purposeful limitations and low-resolution to simulate an 8-bit era console.<br/>But like modern shmups, the player has a small hitbox, indicated for a circle, allowing a greater number of enemy shots on the screen, as well as patterns with closer shots.<br/><br/>The characters have an artistic style of Japanese anime, purposely made in low resolution to create, together with the music, a more casual and relaxed atmosphere.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li>Three characters, each with a different shooting pattern, and different speed. Choose the one that best fits your playing style.<br/><br/></li><li>Enemy waves have a fixed pattern, encouraging them to be memorized to facilitate gameplay. Just like old arcade games.<br/><br/></li><li>Four levels in retro style. Face Youkai girls at the end of each one.<br/><br/></li><li>Soundtrack by authors of classical music, in chiptune style<br/><br/></li><li>Made on Pico-8, a fictional virtual console, created to impose the limitations and low-resolution of the 8bit era and simulate the sensation of playing a game from that time.<br/><br/></li><li>Anime like pixel art style. Drawn pixel by pixel, in a 16-color palette.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T04:40:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/218c0c0289900b9ff728bcfd53f8c999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Super16bits"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Super16bits"], "esrb_rating": null}
