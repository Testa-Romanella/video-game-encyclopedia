You play as a driver passing through a mountain road late at night, when you spot a hitchhiker flagging you down up ahead. How you proceed from there determines not only the fate of you and the wide-eyed stranger you meet, but your combined fates across multiple planes of existence. In a cycle that seems to torment you for\u00a0<strong>INFINITY</strong>, how long will it take for you to finally arrive at the\u00a0<strong>THRESHOLD</strong>? Will you find the better ending you seek? Or will you succumb to what fate has in store for you?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>--- FEATURES:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>15k+ words</li><li>A dark, surreal narrative inspired by campfire ghost stories, found footage horror films, and modern day fables\r\n</li><li>Branching story paths that change with every ending\r\n</li><li>18 different endings (not including variants)</li><li>An incredible original soundtrack by\u00a0Sam Tudor\u00a0inspired by games like Silent Hill and Oxenfree\r\n</li><li>Free to play (although donations are always appreciated)\r\n</li><li>Blood, sweat, and tears\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>--- BEFORE YOU PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>Due to the nature of this game, there are limited opportunities to \"save\" your progress.
