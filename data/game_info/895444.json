A little game in which words appear and disappear after a few seconds to find them in a word search after all the words disappear.</p>\n<p>Lately, memory or mobility are questions that I have to keep in mind and try to train them more frequently. I was testing an asset I bought from the Unity Asset Store. After I had tested it and played a little with it, I had an idea. The idea of adding some scripts and elements to create a little game to exercise short-term or retentive memory.<br/></p>\n\n<p>* Asset used as base for the wordsearch minigame</p>\n<p>- DTT :\u00a0Word Finder Game Template</p>\n<p>* Graphic used created by</p>\n<p>- Ricimi: Cartoon GUI Pack</p>\n<p>* Music used created by</p>\n<p>-Kummelmusic -\u00a0lofi world vol 1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T14:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d2/8d2c059e29cf453b2f41a3d1847a8de6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Melpermo"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
