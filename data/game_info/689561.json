When this was done, I thought it would be interesting to see the generated land come to live: To see heroes travelling down the roads, conquering castles, visiting taverns and, of course, battling amongst themselves. So I've added this also.<br/></p>\n<p>I wouldn't call this a game, as there is no actual user interaction. The map is generated, and then the battle begins, and continues until one side is victorious. The algorithms are very straightforward and there is no complex intelligence in heroes' actions. Nonetheless, I think it is interesting to watch, so I'm publishing it here for those, also interested in procedural generation.<br/></p>\n<p>armies-and-castles@yandex.ru<br/></p>\n<p>* GitHub<br/></p>\n<p>*\u00a0Twitter</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Use settings.txt to change resolution and the graphics style.
