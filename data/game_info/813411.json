Motorcycles.<br/></p>\n<p>With that astute description out of the way, this demo is very... bare. My original attempt really didn't go anywhere, so I threw it all out last sunday and started over. It was a top-down view style game, which really didn't work. I mean this really doesn't work all that well either, but you can at least imagine a parallel universe where this version of the gameplay has something. At least that's how I feel and I'll keep working towards that. And yeah, I'm still not all that rock solid on Godot, tested the shading stuff a bit with that, it's pretty intuitive.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing/testing!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls for HTML5/Windows:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>A - Swing/Accelerate/Advance text</li><li>Move - Arrow\u00a0keys \r\n</li><li>Spacebar/Enter - Advance Game Over screen/Title Screen</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional not</strong><strong>es:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Original release date: 01/07/2022\r\n</li><li>Shaders borrowed and adapted to Godot:\u00a0 Portal shader, Trippy shader 1, Trippy shader 2</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T17:15:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9de41181e5d9fabe7a3f24ff0de0838d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Captain Dreamcast"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
