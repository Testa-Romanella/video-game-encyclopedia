We fear this may be your fault. Your fellow co-workers are cramming themselves into the halls to form an oddly organized line <strong>converging on your cubicle</strong> workstation. <strong>Solve at least 75% or more of their requests</strong> for the following 3 days and you will not be terminated. Failure to address this request will result in <strong>immediate termination</strong> (and also <strong>DEATH.</strong>)</em></p>\r\nSincerest many love thanks,\r\n\n<p><strong><em>This project </em></strong>is<strong><em>was for the Brackeys Game Jam.</em></strong></p>\n<p>I was unable to form a concrete gameplay element for the game, and the amount of assets I am unable to create on my own made it impossible for me alone to do in 7 days with my current set of skills and tools. Unreal is not a 2D engine. The fate of the project is unknown.</p>\n<p>\r\nLocal Forecast - Slower by Kevin MacLeod<br/>\r\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3988-local-forecast---slower<br/>\r\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T08:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/5668666d2cf3fab4409edc072ff775b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Windzyboy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
