Your resistance group sent you explore an enemy base probably abandoned, in order to loot weapons and resources left on site.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first part of the exploration is in vain, the bunker having been emptied of its weapons and main resources. Only corpses remain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s when you decide to enter an elevator shaft that wasn't indicated on the plans found. \"</p>\n\n<p>There are still bugs in the game, but they don't interfere too much with the player's experience: some enemies will seem invincible, the balls do not damage them. Just move and attack them from a new location (it's a trigger problem for connoisseurs)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>A rifle is to be found in the game and greatly facilitates the progression.
