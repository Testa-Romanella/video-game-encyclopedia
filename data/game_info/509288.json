{"id": 509288, "slug": "hermetica", "name": "Hermetica", "name_original": "Hermetica", "description": "<p>Hermetica is a thinking matching puzzle game in which the player will need to complete multiple boards by matching runes by shape and/or color.\u00a0 Rows and columns of the board can be cleared when they are entirely filled with runes, and once every square on the board is filled the player can then proceed to the next level which will have a larger set of rune shapes and colors, increasing the level of difficulty. \u00a0If a rune can not be placed on the board it can be discarded into the pit of the Ouroborus serpent which will then rotate, and once the serpent has made a complete circle the game is over. The game has two modes: strategic and timed trial. In strategic mode the player can plan out each move, but in timed trial the serpent will automatically rotate and there is a time limit to each move.</p>\n<p>During game play, special runes will appear that will alter the rules of the game.\u00a0 The Phoenix will allow a player to destroy an existing rune, and arrows may appear allowing the player to strategically move an existing rune on the board.</p>\n<p>The game is currently available in two theme packs: the \"Zodiac\" theme pack which includes shifting backgrounds of magic circles, and the \"Animal\" or \"Exploding Unicorn\" theme pack which includes elusive and confusing unicorns, which will move around the board changing the colors of the other runes.\u00a0 If a unicorn is surrounded it will explode into a rainbow, scoring a massive amount of points. \u00a0In the Animal theme pack each animal will make its own amusing noise when placed on the board.</p>\n<p>Based on player demand, other theme packs and rule changing runes will be added in the future, as the game is designed to be modular and extensible.\u00a0 Games typically last up to an hour, and there is an option to save game progress so that it can be continued later.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T05:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c9e900ce1d5d1bed426eefe8850ea0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["nebulousweb"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
