Users can toggle \u201cTimed Deletion\u201d and adjust the slider in order to control how fast the shapes disappear, or toggle it off and delete it on their own. You can swap between drawing and deleting with right click or by clicking a button. There is also a \u201cDelete All\u201d button for faster clearing. The user can change the shape, color, size and also toggle \u201cRandom Rotation\u201d for a unique outcome. You may also zoom in/out with the up/down arrow keys.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T06:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fd/4fdd5612c13c91a0468d955952d75c25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["G-McCarten"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
