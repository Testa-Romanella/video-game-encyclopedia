{"id": 874433, "slug": "dark-nights-2", "name": "Dark Nights", "name_original": "Dark Nights", "description": "<strong>Story</strong><br/><br/>You live in a small, peaceful village. Every day is the same as any other; boring. Right when you wish for something exciting to happen, strange things start to occur, stemming from the nearby forest. If that isn't enough, the locals have begun disappearing. At the same time, you meet four mysterious guys. Will you discover the truth before becoming the next target?<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/>\u2666 4 routes, each with a unique storyline<br/>\u2666 16 possible endings, 4 per storyline<br/>\u2666 At least 10 hours playtime - 60,000 - 70,000 words per storyline. Total 270,608 words<br/>\u2666 8+ side characters, vary per route. <br/>\u2666 60 CG art/20+ cut scenes<br/>\u2666 60 Original background art<br/>\u2666 37 Original soundtracks<br/>\u2666 29 Achievements<br/>\u2666 Opening video<br/>\u2666 Bonus material<br/><br/><strong>Notes</strong><br/><br/>There isn\u2019t an official order, because each route is a puzzle piece of the whole. Although, some routes are more connected than others. Like Zeikun and Sachiro. If you are going to play all routes anyway, I suggest starting off with Zeikun or Sachiro as an introduction to the story. Kurato and Junoru routes are more plot-heavy so I\u2019d do them as last.<br/><br/>If you enjoy keeping hooked on mysteries I suggest this order: Sachiro&gt; Zeikun&gt; Kurato &gt; Junoru. To understand hints given in other routes I suggest this order: Kurato &gt; Zeikun &gt; Sachiro or Junoru.
