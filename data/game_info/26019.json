The game lets players<br />\nbuild a collection of more than 100 fantastical dinosaurs known as<br />\n\u201cvivosaurs.\u201d This new game incorporates elements of discovery, tactics<br />\nand strategy as players try to get the best vivosaurs on their teams to<br />\nbattle it out on the field.</p>\n<p>Players dig for fossils and use the touch screen of the Nintendo DS\u2122<br />\nsystem to hammer, chip, drill and brush away the bits of rock around<br />\nthe fossil. When their efforts result in the buildup of dust, players<br />\nblow into the Nintendo DS microphone to blow the dust away.</p>\n<p>The game rates players on how well they handle the fossils during the<br />\ncleaning process. The more carefully and completely a player cleans a<br />\nfossil, the more powerful the vivosaur will be in battle. Vivosaurs<br />\ncan also gain more power through battles.</p>\n<p>Players must collect various parts of each vivosaur. The head must be<br />\nfound first to bring a vivosaur to life while the body, arms and legs<br />\ncan be added to increase its power on the battlefield and imbue it<br />\nwith special powers.</p>\n<p>The game features an engrossing role-playing storyline and vast<br />\nenvironments for players to explore.</p>\n<p>Players can connect wirelessly with friends to battle or trade their<br />\nfossils.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2009-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T01:33:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2e/c2ef3acb00632f49fb1a93a5656e46f2.jpg", "website": "http://fossilfighters.nintendo.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Nintendo", "ARTDINK", "Red Entertainment", "M2"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
