Gotta catch up, but be careful - these portals look dangerous, and you have no idea where they'll take you, or what they might do to you. Avoid them at all costs... or try to go through all of them - this is your adventure through the abandoned portal factory, experience it however you want!</p>\n<p>The game is played with a single button, which you hold to aim your jump, and release to jump in that direction (for more control mid-air, you can press the button again to double jump, which gives you a little boost and slows you down horizontally).</p>\n<p>This game was created for Global Game Jam 2018 (Transmission).\u00a0The player sprites for this game were created by 24 of the jam's local participants. One person would draw a spritesheet based on the original spritesheet, and then passed (or transmitted) their spritesheet to the next person, who created one based on that.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Hold space bar: Aim jump<br/>Release space bar: Jump<br/>Press space bar mid-air: Double jump<br/>(Any face button on a gamepad or the Z/X/C/V/B/N/M keys can be used instead of space bar)</p>\n<p>Esc: Return to title (Quit if on title)<br/>R: Restart game<br/>A: Toggle antialiasing<br/>F: Toggle fullscreen</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Writing, code, and environmental art by TJ Cordes (me)</p>\n<p>Music by Toby Thompson</p>\n<p>Character art by the following Buffalo Game Space GGJ18 participants:</p>\n<ul><li>TJ C.</li><li>Hussain H.</li><li>Wayne K.</li><li>Arsenio\u00a0C.</li><li>Toby T.</li><li>Mark Z.</li><li>Jayson K.</li><li>Mark M.</li><li>Futch</li><li>Doug</li><li>Anthony S.</li><li>Gregory G.</li><li>Dan S.</li><li>Kendall</li><li>Alana</li><li>Hello CLD</li><li>ThatScrub</li><li>Katherine S.</li><li>Dale S.</li><li>Devon A.</li><li>John D.</li><li>Kevin</li><li>Naltroc</li><li>Shannon Z.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a57/a579aa93becdba3b414a88d1f4987870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kyatt/Impostor Cat Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
