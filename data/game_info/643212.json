CB is a single-player experience for the Oculus quest and quest 2.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theme - I decided to interpret the theme of \"small world\" by putting the player at an average height, but using a large net and a slightly oversized ball. In the larger scope of the game, the island would float around the next adding to the effect, but unfortunately due to time I was unable to add that in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm aware it's not a great game! It's my third ever release and it's very simplistic. minimal programming, mostly just some arrangement of assets. I look forward to expanding on this game in the future, building off of what I have right now.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T02:39:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5ca17120d2cde4a9d5efeb4d5835601.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["SSR07"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
