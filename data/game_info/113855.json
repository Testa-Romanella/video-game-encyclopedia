Also,\u00a0 there is a slim chance you will get several turtles and you can play to stack them.<br/></p>\n<p>ALLERGY INFORMATION: Squirrels were added to remove any trace of nuts.<br/></p>\n<p>==TODO LIST ==<br/>(did not manage to do them, read them just as one of those XKCD devlog comics)<br/>Since updates are allowed, I will continue working during the week.</p>\n<p>* Add detailed charts showing the progression of the important aspects (~time spent with your family~, beard length over time, amount of squirrels alive, etc), perhaps next weekend.<br/>* The family should grow, time spent with your couple leads to kids, that then require you to play with them, etc.<br/>* There should be waaay more antique options, and they should evolve over time (maybe you start with old objects, and end up getting computers, or satellites)<br/>* An autosave would be nice, allowing the addition of a hardcore mode (i.e., no fast forward).<br/>* Allow the use of terminal commands, and perhaps some BASH scripting.<br/>* Have a legacy mode, where your kids can continue your work. Right now you should be happy if they don't leave you for taking your job too seriously.<br/>* I would really like to redraw the sprites.</p>\n<p>==UPDATE LOG==<br/></p>\n<p>25/11/17 - 20:30 : Added a piechart showing the time distribution. Added some small talk events. Refactored the UI layout because it was causing resizing problems.<br/></p>\n<p>22/11/17 - 22:35 : Added some objects, another dialog line, and fixed some small bugs.<br/>22/11/17 - 19:01 : Added an auto-pause button\u00a0to make the game easier to understand (active by default).
