{"id": 700604, "slug": "slime-defense-sown", "name": "Slime Defense (Sown)", "name_original": "Slime Defense (Sown)", "description": "<p>Slime Defense is a turn based strategy game that takes place in a post-slimepocalyptic future. You start in a house with nothing but an axe and an old pistol and must find a way to survive and possibly escape to safety. The game's core loop is around managing your resources while trying to survive for as long as possible, acquiring better weapons and creating temporary or permenant defenses to get by. The game was made in Java using only default libraries and all the art was made in MS Paint, except for making sprites transparent.</p>\n<p>Note: The game\u00a0is incomplete. I made this game a while back and don't plan on completing it now, so there is no ending, but you can still try to survive for as long as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T10:57:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/888/888dfa7e1942dba2c35891a01016b057.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sown"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
