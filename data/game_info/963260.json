The victories of the Tay Son army highlighted the intelligence, bravery and patriotism of the Vietnamese people in a clear way. By participating in the game, players will immerse themselves in the fierce battlefield atmosphere, with fire and smoke from the upheavals of this period.<h3>Gameplay</h3>There are 4 character classes for players to choose from. Each character class uses different skills and weapons, including long swords, glaives, qi skills, and magic. Players can fight in the individual arena or team up with others. Especially, the \"Protect Commander\" game mode promises to create exciting and thrilling situations with the participation of artillery, elephants, kite fire, etc. In addition, our studio also brings into the game many costumes and items that are familiar to the Vietnamese people.
