We love our project, and we want you to love the world that we came up with.<br/>\r\nGame universe:<br/>\r\nBillions of time cycles have passed since the creation of reality. One of many, separate, and related to others. The human mind can not imagine the diversity of universes and worlds that is present in what we call reality.<br/>\r\nNobody knows how and when everything began, and no one knows when the time came.<br/>\r\nTime ... Thing, what holds back the onslaught of an invisible force that destroys the universe, and what itself destroys reality. Long time ago, in the depths of the worlds, the \"original\" time was sealed in a crystal, like the last chance to stop the death of reality. Who did this - a big mystery, but the forgotten time crystal spent billions of time cycles in a sealed form. He saw the death and birth of universes, the collation of worlds and different planes of reality, and so it could go on forever - if not for one \"but\" - the time shell also turned out to be not eternal, and gave a crack that entailed problems.<br/>\r\nIn all universes, something began to leak, the invisible force that in reality learned to take dark shape.<br/>\r\nWorlds in which this power destroyed life, devoured time and reality - disappeared one by one. Disappeared forever, and it was already impossible to bring them back.<br/>\r\nBut not all worlds perished under the onslaught of dark forces - in some universes beings were found creatures of rebuffing them. All these heroes have one thing in common - there is no place for fear in their souls. They all gathered in the House of Time - the place where the same crystal was sealed, after the events in each of the worlds where they were born.<br/>\r\nGame process:<br/>\r\nThe gameplay of our game - is a 2D action with rpg elements in the colorful world.
