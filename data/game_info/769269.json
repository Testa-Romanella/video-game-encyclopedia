All the credits for game design, graphics and music belongs to them. I just try to make a demake of the game on GameBoy via GBStudio\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I will try to transfer as much content of the original game as possible to the GameBoy hardware.\u00a0Due to hardware limitations i will have to make changes to game design and other aspects of the game. At the end it will hopefully a fun game\u00a0that will catch the spirit of the oldschool classic.</p><p>In the near future there will also be a file available to play it on real GameBoy Hardware.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Version alpha V 0.1</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The first published file of Burntime - Pocket Edition</p>\n<p>First of all I implemented the menu system for the game and the ability to travel from town to town. Right now there are only 2 towns visitable but more will be added in the near future. <br/>You can catch up some food, water and other stuff in your inventory.
