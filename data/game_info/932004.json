Created with GB-Studio 2.0.0 beta5!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You are Thomas the cat and you have a date with a lady friend and you must move across the local area to get to her using walls. The game is a side view flick-screen game and you must move across each screen from the left to the right avoiding obstacles like flying boots and bottles. There are also gaps with gates and these must be jumped over but on later screens obstacles appear from the gaps like dogs and brooms. If you touch an obstacle or fall through a gap then you lose a life\u00a0and start on the left of the screen you are on. Reaching the end of each screen gives you a bonus based on how long it took you to complete the screen.\r\n</p>\n<p>Also available for download in .CIA format for the Nintendo 3DS virtual console!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game:</strong> X, Enter<br/><strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Cursor LEFT/RIGHT<br/><strong>Jump:</strong>\u00a0X</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game:</strong>\u00a0B, Start<br/>\n<strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Cursor LEFT/RIGHT<br/><strong>Jump:</strong>\u00a0B<br/><br/>\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Alley Cat - Solar Software\r\n</p>\n<p>Creator (WLS) homepage link\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T13:51:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/641/6412bd8101c3b4ad2c3708bcd81b783a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rajcs\u00e1nyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
