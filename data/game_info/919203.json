{"id": 919203, "slug": "where-the-dead-lie", "name": "Where The Dead Lie", "name_original": "Where The Dead Lie", "description": "<p>Enter into the catacombs and pray that it doesn't catch you!</p>\n<p>- - -<br/></p>\n<p>\"Where The Dead Lie\" is a short horror experience made in roughly a week, with love, by yours truely. I wanted to try something different and this was definitely different. I also tested out game developing with Godot 4's new Vulkan renderer, which I think looks fantastic. I hope it gives you the spooks you want!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You must creep around the catacombs, with only your camera to light your way. You have to get the power systems back online if you want to be freed. But there's something else in there with you. Evade \"The Smeth\" as you get the power up and running again and earn your freedom, or what freedom you can be accommodated.<br/></p>\r\nAccessibility\r\n<ul><li>Flashing Lights (optional)</li><li>Subtitles (voice over only, not-optional)</li></ul>\n<p>For now the only accessibility option is to disable flashing lights. It replaces your camera flash with a flashlight. But the flashlight has a shorter range than the flash of the camera. So there's a tradeoff with using it. If you want me to add any other accessibility features to this game just let me know! I made this game is about a week so I did what I could.</p>\r\nCredits for 3rd Party Assets\r\n<p>More details are available in-game<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Kay Lousberg</li><li>Light Game Studio (OpenGameArt)</li><li>CaptainRipley</li><li>Kenney</li><li>PolyHaven</li><li>Astounded (Freesound)</li></ul>\n<p>The majority of content I made myself, but I supplemented with some extra assets, and made modifications where I saw fit.<br/></p>\r\nPirate Edition???\r\n<p>Yes, there is a \"Pirate Edition\" available. It is a free alternative to buying the game, however it will ask you to purchase the game at some point. I hope this is a friendly compromise with anyone who cannot afford the game. Or who would rather play the game first, and decide what they want to pay for it. Honestly whatever your reason, go for it. Just understand that I will consider it a \"pirated\" version, so don't expect support. I'm paycheck to paycheck right now so anything helps!</p>\r\nMade a video or review of/with this game? I wanna see it!\r\n<p>If you make a \"Let's Play\", formal review, or anything related to this game, I'd love to hear about it! Leave a comment on the game here or message me on any of my socials (I prefer Mastodon). I make games because I want to see people enjoy them and be entertained. So knowing that people are having fun playing my games would warm my heart.</p>\r\nAdvice for repeated play-throughs\r\nSkipping Voice Over\r\n<p>Hitting the \"Enter\" key will automatically skip the current voice over and run to the end of the animation cycle if applicable. This can be used to skip the beginning monologue.</p>\r\nDifficulty with the difficulty?\r\n<p>If you are having a hard time, feel free to change the difficulty settings in the options page. There are no secrets in the game that require a specific difficulty level. So enjoy at whatever difficulty you prefer, whether that be \"Incredibly Easy\" or \"Queen's Challenge\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T16:13:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13c/13cabffd5b166eafab3bac8620dcd095.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["QueenOfSquiggles"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
