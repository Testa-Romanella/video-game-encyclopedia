Special Projectile is a coin bag \"convert shot\" that guarantees to convert if hitting a valid enemy.</li><li><strong>Wizard</strong>: Shoots swerving shots, has insanely high base damage, but can't convert enemies at all. Their secondary is a barrage of flames that can build up for quite a while.</li><li><strong>King</strong>:\u00a0Shoots inaccurate coin-like projectiles.

It's already possible, there simply wasn't enough time.
