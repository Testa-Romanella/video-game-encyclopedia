You can see in your inventory what you have farmed so far. Use your farmed resources to join them together in your crafting table to be able to farm even faster new resources! There are two different biomes to explore. Ascend to increase the dropped resources!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will probably continue the development of the game after the Game Jam and release it for Android. The first version of the game was developed in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2021. I did everything by myself (code, art, animation). There is no Sound or Music since most people don't want this in an idle clicker, and I didn't had enough time for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments what you think about the game and how I can make it better!</p>\n<p>Follow me on social media for more updates on my games:<br/>Facebook<br/>Twitter<br/>Instagram<br/>YouTube<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:25:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5c8384160480472512307d394bc570a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BelindaTesiGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
