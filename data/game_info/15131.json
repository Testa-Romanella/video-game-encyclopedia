We made a Homeworld mod, and kept building from there. Work started on an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, but was then ported over to UT3 in 2007, culminating in a 3rd place grand prize in 2009's MakeSomethingUnreal contest. <br/><br/>Angels Fall First as a standalone game is, for us, a mission to enable the player to do as much as possible in a vast environment - whilst still retaining the focussed, fun experience of match based FPS games. <br/><br/>Way back in the back-whens, we loved Tie Fighter. A little later on, we loved Battlefield. We waited patiently for the game which would inevitably unite the vast scale and spacefights with the close and personal firefights and thunderous vehicle battles... <br/><br/>But it never really appeared. Many games came close, but there was always some part missing. You couldn\u2019t get out of your spaceship, you couldn\u2019t get into your spaceship, you had big spaceships but you couldn\u2019t run around in them, you could run around in your big spaceship but you couldn\u2019t fly it and so on and so forth and gahd damMIT! Where was our spacefight groundfight game?<br/><br/>So, we set ourselves to work. AFF exists because it MUST exist. Only in AFF can you spawn in your crew quarters, run to the bay watching the space fight out of the windows, launch a dropship, fight through the defenders to the enemy flagship, breach the hull, run and gun your way to the bridge and SHOOT THE ENEMY CAPTAIN IN THE BACK OF THE NECK. <br/><br/><strong>Calm Down!</strong><br/><br/>Ok. But it's this slightly twitchy passion which has driven us to create such a monster. We grew old making this, and we got grumpy watching everyone else release their cool games or whatever. We're from a time when games were about blowing stuff up for points and glory and now FINALLY we want to go out there and share this crazy passion with all of you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T17:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/7688ea22896c600db7a9aa9b7010f666.jpg", "website": "http://www.affuniverse.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 86, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 11, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 527, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strangely Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Strangely Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
