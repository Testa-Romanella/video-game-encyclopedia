It has a simple mechanic (was the best I could do within the time frame), but I hope it is fun nonetheless. I was able to include five levels of increasing difficulty. They are intended to teach you how to play without really explaining anything.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The jam's theme is\u00a0<strong>Death Is Not The End</strong>, and thus in this game you have to die and literally walk over your dead body to reach the exit in each level. You control the player character with the arrow keys. While the visual art may not be self explanatory, the levels are designed so you should be able to get the meaning of each element by trial and error.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This time I did all the code and assets (visual and audible) by myself with the exception of the font\u00a0<strong>Xolonium</strong>\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>Severin Meyer</strong>. The game itself was made in\u00a0Godot. Please see the licence files included in the downloadable files and the landing page of the web version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a09b473a7c3aa4f8cb2573eed2fb860b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GreenBeakCrow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
