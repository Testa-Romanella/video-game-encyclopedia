Please give me a day off.</p>\n\n<p>Most of what I used was below but once I got a feel for the coding version of it, I mainly used the referencing on yoyogames website for what functions does what and how to use them.</p>\n\n<p>My twist is that you can spawn turrets to shoot too. There is a bug with this as the turret doesn't choose the closest enemy and instead tries to shoot around the wrap of the screen. Very odd.</p>\n<p>Enjoy</p>\n\n<p>All sound effects, music, font (apart from Ariel)\u00a0and art are mine made specifically for this.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>tutorial series an asteroids:<br/></p>\n\n<p>tutorial series on gamemaker studio your first game\u00a0 - code:<br/>https://www.yoyogames.com/learn</p>\n<p>yoyo games reference:\u00a0<br/>https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/index.html</p>\n<p>How to rotate an image- https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/question-how-to-rotate-an-object.4...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4d/d4d260c6df73acdf58e53b9510ecec1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Just Lewis UP909980"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
