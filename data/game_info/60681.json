Easy to play and hard to master! <br/><br/>Explore the mysterious Dungeons of Cyndaria and unearth an extensive lore. A plethora of creatures and magical items are waiting for you to step into ever-changing dungeons, with diverse biomes and challenges.  <br/><br/>Defeat Dragon bosses to unleash hidden runes and recover the sacred seeds of Cyndaria to restore the divine trees. <br/><br/>Dungeons can be unforgiving: be sure to eat and rest in time, use all your abilities wisely. Nothing stops you from skipping bosses to rush and move to the next dungeon, but you\u2019ll also meet true death if you don\u2019t take time to level up your character and abilities.<br/><br/><br/>Each class has access to 4 rune types and casts spells by drawing them on a runic compass. <br/><br/>Make your character unique, based on your gameplay: do you prefer shooting arrows with your warrior? Just use your bow more often, and your \u201cRanged weapons\u201d specialization will level up, twice faster if you chose the talent \u201cHunter\u201d when rolling your character.<br/><br/>Our game is similar to classic roguelike such as Nethack, enhanced with an extensive interface and an intuitive fast access to melee, ranged or spell casting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Life and mana gradually refill after several turns, but you can choose the faster way by sleeping, which consumes precious food.<br/><br/><br/>Permadeath, turn by turn gameplay, runecast system, hunger, random levels with predetermined land patches on each floor, 200+ equipment pieces to loot, cursed items and enchanted items, extensive inventory system, random potions, scrolls... and so much more to discover!
