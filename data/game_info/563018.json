There is one flag/goal if you want to race for time, a few secret and challenging alternative routes, and a hidden secret!</p>\n<p>In the final version, there will be multiple goals and routes to explore, as well as the infamous route mentioned up above. It will also feature online leaderboards (currently only a locally saved high score table), and map editing/sharing.<br/></p>\n<p> At least, those are my stretch goals, it all depends on what kind of feedback I get and interest, so if you want this game to become even better, please, at the very, tell me you like it so I know someone does! It will mean a lot to me. &lt;3</p>\n<p>Also let me know if you manage to beat my high score!:O</p>\n\n<p>Good luck and have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T13:23:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bd/0bd43ab0498a7f458ef2d6ded8d6f2f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artiknappa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
