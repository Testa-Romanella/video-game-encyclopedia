My goal with the project is to make a fun party game you could play with your friends, and in the process betray and manipulate them to fulfill your goals. It's a game about collecting wood and using that wood for\u00a0<em>purposes.</em> You play as either a traitor or innocent, with the innocents gathering wood to keep the town's hunting camp warm during the winter, and traitors trying to steal that wood so that they can craft shivs and\u00a0commit murders.</p>\n<p>The current build of the game is incomplete, and simply demonstrates some of the concepts\u00a0I had planned.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T04:44:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/302/302c4a80fa179aa32d69be7197c69868.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eva Feathers"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
