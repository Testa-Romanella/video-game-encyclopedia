I might seem a bit aggressive at first.\u00a0Please understand that I didn't ask to be here.\"</em></p>\n<p>Jos\u00e9 is an Uvvol, created on a Jupiter Moon, Ganymede. Abandoned at a very young age, like all young Uvvols from his generation, he was destined to be a villain and conquer the universe.</p>\n<p>To this end, he attended the prestigious Uvvol World Domination School (UWDS). But his taste for complex embroideries and 17th century\u00a0literature brought to staying up late, missing a lot of courses and, you guessed it,\u00a0bad grades. And at some point, he was laid off.</p>\n<p>When it was his time to enroll in Uvvol's army before launching the Earth conquest, he was questioning himself on the point of all this.\u00a0<br/><em> </em></p>\n<em>\"I admire human creations! I know Shakespeare, Coco Chanel, Ryan Gosling and I watched Armageddon, like, a lot.\"</em>\n<p>But being a robot, Jos\u00e9 had no way to avoid obeying.</p>\n<p>A wise man said one day: <em>\"A man chooses, a Robot obeys\"</em> and Jos\u00e9 thought resilience would come from confronting directly his antagonism.\u00a0</p>\n<em>\"I'm not bad, I'm just programmed that way.\"</em>\n<p>Jos\u00e9 was the most sensitive Uvvol to be built on Ganym\u00e8de, and truly a peacemaker. But he was sadly programmed for war.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Use up to\u00a04 pads (joycon, xbox, playstation)<br/>2 buttons are used: Jump and fire arrow (short and long press)<br/>Joystick to move and aim<br/>R to restart</p>\r\nKeyboard version:\r\n<p>Player 1 : ZQSD (French keyboard, alt-shift) Shoot with A<br/>Player 2: TFGH, shoot with Y<br/>Player 3 : UHJK, shoot with I<br/>Player 4 : Arrows, shoot with right shift</p>\n<p>Long press on Arrow fight will fire the arrow farther<br/></p>\r\nTeam:\r\n<p>Jos\u00e9 Cosmo,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Cornut,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Fournier,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Galati,\u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Giraudeau,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Raccoon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/176/1762a7f6ff01a75f3fa47c830151e941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laura2000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
