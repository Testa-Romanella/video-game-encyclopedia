Cars are good on land, boats are good on water, and planes are great all around. There are two different game modes that the player can chose from. The only objective is to destroy as many of the enemy team as possible without running out of respawns. Each team has a certain amount of respawns. When a team reaches zero respawns, they lose.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d0/3d01fed4abe6588847fa3328cf190ad4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Team >Nice"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
