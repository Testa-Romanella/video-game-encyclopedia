{"id": 406149, "slug": "galaxy-fighters-itch", "name": "Galaxy Fighters (itch)", "name_original": "Galaxy Fighters (itch)", "description": "<p>Galaxy Fighter is a fixed shooter game made for Pokitto where the player mans a lone starfighter at the bottom of the screen, which must prevent the enemy forces from destroying all of mankind.\u00a0 The objective of each stage is to defeat all of the aliens, which will fly into formation from the top and sides of the screen. Aliens will dive towards the player while shooting down projectiles; colliding with either projectiles or aliens will result in a life being lost.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The front line of the Galaga army. Bees make up the bottom two rows of the formation at the top of the screen. They will occasionally break from the formation and go on a bombing run, attempting to shoot you or crash in to you. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The Butterflies occupy the two rows above the Bees. They will break from the formation as well to go on bombing runs like the Bees and have a tendency to quickly steer left and right while diving, making them harder to hit. But the very top row of Butterflies will also accompany a Boss Galaga as an escort when the Boss Galaga is not attempting to use a tractor beam on your fighter.</p>\n\n<p>The Boss Fighters resemble birds. Unlike the rest of the army, they must be shot twice in order to be destroyed. The first shot merely changes their color from green to purple. In either color, they will do one of two things. Either they will go on a typical bombing run or they will initiate a tractor beam run. If your fighter is caught in the beam, it will turn red and be captured and brought up to the top of the scree</p>\n<p>Once per stage (beginning with Stage 4), a Bee (or a Butterfly if no Bees exist) will transform into a set of three enemies. The type of enemy that gets created changes every couple of stages. This set of three enemies will dive down, firing at you on the way, and make one final loop before exiting the screen. Unlike Bees, they do not return to the formation from the top. Killing some of them awards you points, but killing all of them awards you a big bonus.</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:26:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c2/4c2969a53246b62132ef3e1296429a96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PressPlayOnTape"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
