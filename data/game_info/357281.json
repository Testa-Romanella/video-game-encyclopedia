Introverted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A child genius, unlike his brother. He was always very serious about his work, at the age of 17 he went straight to Cambridge university to study physics. There he met a japanese transfer student, Katsuko, they made a strong friendship working together on projects in their spare time, along with his teacher, Christopher. Together, the three of them spent their time at cambridge developing a secret prototype time machine. James invited his brother to visit them one day, his brother was killed in a bad car crash, since that day, james became almost obsessed with the time machine, hoping to one day go back and save his brother. James and Katsuko left university together and moved into a small cottage in the countryside. There they set up a lab next to the house and continue to work on their experiments together. A few years after they moved in, their teacher Christophe contacted them about their project and they invited him to continue working on it with them. James got colder towards everyone and began separating himself from the world to work on the time machine. He ignores his daughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mother-\u00a0</p>\n<p>Name: Katsuko (Kat)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nationality: Japanese</p>\n<p>Age: 43</p>\n<p>She is slim and works at the lab. Messy black hair and big glasses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Traits: Energetic, Intelligent, Passionate, Clumsy, Eccentric.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Backstory: She was raised in Japan and attended the Tokyo childrens academy, a school for gifted children. Her parents were supportive of her hobbies and let her study further physics abroad in england, she left Japan in 2005 and went to study at Cambridge. There she met James and they worked together during their time, eventually they fell in love and she ended up pregnant with Tokemi. She and James moved out to the countryside where they raised Tokemi as well as continued work on their projects, including a time machine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lab worker / Teacher</p>\n<p>Name: Christophe</p>\n<p>Age: 70</p>\n<p>Nationality: Swedish</p>\n<p>Occupation:\u00a0 Lab member, works with James on the time machine in his retirement. Used to work at Cern when he , then went to england to teach physics at the university Ashley's parents went to. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Description: Wears brown clothes. Has a grey beard. Always wears a badge from Cern.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Traits: very intelligent,\u00a0 eccentric,\u00a0 cheerful, helpful, illness (from too much exposure to time waves)</p>\n<p>Backstory: Born in Switzerland into a rich family, he spent his childhood in his parents mansion, he was home schooled by the finest teacher his parents could find. He lived an isolated life and didn't have many friends. He spent most of his time in his lab, which his parents paid for. When he was old enough he left the mansion to go and work for the swedish research lab, Cern. He worked there for many years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0After working at Cern he heard that Cambridge in England was looking to hire experts in Physics, he always dreamed of teaching others about his passion, he got the job and moved to the UK, here he met two students who would have a big impact on him, James and Katsuko. They would always be the most involved in lessons, and way beyond the capabilities of the rest of the students. He decided to introduce them to some of his projects he had been working on, including a time machine. The three of them worked on the time machine there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0When Katsuko and James graduated, he decided to let them take the project with them to their new home in the countryside. He decided to take an early retirement a few years later, he went to live near Kat and James and continued work on the time machine project. Dedicating all of his time to working on it, they finally manage to complete it on Tokemi's 20th birthday. He is like a Grandfather to Tokemi who has grown up with him around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Main character</p>\n<p>Ashley (Tokemi) - doesn't like her japanese name.</p>\n<p>Age: 20 years old.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nationality: English/Japanese</p>\n<p>Occupation: student\u00a0</p>\n<p>Description: Punk style multicoloured hair.

She doesn't see her father very often and doesn't really have much interest in learning about physics and maths. She is not allowed near the lab where her parents often work for days on end. She is left alone in the house. On her 20th birthday, her father lets her into the Lab to see the time machine. Later that day she sneaks in while he is sleeping and uses the machine to go back in time to find out how her parents met.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T04:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb1/fb1d2058d33710d5b0e13e26f1a25c03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PARADYME", "RetroBreak"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": ["PARADYME"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
