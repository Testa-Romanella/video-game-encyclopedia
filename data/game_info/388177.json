You have to play them one (or more) beat(s) after him, while he's playing! This results in a musical canon and an incredibly exhausting rhythm game! Something for players to agonize upon but TAS bots to cherish.</p>\n\n<p>Made by 89o, menu music made by Daen.</p>\n<p>Made for ScoreSpace/Polycade Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T06:55:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8d/e8d1f3149c662ac7d2452451c595c195.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["89o"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
