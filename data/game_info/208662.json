We all wanted to be happy and excited for this new adventure, but could not.</p>\n<p>In this game I try to convey some of the emotions I experienced while leaving home -- anxiety, nostalgia, and sadness -- all with as little as possible. No music, no animations, and only very simple shapes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is controlled entirely with the arrow keys or WASD. You can press R at any time to restart or Q to quit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54d/54daa3ab541a6117229608753ad725db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Amber"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
