It was initially a practicing demo for learning lua and PICO-8 development, so simple that you can not do anything other than\u00a0move a cube. Then my friend told me that maybe I can add some random walls (it becomes bullet in the end), if the cube touches the wall, the game is over. I thought it was a good idea, so just tried to make it out.</p>\n<p>The whole process is full of fun and thinking, took me about 10 hours to get all the things done, including reading lua &amp; PICO-8 docs, coding, drawing, debugging. One thing worth metioning is that I got huge influence and encouragement from people's reaction to this tweet:\u00a0https://twitter.com/novoreorx/status/999974039681622017\u00a0, many people came to say hi and retweet, event it's just a piece of poor\u00a0newbie code. Thanks to everyone who\u00a0paid attention to it.</p>\n<p>Currently this project, even very small and simple, is far from completed. Here are some tasks I plan to do later:</p>\n<ul><li>[ ] add flying heart (add life, max 5, more become score)</li><li>[ ] add flying bonus (add score)</li><li>[ ] add flying clock (reduce heat)</li><li>[ ] add heat bar (heat increases over time, the greater heat, the more bullets)</li><li>[ ] add dying animation</li><li>[ ] prettify game over, add option for restart</li></ul>\n<p>Glory to PICO-8 and indie game developement. \ud83d\ude18</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e18/e183847f7a75b108aa3ccd26afda1fa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Reorx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
