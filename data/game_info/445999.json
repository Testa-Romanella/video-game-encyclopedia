I had bigger plans for this project but time prevented me from doing so. There was supposed to be an entire map with objectives and locked rooms, puzzles, etc. I am hoping to gain feedback on what people think and features they would like implemented into a full game. The graphics are not great, but that would be greatly improved as I have time to make it look better.\u00a0 If you want to support my endeavors, please donate any amount you want.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T04:33:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bea/bea811e2238bc02bcf0b224b4a2c1aca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nemesis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
