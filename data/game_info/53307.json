Upon further investigation, Tetsuo finds out that the village has been having strange happenings ever since the old temple became overrun with demons. When he returns to the village after talking to the old guardian of the Temple, the village has been attacked, supposedly, as one of the dying villagers says, by &quot;...ravens...&quot; Also, it seems as if all the children have vanished as well.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2003-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-24T12:12:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c2/9c2cad521fc7c589eda22054bff3157a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 361, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Naps Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["ZOO Digital Publishing", "DSI Games", "Zushi Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
