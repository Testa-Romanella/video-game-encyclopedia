This story is told in the AddOn - \"The Desert\". Around it, there are many new areas to explore and to learn about their laws.<br/>Like the main game, the AddOn is a friendly game in which you can feel at ease. There is no pointless grinding and the entire world is handmade and there is something to discover everywhere.<br/>The game combines nature simulation, which has been expanded even further, with farm building, role-playing with an exciting story and varying battles, in the hand-created dungeons, catacombs and caves.<br/>Many new interesting items with their own mechanics such as a food dispenser, a hayrack, or the new growth crystals offer new possibilities.<br/>The monsters have also gained in finesse and complexity and should now provide even more diversity in the battles.<br/>As usual, the new NPCs have their own thoughts, worries and tasks and offer many insights into their lives with the master during your stay in the desert.<br/>You will also meet numerous friends from the main game again and relationships will be deepened and new tasks mastered together. The love story around Aleena and Cailan is also continued.<br/>Much has also changed in the world. The nature simulation has been enriched by active volcanoes and many small improvements.<br/>The add-on takes place directly after the main game and therefore requires that you have completed the story there. The difficulty level is similar to the main game. As usual, there is a mix of farming, role-playing and exploring, although survival elements are also added, especially at the beginning in the life-hostile desert.<br/><br/>You can read about all the new features in the patch notes for the add-on or in the in-game instructions (F1 in the game).</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T03:01:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32e/32ef6fc5df9006ef2ce4b8095092cc23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jadawin1"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
