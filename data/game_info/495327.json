I understand that many of you have come here seeking an answer to the ultimate question of life; how can I prevent myself from feeling bored today? Well, if I may take just 10 minutes of your time I would like for you to be a test subject of my newest experiment. You see, my purpose is to give you a purpose which is why I will be referring to you as subject 243.\u00a0You will be placed into a single room with only one entrance and exit. I will then come in and give you a series of instructions that I expect you to follow. If everything goes according to plan then at end of the experiment, I will let you go. Be aware though, looks can be deceiving and the room may not be as simple as it appears to be. I know this might sound dangerous but I assure you, we've done extensive testing and very few have died in the process.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of this experiment?\r\n  \r\n<p>Personally, I don\u2019t like words such as purpose or reason but just know that there is one even if it\u2019s not immediately apparent. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a very trustworthy person even when I\u2019m lying. Of course, you\u2019re expected to treat this experiment with the seriousness it deserves so just let loose and go with the flow.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nBut this is just a demo.\r\n  \r\n<p>Of course, the full experiment isn\u2019t ready yet, just a brief demonstration. It may be short but I assure you, there will be much more coming your way. Of course, this is a rather early version of the experiment so you might run into problems. If you do then please send\u00a0an electronic letter to the individual listed on this\u00a0electronic mail address.   </p>\n<p>BrandonMacleodGames@gmail.com\r\n  </p>\n<p>For more information, you can find updates on this Twitter thing (look, I don't know much about how these things work but if you follow the link, the individual who runs it will answer any questions you might have).</p><p>Twitter</p>\n<p>And who could forget a YouTube channel thingy (whatever that is).</p><p>YouTube Channel</p>\n\r\nAlright, let\u2019s begin.\r\n  \r\n<p>Clear your mind and be prepared for anything. If you're ready then let's begin.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<p>Created By: Me\r\n  </p>\n<p>Special Thanks: Two books and a shoebox</p><p>Email</p><p>Twitter</p><p>YouTube</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59c/59ca7bc80bb87f0d10329648ef3e112f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandon Macleod"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
