Create a fully-fledged level 2 &amp; 3. Each will have unique designs and enemy spawn points.</p>\n<p>2. Ship powerups: a multi-shot powerup (shoot three at once) or a speed boost powerup, or both.</p>\n<p>3. Design a new enemy and give it custom movements and firing patterns.</p>\n<p>4. Potentially create my own music for the game, I will assess if this will be possible when I try it. It sounds fun though.</p>\n<p>Created by Soren Gerlach</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T09:58:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/4317dbcbcf4a9ed64de428fcc47b0ac2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gerlac32"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
