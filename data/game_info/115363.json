When you touch and slide your finger on a turret to your target, it turns on and fires continuously until you give it a new order.<br/>\r\n\tRandomly, a killed enemy drops a item of energy that can be used to recharge the battery from the laser turret. When the battery is loaded, a sound will warn you that it is operational.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Who am I?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI'm an independent developer, Wahid Garci A.K.A.
