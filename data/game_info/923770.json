The player controls the paddle, which moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen, and must use it to keep the ball in play and prevent it from falling off the screen. The ball bounces off the blocks, breaking them upon impact, and the player must strategically aim the ball to hit all the blocks and clear the level. The Breakout is a fun and addictive game that tests the player's reflexes and hand-eye coordination.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<strong>\n<p><strong>\n<br/>\n</strong></p>\n</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T09:57:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fc/6fc5139f0275acdaf86e36653bcd009b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BenLev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
