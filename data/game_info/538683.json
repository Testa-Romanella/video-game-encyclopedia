Find different strategies for the levels. Except for level #2, just time a jump while moving right after sliding down the platform slowly.<br/></p>\n<p>Completion jam submission. You play as a circle, you move by rolling. This has drawbacks like not being able to change your speed or direction in the air. You're trapped in a world of better moving squares, with impassable traps. Luckily, you can switch over to your own world at will... kind of... and only for a second. Your position is the same across both worlds, both worlds having different layouts, allowing to do otherwise impossible tasks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T05:41:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6d46e027270a48862b56818dd03b600.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Couchlyntt"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
