Once again, Fireproof Games have re-built, re-textured and re-lit every asset and environment to bring the mysterious world of The Room to life.<br />\nIn The Room Three you find yourself lured to a remote island, where you must draw upon all your puzzle-solving ability to navigate a series of trials devised by a mysterious figure known only as \u201cThe Craftsman\u201d.<br />\nFireproof Games are a small independent team working in Guildford in the UK. We self-published our first game The Room on iPad in September 2012 and were stunned with both the critical success and our new-found fan-base, not to mention multiple international awards. The Room games have since changed our lives and we hope you enjoy playing them as much as we enjoyed making them.</p>", "metacritic": 90, "released": "2015-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T21:42:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d0019048c722dee6e4f8dbd4e6b1914.jpeg", "website": "http://www.fireproofgames.com/games/the-room-three", "rating": 4.32, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 43, "owned": 644, "beaten": 181, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 13, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 158, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 161, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Fireproof Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Fireproof Games", "Fireproof Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
