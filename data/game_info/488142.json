{"id": 488142, "slug": "chess-with-a-twist", "name": "Chess With A Twist", "name_original": "Chess With A Twist", "description": "<p>This is my first game called \"Chess With A Twist\". It is a local 2-player game.\u00a0As the name suggests it's a game like chess but there is a twist - you can move and attack separately. Before you continue though, you might want to read your objective in the game and how each chess piece plays.</p>\n<p>Objective: Kill the king of the other team. To kill it you need to attack it three times.</p>\n<p>Rules: In this game in one turn you can do two things - either you can move two pieces or move and attack with one piece - it's all up to you. To perform an action you need to click on the desired piece and enter an action state.</p>\n<p>There are a few states:<br/></p>\n<p>None - the piece doesn't do anything.</p>\n<p>Move - you select the tile where you want to move the piece to.</p>\n<p>Attack - you select the piece you want to attack.</p>\n<p>Teleport (Queen's exclusive) - you select one of the pieces of the same team with which you want to swap places.</p>\n<p>Defend (King's exclusive) - you pick at most three tiles you want to defend for one turn. The defended tiles are unavailable for moving.</p>\n\n<p>Chess pieces:</p>\n<p>Pawn - can move 1-2 tiles to the left, forward or right; can attack 1 tile to the left, forward or right.</p>\n<p>Rook - can move in all four directions; can attack 1-2 tiles to the left, forward, right, backward and 1 tile for all diagonals.</p>\n<p>Knight - can move 2 tiles to the left, forward, right and backward; can attack all tiles around itself. The knight is the only piece that can jump over other pieces and when it does so it stuns the skipped piece (as long as it is on the\u00a0opponent's team). The stunned piece can't do anything in the next turn.</p>\n<p>Bishop - can move in all diagonal directions; can attack 1 tile to the left, forward, right, backward and 1-2 tiles diagonally.</p>\n<p>Queen - has the Rook and Bishop's movement and attack combined; can also teleport.</p>\n<p>King - can move to all tiles around itself; doesn't attack; instead it defends but keep in mind that once you defend you would be able to defend again after 2 turns.</p>\n\n<p>Note: the amount of chess pieces and their arrangement is different from the standard chess.</p>\n<p>And this is all you need to know about this game's gameplay. Keep in mind that this is my first game I have ever made, so don't expect a lot from it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T03:16:44", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ItchYoBoi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
