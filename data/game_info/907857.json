Having more money wouldn't fix the underlying issue that I don't have the necessary expertise and experience (and mental health) to lead development on a funded, fully featured, large-scale game yet. I'm literally just one guy, making games in the rare time I have off from university!!</p>\n<p>But!! If you liked this game and want to support me there are still things you can do!\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Spread the word! </strong>Share this game with your friends and people you think would like it!\r\n</li><li>Show off the game on Twitch or YouTube! (I'd love to see your reactions to it)</li></ul>\n<p>Additionally if you think you'd be able to help development of the game please get in touch. I can't guarantee anything will come of this, but it feels like a good idea to get some kind of network of developers going incase some opportunity arises in the future.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li><strong>Practically everything: </strong>Alzter (me!!!!!)\r\n</li><li><strong>Losing sleep:\u00a0</strong>Also me<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Music: </strong>Alzter and ThisGreenDingo (thank you dingo!!!!!)</li><li><strong>Music Inspiration: </strong>Zhaytee (Joseph Toscano) (his soundtracks for Pingus and Tux Racer are such a vibe)\r\n</li><li>kangaroovindaloo\u00a0- Their\u00a0Desert Ambience Sounds were used in the tutorial level's music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T07:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bc/7bcc01453a74af77d6b5b952509d2240.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Alzter"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
