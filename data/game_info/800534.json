Survive the waves of bullets, casual difficulty by bullet hell standards.</p>\n<p>Objectives: Try to survive the waves of bullets. Only the heart can be damaged.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: I\u00a0couldn't get the mouse/touch screen working the same as the other inputs, so I\u00a0made the speed unbounded. In other words, you can move ridiculously fast with mouse/touch screen, making the game easier.</p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard: WASD, or Arrow Keys</li><li>Controller: D-Pad, or Left Analog Stick</li><li>Mouse: Click and hold anywhere on the screen to move</li><li>Touch Screen: Tap and hold anywhere on the screen to move</li></ul><p>Known Bugs:\u00a0</p><ul><li>Intro Screen:\u00a0Since the mouse/touch controls have unlimited speed, you can go fast enough to clip through things.
