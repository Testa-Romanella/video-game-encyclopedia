There are over 50 unique pieces to collect in the game, with more to come!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are more rules and ways to win, including an additional row on the board behind your setup called your <strong>reserve</strong>: You can put extra pieces in it to bring into the battle later.  There are also <strong>tokens</strong>, a new type of piece that grants you abilities or changes the rules of the game without being on the board.  Units have several unique abilities that make the game play much differently from traditional chess.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The rules of the game change depending on which tokens you pick for your army.  Start with a whole extra row of pawns, create a knight at a weak point in your opponent's defense, or change the win condition to include capturing all of the opponent's minions.<br/><br/>Favor Chess retains chess-like design, and there are no hidden pieces or random elements inside matches.<br/><br/><strong>Other Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Ranked ELO-based ladder system with leaderboards<br/></li><li>Daily challenge positions<br/></li><li>Private game lobbies with rules options<br/></li><li>Ai skirmish mode<br/></li><li>Daily Quests for rewards<br/></li><li>In-Game tutorial<br/></li><li>Beginner-Friendly interface options</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69b/69b31f4b8f669920b9c488494d9ebcd7.jpg", "website": "http://javissoft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Javissoft"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Javissoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
