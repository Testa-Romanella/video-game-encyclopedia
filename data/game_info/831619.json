In Die of the Air, you play as Anton who just feels like in the mood to jump in a few die holes for today. Being attached to a die has some perks and disadvantages\u00a0\u00a0to it though. When in the air, your die rolls incrementing the die number by 1. Certain gates will kill if you don't have the right number and die hole he wants to go through requires your die to be a certain number.\u00a0 (Also it's meant to be hard though it is possible)</p>\n<p>This game was part of a challenge I did against a friend. The idea is just basically GMTK Game Jam 2022. The only difference was that unlike our submission to the jam, we didn't do it together. Slots of Dice is my other friend's game for the challenge which is posted in my itch.io account.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys or WASD to Move</p>\n<p>Z, J or Alt to Jump or Confirm</p>\n<p>X, K or Ctrl to Interact or Confirm</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming and Art by Takago</p>\n<p>Background Assets by GumpyFunction (gumpyfunction.itch.io)</p>\n<p>Music by DeerTears and krumel</p>\n<p>Font by Jeremy Oduber</p>\n<p>Grapefruit Palette\u00a0by GrafxKid</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T17:58:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/139c00ff6a72d6fed79b652484ab7563.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
