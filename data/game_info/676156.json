It also has a volume edit by using the -/+ buttons and a notification that if you buy something, it reminds you to equip it via the pause menu.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Original\u00a0 one is included without all this just in\u00a0 case you want to play the game strictly as it was done in the 72 hours.</em></p>CONTROLS: (Can be edited in game.) Arrows = Move A = Jump S = Shoot D = Dash (when you have an item equipped that allows to dash.) ENTER = Pause menu, where you can equip items and check the map.<p>Six gems to find. Once you collect a gem, the area becomes unstable and you need to find one of the exit portals quick! (You can also use the exit portal at any time to leave the area.)\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the credits to buy stuff in the shop.\r\n</p>\n<p>Items you equip will alter the temperate your mech produces, too much heat and your lil\u2019 robot becomes unstable and will explode after a while! Other things causes heat damage so be careful! You can always de-equip items to lower robot\u2019s temp if needed.\r\n</p>\n<p>Will post something better when I got some sleep. (Need nap now.) -Joel!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T12:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b74d2d62086b15f760638456cf1daa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SinclairStrange"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
