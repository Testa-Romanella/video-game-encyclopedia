A perfect balance of speed and patience is required as you aim to blast as many dots as possible, while ensuring the moving laser cannons have at least one target between them before firing!<br/><br/>The game starts with a single large static dot. When shot it splits into two smaller dots and these begin to move randomly around the gameplay area. Every time a dot gets blasted by your laser cannons it again splits in two, creating an increasing number of smaller and smaller dots. Be patient and be precise, as the first time you shoot your lasers but fail to hit any dots... game over!<br/><br/> - Addictive and challenging gameplay<br/> - Bonus scores when multiple dots (combo\u2019s) are zapped<br/> - Full Game Center integration<br/> - Challenge friends to beat your high score", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T02:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08de65bc27d4493d3309bba7b1455e7f.jpg", "website": "http://oval.fi", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Oval Software Oy"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Oval Software Oy"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
