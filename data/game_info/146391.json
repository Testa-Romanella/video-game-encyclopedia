Every refill counts! If you miss more than 3 glasses an alarm will sound. This means the Zombie bar owner is not happy and he will start chasing you.<br/>The only way to get rid of him is to continuously refill the glasses which turns off the alarm. Shooting zombies will give you extra points that are added to your score in the online leaderboard.<br/>You can become a zombie killer not only with your shotgun but also with randomly spawned power-ups that let you run over zombies by driving different vehicles.<br/>Power-ups are free of charge, but some can make you weaker and easier to catch.</p><p><strong>How To Play:</strong><br/>Swipe up: Jump<br/>Swipe down: Slide<br/>Swipe down (in air): Fill drinks <br/>Swipe right: Shoot</p><p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p><p>\u2605 Retro cartoon graphics<br/>\u2605 Power-ups<br/>\u2605 Online leaderboard<br/>\u2605 Zombies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/936/936fd7430c4a2f2f21ab48439d1553ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["pieceofbreadgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
