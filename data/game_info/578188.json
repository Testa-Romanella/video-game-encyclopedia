This is a classic Shoot'em up mixed with Shooter on Rails mechanics!<br/>We challenge you to dodge all the shots and destroy all the enemies!<br/><br/><br/><br/>On Sniper Ships you will face enemies' waves by moving your ship using the keyboard (ASDW) and aiming your sniper with the mouse (or two analogs if you use a game controller). Your sniper is way stronger than your common ship bullets and also destroys most enemy's bullets, but can you move, aim and shoot fast enough?!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You will face 3 differents waves and bosses.<br/>Be prepared for the many attack patterns and for the bullet hell.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It'll be hard to finish the game, but it'll be even harder to see your friends with a better score than you, so fight for the highscore and throw it in your friends faces.<br/>Keep in mind that you can boost your score if you finish the waves in less time, kill all enemies and avoid being shot.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Leaderboard: Fight for the highscore. (Steam Integration)<br/></li><li> Achievements: 26 achievements to conquer. (Steam Integration)<br/></li><li> Nostalgic Bosses: 3 tough bosses with pattern-based attacks like the classics.<br/></li><li> Straight to Action: No running around with lots of texts or customizations that take hours. Just enjoy a single-player campaign full of action and challenge!<br/></li><li> Partial Controller Support: You can use a controller during to play, but the pause menu needs a mouse. (It might be too difficult on the controller though)<br/></li><li> Steam Cloud Integration</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T02:50:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e7/1e786dde8deb90b74a1ce89343abf273.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sensen Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sensen Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
