It requires a VR Headset. You can't pick up the sword I made in the 3rd scene, sadly, but I'll try and fix it. Also, in the second scene, you'll appear in the wall, but that's an easy fix. I'll fix it after I turn it in, and then update it. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab9/ab95a5ec885314c135dae17519b02314.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mbaker31"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
