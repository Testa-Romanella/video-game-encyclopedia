With a crush on the beautiful sausage dog, will our bellhop help or hinder her duck boyfriend?</p>\n<p>An interactive story made with fungus in unity.</p><p>This game was inspired by a singular picture and I designed the whole game from the inspiration of that image:\u00a0https://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/lundsfryd/bellhop\u00a0. I very much took this image loosely and designed something that was more of my style, it was my springboard to create a random animal love story with Bobbie the bellhop at the centre of it!\u00a0The original concept was just for the interactions between residents and the bellhop, but I later included a romance story to make the game have more flow and structure.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Whilst this game was one of my first looks into branching narratives, I would like to expand the game to have even more ending possibilities with more characters and different consequences. As I learn this new programme further, I would like to add variables to change the consequences of the game and expand Uplifting's current\u00a03 major branch structures!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T20:07:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/033/0336ad116bcb5bd66a3b6d94bed2ccbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["georgieF"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
