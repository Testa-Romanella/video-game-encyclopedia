It\u00a0was a lot of fun to work on; I hope you enjoy :)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay: </strong>It's pretty much a top down shooter, but the length of your arms determines your range. You grow arms, up to a certain size and amount, when near radiation. You also gain and lose eyes which increase or decrease your vision. Radiation can also cause lumps to form, grow, and burst. Having lumps decreases your movement speed but they deal damage when they burst. Iodine pills restore heath and can be dropped by an enemy or found around the map.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD or ARROWS to move<br/>\u00a0</li><li>Left Click to \"punch\" (i use that term very loosely lol) in the direction of the mouse.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>&lt;im still working on making this page look nice&gt;</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T02:54:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f3ac7a6027939bb93199c924e4478a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MuchosWaffles"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
