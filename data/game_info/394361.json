From giant Redwoods to air-cleaning Ginkos, trees are the planets\u2019 faithful protectors. Such a momentous job cannot be undertaken alone, so every tree is helped on its long journey by rootlings, forest spirits who guide trees\u2019 sightless roots \u00a0past hidden dangers to life-giving water deep below the Earth. In recent years however, climate change has made that journey more and more difficult. To protect Earth\u2019s trees, the rootlings now have to overcome countless difficulties. Rootlings is a multiplayer co-op game where two players take on the task of forest spirits and work together to make sure their tree grows healthy and strong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Players control the rootlings using WASD and the arrow keys respectively. Moving the mouse spins the camera around the puzzle and pressing the space bar resets the puzzle to the beginning.<br/></p>\n<p>Team name:\u00a0Forty Two Studios</p>\n<p>Solo developer: Peter Bradley (taranwanderer2@gmail.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T05:41:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ed/0edad79483ca9745eddb80fad11971d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Forty Two Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
