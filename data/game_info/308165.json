He often works overtime. He is not satisfied with ordinary life, working hard, and striving for a more exciting life.<br/><br/>On May 20th, Li Xiyu got off work late this day. He stood up slowly from the work station as usual, and his hands raised his head and stretched out. I took a look at the watch, it was already 23:00, and the window was still busy and the neon flashed. He must catch the last subway at 23:30.<br/><br/>The subway usually digs 20 meters down, but the line 10 where Li Xiyu sits will pass through the station with a depth of 38 meters, because this station will pass through the other two subway lines, and the depth of the following will be deeper.<br/><br/>He rushed out of the company, hurriedly greeted the security guard, came to the subway entrance next to the road, sighed, can catch up, he did not want to wait at the roadside. There was no one in the subway station. The security guards in the empty hall were particularly conspicuous. He quickly pressed the button and brushed the ic card bound to the watch and entered the waiting hall.<br/><br/>He just felt very strange when he walked to the waiting room. Because there are not many people waiting at this time, but there is no one at all, but it doesn't matter. The exhaustion is numb. This was the roar of the subway. Soon the train stopped in front of him, the screen door opened, and Li Xia paused, because the car was empty, which made him unable to name the fear. Hesitated for a short time, still have to go home, Li Xiyu took the courage to step on the train.<br/><br/>The carriage is not empty, but there is no one in the compartment where Li Xihao got on the bus. Sitting in the far side of the car is a young man. Li Xiyu comforted himself. He said: This is not to scare yourself. Isn't there anyone? Maybe this is a shuttle car today. Even so, Li Xizhen still did not dare to stay in the empty carriage, he went to the carriage where the man was. He originally wanted to sit down in the young man's compartment. I didn't expect to just enter the compartment, the young man immediately said to him, please sit down. This is really scaring Li Xiyi, this is too strange, but the person looks very friendly, maybe he is also afraid, then sit down.<br/><br/>Li Xizhen sat next to the young man. It didn't take long before he sat down. The light in front of his eyes became very glaring, and it was almost impossible to see any objects in front. After about 5 minutes, the line of sight gradually became clear. Everything in front of me was incredible, pink, and Li Xiu fixed his eyes and confirmed that he had no dreams. It was indeed a pink tree, the leaves were pink, and they were in the subway car, the leaves were flying, the carriages The lights are completely pink. Li Xizhen can't believe everything in front of him. There are so many strange things happening today. Is it too ordinary to be ordinary, is it crazy? What about the person just now? The entire carriage, except this tree, has no life. He thought, struggling to stand up and take the courage to look at the tree carefully. Behind the foliage, there is a metal ball that floats in the air. So far, Li Xiyu has been eccentric, which is nothing compared to the growth of a pink tree in the carriage. He walked over and tried to pick up the ball with his hand. At this time, the metal ball suddenly spun up and a syringe fell out from the inside of the sphere. He did not read it correctly. It was indeed a syringe. Li Xiyu took it up and looked carefully. Tube, glass outer wall, and thick red blood inside. The small label on the needle label reads: V008 prototype Jinping underground experimental file number G062 powerful hallucinogen recovery serum. Li Xi suddenly realized that he had recruited himself, a hallucinogen, and it was no wonder that he saw so many strange mirrors. He didn't care so much, picked up the syringe and tied it to his arm and pushed in a whole tube of serum.<br/><br/>There was another white light in front of me, and the car was empty again, nothing. Li Xizhen stabilized her emotions and sat down in her chair. She didn't know what she had experienced. Probably after a little while, the car arrived, Li Xiyu quickly got off the bus, but something even strange happened. This station is still the station where he got on the bus. He got off the bus at the station where he got on the bus. It\u2019s just a crash, isn\u2019t it a shot? Not an illusion? This is another train that slowly enters the station. He has not dared to believe everything in front of him. Is it the last bus? How come you drive again.
