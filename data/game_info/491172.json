Your lobby is entirely customizable with items you can pick up or purchase as you progress in the world!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo complete levels, you will need to work together, but you should always keep an eye on the precious Gems scattered on your way. Don't get too greedy though, any mistake might make your whole team lose resources!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLevels are available for either 2 (currently) or 4 players (in the future), through either random matchmaking or inviting your Steam friends.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T00:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f4/8f4553afa86b53ccb33d7be695cbfd66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adrien Pierret"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Adrien Pierret"], "esrb_rating": null}
