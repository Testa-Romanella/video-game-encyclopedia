This game isn't just a time loop of the same day on repeat, this game lets you travel between five different days.  Use your knowledge of the future and ability to travel to the past to assassinate a heavily defended king.  Stealthily eliminate guards without getting caught.  Any NPC can be killed, either to silence a would-be witness, or for more nefarious purposes.  <br/><br/>You play as an assassin beginning his first mission for the Order of Chronos, an order of time manipulating assassins.  Use your ability to freely switch between five days to eliminate the king's guards and court officers so that you can deliver the final blow and steal his signet ring, in order to blackmail him.<h3>Exploration and Puzzles</h3>Explore a town full of unique characters with their own goals and quests.  Learn about events that will happen, and then go back in time to prevent or benefit from them.  <br/><br/>This game is full of non-linear puzzles that will require you to think of time as a key component to solving them.  With no arbitrary limits on your ability to time travel, puzzles can be solved in multiple ways depending on what solution you think of.<h3>Choose your path</h3>Will you slaughter your way through innocents to remove witnesses, or will you only kill the king's guards and be the savior of the village?  5 Days offers different routes to victory that allow for more or less violence.   But be warned, your score at the end will reflect whether you chose creative solutions or brute force.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T03:58:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/587/587c74947855f25e6c522d04bf53944d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inspiring Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Inspiring Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
