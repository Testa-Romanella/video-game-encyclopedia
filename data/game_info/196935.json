We have just moved to berlin (like 8 months ago). I program in my free time and dont use the popular programing language Unity. Instead i use Scratch (download here: www.scratch.mit.edu and click the yellow person) which is much easier to use, and you can only make 2D games. But i like scratch. If i have spellt something wrong it is because in swedish.
