{"id": 970715, "slug": "into-the-valley-2", "name": "Into The Valley", "name_original": "Into The Valley", "description": "A single player third person detective adventure RPG set in Egypt at the time of the building of the pyramids. While the game is primarily a quest game in which you have to follow clues you get from conversations to find your daughter who has been kidnapped by slave traders, it does contain elements of combat and exploration.\r\n\r\nExplore 40 valleys, with 120 unique characters, some friendly and some hostile. Friendly characters will give you advice and clues, as well as helping you with food, weapons and supplies, sometimes for a price. The enemies will include hostile tribesmen, slave traders and the Egyptian soldiers. Angering some friendly characters may turn them into enemies as well. In the beginning of the game enemies will outclass you and kill you easily, so you have to arm yourself with decent equipment before taking on seasoned fighters.\r\n\r\nThere are 16 types of animals, and while the herbivores like zebra and giraffe will run from you, there are meat eaters like lions, hyenas, crocodiles and leopards that would like to eat you. Even some of the herbivores like elephants, rhino and hippos can do you serious harm if you trespass on their territory and they feel threatened.\r\n\r\nYou will need water and three types of food to survive, but you will also need to look after your happiness. Killing innocent people or losing a family member will lower your happiness, and if you become seriously unhappy you may just commit suicide. \r\n\r\nThe game does feature combat and exploration, but the primary aim of the game is to be a primitive detective and to rescue your daughter.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T19:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/9929913d1893eca466196376f040447d.jpg", "website": "http://onelittleserf.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One Little Serf"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["One Little Serf"], "esrb_rating": null}
