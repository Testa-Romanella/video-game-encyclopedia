(Twin-stick Shooter Style)<br/><br/>You're a marine that just latched onto a ship that went radio silent for 20 years after entering a wormhole in space. Battle hordes of aliens, upgrade your arsenal, and collect audio logs to discover the chilling history of the ship you've boarded. This game is as combat driven as it is story driven. You'll feel like you're playing through a nostalgic noir space thriller you've never heard of before as the rich story elements take you on a journey.<br/><br/>Start off with your basic Assault class and unlock other classes as you defeat the various bosses you face.<br/><br/><strong>Choose Abilities As You Level Up</strong><br/>Ability crates spawn randomly on your runs and give you powerful Abilities that you only retain for that current run. These abilities have their own strengths and weaknesses and you'll be able to experiment with them a good bit as they spawn pretty frequently. You may feel a bit weak at first but if you survive long enough the tables will turn in your favor.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Upgrade Your Stats</strong><br/>Completing objectives and destroying crates on your runs will net you Credits to spend at the Upgrade Station. These Upgrades are permanent and will give you a great advantage on future runs.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Complete Objectives For More Credits</strong><br/>When you load into a level 1 of 2 possible objectives will spawn, giving you the opportunity to earn way more credits than just destroying the various crates that spawn.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Survive Hoards of Aliens</strong><br/>Aliens of all types spawn randomly during each run, once you kill them you pick up the Experience Crystals they drop to level up. Their health and damage increase based off the player's level so it's important to choose your bonus stats carefully when you level up! Bosses drop Audio Logs that you can listen to at the Audio Log Station in the Main Hub to hear the chilling history of the ship you've boarded.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T04:37:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/105/1053b769d786bfb353aa0eb953024db9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Struggle Bus Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Struggle Bus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
