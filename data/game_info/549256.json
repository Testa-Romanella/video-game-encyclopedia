This is a visual novel game where you, the player, are going to this caf\u00e9 that you heard about by some means. And you're all set and ready to go on your first meeting with your host: Darkiplier. It's almost like a Tamagotchi\u00a0kind of game so, have fun with it! Mess around and see what easter eggs you can snag up, haha</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned in the game, this is a project that I did to do the following:</p>\n<p>To help raise awareness for a friend\u2019s circumstance (My friend is currently\u00a0struggling to get funds and could really use all the help they could get. Even if you cannot donate personally, I\u00a0would appreciate it if you could circulate the game so that the word is spread!!! You can find them here:</p>\n<p>instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/strigidaemon/\u00a0</p>\n<p>ko-fi:\u00a0https://ko-fi.com/strigidaemon</p>\n<p>Practice programming ( I am in the middle of making another game, similar in what it is but not in content, though it is based off the egos. More can be found here:\u00a0https://www.quotev.com/story/13425457/Untitled-Game-Progress-Book)</p>\n<p>Practice drawing (I am not the greatest at drawing expressions and keeping consistencies, so this was excellent practice. It will be needed for the game I mentioned above--^)</p>\n<p>And....yep! That's all I got for you. It's a fairly short game admittedly but feel free to take your time with it! Have fun! And if you decide to play it,\u00a0 feel free to let me know!!! I'd love to hear y'all's reactions!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a6/8a61770a3714649514cf85997403de43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NightEzra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
