I have now therefore released the source code, in case it helps anyone else continue a similar project. Source is freely available for non-commerical use, including use of 2D images. Be aware that this is literally my first Unity game, and the code is poorly structured and poorly documented. Do not take it as a guide to how to build a properly-structured Unity game. If, despite this, it is helpful to you then I'm glad to have been of assistance.</strong><br/></p><p>Shadows Behind the Throne is a strategy game inspired by Crusader Kings, Pandemic and That Which Sleeps. You play as the omnipresent yet weak force of darkness, seeking to bring an end to the current age of light. Your tools are political intrigue and large-scale yet imprecise world-manipulation.<br/></p>\n<p>Take low-ranking barons under your control, and through political negotiations make them great emperors, secretly spreading your shadow across their entire kingdoms. Take a small county and, though natural rituals, bring a global ice age except for your own small patch of land, and bring the people of the world to you as desperate refugees seeking the last warmth. Or simply take a baron, start a plague, a couple of civil wars and take the world by force as your enemies are divided.</p>\n<p><strong>State of the game:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As it stands, the game is intended to be a framework for more features and further development. \u00a0That said, it is entirely playable, from beginning to end, features a range of playstyles and strategies.</p>\n<p>It's unbalanced and chaotic, but possibly in a good and fun way.</p>\n<p>Two versions are available, the older V13, which is hex-based, and has a wide range of different types of dark magic and powers, but has rather unfinished UI work, and the newer versions, starting at V20. These are location-and-link based, and are more polished, but lack some of the variety of the earlier versions\u00a0(for now).</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Overall Game: Bobby Two Hands</p>\n<p>Cover Art: Derek Restivo</p>\n<p>Featuring Writing By: Bill Redpath</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Mouse + Keyboard.</p>\n<p>Mouse handles camera panning, selecting (left to move/inspect, right to select), menu button clicking.</p>\n<p>Keyboard camera panning through WASD or arrow keys, map-view lenses bound to 1,2,3,4 and 0.</p>\n<p>Mouse wheel or z/x keys for map zoom</p>\n<p>Left shift for quick change between world and societal views</p>\n<p>Right click on a city to jump to city view, or use the \"inspect hex\" command with a hex selected to view all armies and cities in that hex.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum specs</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Minor. </p>\n<p>2D graphics and turn based nature require little in the way of CPU or GPU power.
