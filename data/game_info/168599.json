A team of incredible developers came together to simulate the experience of fluid painting in a digital context. This app can be useful for a 1 year old and a 100 year old person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It is designed with multiple intentions to heal mental and emotional pain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The movement of paint directed and manipulated by the touch of your finger along with the soothing ambient sounds induces mindfulness and a state of calm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alternatively, users can\u00a0select the setting; \"feelings\" to identify daily emotions. Emotions are matched with their corresponding colors. This option allows users to literally paint with their feelings. Emotions are recorded for the user to communicate with their mental health providers in an effort to refine diagnoses and treatment to enhance their\u00a0chance of recovery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created at #MegaHealthJam 2018 in Orlando, FL.</p>\n\n<p>PROJECT MANAGER/DESIGNER-</p>\n<p>Victoria Michael</p>\n<p>DEVELOPERS-</p>\n<p>LEAD- Jordan Calderwood</p>\n<p>Hector Serrano</p>\n<p>Sean Abbott</p>\n<p>SPECIALIST/ARTIST-</p>\n<p>Jason Phillips</p>\n<p>SOUND-</p>\n<p>Carlos Ivan Marquez</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fa/5fab888b1019ff6bc6a9f63f3aa44ba2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["EunoiaCollective"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
