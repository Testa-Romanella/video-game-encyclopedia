I wanted to do an early release of the game once I had the first puzzle done! I am going to be MIA for 3 or 4 days for the holidays so I at least got a quick version of the game out.<br/><br/>Currently there is 1 puzzle. The final game will have 3-4 including some cat friends to dance with you :)) &lt;3 Happy holidays!<br/><br/>There are no in game hints for the puzzle. It is solvable in two separate ways :)\u00a0<br/>I have done very little bug testing or optimization so I am sorry if its not working correctly &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T12:39:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aac/aac61815733670131c416d35e95a6eae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mrferretgames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
