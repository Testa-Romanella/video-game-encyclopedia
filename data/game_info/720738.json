If you don't deliver the pizza in time, the customer will be mad and won't pay you any money. If you don't deliver the pizza before your shift ends, a small fee will be subtracted from your wage. Get a positive wage to continue to the next level! The levels will increase in difficulty, so be ready!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>You can move around with \"A\" and \"D\"\u00a0</li><li>Get on and off your scooter with \"S\"</li><li>Throw pizzas with \"W\"\u00a0</li><li>Get pizzas at the pizzeria with \"Space Bar\" Though you need to be off your scooter to be able to get one.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Personal note:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All the assets and programming is done by me, except for the sounds of the customers. Those were made by a very good friend of mine\u00a0:) The world is procedurally generated, so every level will be slightly different. This project was made for an university project.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Updates:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I'm still interested in working on this game. I think about adding a buy system in game to be able to use your wage to buy something like a pizza bag to carry more pizzas to make harder levels less difficult.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will also be doing bug fixes if you guys find any\u00a0(I'm sure there are still a lot of them)</p>\n<p>~Peter Schenkels :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T07:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68c/68c22693136b1500fdf6b5115e35dfe0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PeterSchenkels"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
