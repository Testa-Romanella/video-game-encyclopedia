{"id": 56583, "slug": "journey-1989", "name": "Journey (1989)", "name_original": "Journey (1989)", "description": "<p>Journey: The Quest Begins is an interactive fiction computer game designed by Marc Blank, with illustrations by Donald Langosy, and released by Infocom in 1989. Like the majority of Infocom's works, it was released simultaneously for several popular computer platforms of the time, such as the Commodore 64, Apple II, and PC. Journey is unusual among Infocom games in that it could be played entirely via mouse or joystick with no typing required. It was also the thirty-fifth and last game released by Infocom before parent company Activision closed the Cambridge office, effectively reducing Infocom to a \"label\" to be applied to later games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:49:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/735/735866a9e2ce5200e5e640d201b863eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Classic Macintosh", "Apple II", "PC"], "developers": ["Infocom"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Infocom"], "esrb_rating": null}
