Press Q and E to cycle through them. Each mode has different left and right click actions. In stream mode (the default), left click fires a wind stream from the spirit to the cursor and right click will fire a wind tunnel that better captures cranes.</p>\n<p><strong>Freehand mode</strong> lets you draw wind streams and tunnels anywhere on the screen. <strong>Orb mode</strong> projects a suction or a blowing force centered around the spirit. <strong>Lock mode</strong> lets you set wind streams and tunnels in the air for a period of time. <strong>Element mode</strong> lets you fire a wide heat beam that makes objects rise with LMB. Hold RMB in element mode to charge up a powerful narrow stream. Release to fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>Watch out for hazards! Use the mouse to look ahead of your current position. The music will change as well to indicate something dangerous is nearby. Do not let your cranes touch the bush or they will be destroyed! If all your cranes are destroyed, you will have to start the level again!</p>\n<p>Push as many cranes as you can through the window to finish the level. If you have left some cranes behind, you can enter the level exit with your spirit to finish it early. Good luck on your journey!</p>\n<p>For\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/pandan-jam-1<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>@JojojoGame (Game design, Visual design, UI design, &amp; Level design)</p>\n<p>Lucinius (Lead programmer)</p>\n<p>@entropygamedev (Music, SFX, Audio programming, and City level design)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:38:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/541e1f3417b1bf95075f638e6ddea2b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["entropygamedev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
