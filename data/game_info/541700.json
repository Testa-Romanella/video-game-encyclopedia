Because our cultural backgrounds are very different, so that will be very interesting.</p>\n<p>This is one of my newest games, and it just happened to be recently updated in English so I could come here and share it with you.</p>\n<p>It is offered here as a free trial version, which allows you to experience the flow and story of a character in its entirety, and has no problem being treated as a full game.</p>\n<p>When you first start playing this game, you may find it boring. But I hope you will be patient enough to finish it and maybe we will have some soul contact.</p>\n<p>It's my first time here to show the game and I don't know what to say, so here goes.\u00a0I also don't know how to decorate the page to look better.<br/></p>\n<p>If you like the game, you can go and buy the full version on STEAM.\u00a0It doesn't matter if you don't buy it, I don't want to become a tiresome salesman.<br/></p>\n<p>My English is not good, so I used translation software for the above.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:14:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58a/58a1b70be36b28edc8b58154a23161d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrazyPrince"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
