The main current priorities for development are:</p>\n<p>1) More content (unique monster skills in dungeon levels beyond 4 and more player races/classes),<br/></p>\n<p>2) More polish,</p>\n<p>3) Help / tutorials etc.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Have you ever wanted to defeat fearsome monsters? Ants. Bees. Voles. Picaro knows no limits.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps you want to feel like a technological wizard, with all the latest gadgets? In Picaro your character can wield not just gloves but mittens. None shall dare oppose you and your opposable thumbs.</p>\n<p>Last and quite possibly least, take advantage of mysterious magics and terrific techniques like the awe-inspiring 'dash'.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Please note that this game is completely free. If you like it, please consider donating some money to a charity of your choice and let me know in the comments. It would be great if some good could come from Picaro :-). Thank you. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d5c7c013752829d7e072143a3cdcd24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gus314"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
