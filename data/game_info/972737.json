The levels start simple, but ramp up to include several moving parts and tricky solutions. You'll need to plan your placements carefully in order to win!<h3>Featuring:</h3>80 hand-crafted levels to master<br/><br/><br/>An N-body gravity system where everything can move if something near it is heavy enough, or if something crashes into it. These puzzles are firmly grounded in real orbital mechanics!<br/>(Aside from the targets. They don't move.)<h3>Unique types of matter for unique puzzles:</h3>Antimatter: Crash a normal object into it to launch it away and shave off some mass. Or avoid doing that if you need to keep something onscreen.<br/><br/><br/>Exotic matter: It has negative mass, which means it pushes things away instead of attracting them. It's still attracted to normal matter, though.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-27T06:22:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/83117720eef0524204aa06418dad5ff1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Sean Frett"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sean Frett"], "esrb_rating": null}
