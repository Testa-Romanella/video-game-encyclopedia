We had to rush through the last days to make a couple of levels playable, but we didn't quite get to the point where we would be able to  fit the theme.<br/><br/>Controls:</p>\n<p>* Move around with the mouse and WASD keys<br/>* Use 'F' to pick up crates and drop them off<br/>* When you pick up the portal generation device, left click to open the first portal, and right click to open the other one.<br/>* 'A' throws physics driven cubes (which may be useful to enable pressure plates if you manage to lose all the crates)<br/>* Jump with spacebar<br/>* Tab attempts to capture/release the mouse cursor when in fullscreen mode.</p>\n<p>(Biggest) Known issues:<br/>* The physics are fairly unstable, as a lot of shortcuts were taken to make things somewhat work in the duration of the jam. If you try to yeet off the map, you will find a way.<br/>* The game can take a few seconds on a black screen to boot up, this is mostly caused by decomposing some of the collider meshes in convex components on startup.<br/>* The trigger for level change in the elevator can sometimes get blocked by your collision flags not being properly restored on exiting a portal. If you get locked this way, you can usually resolve it by going in and out of portals until the trigger unlocks.<br/></p>\n<p>The cocnept: the idea was to eventually give portals physical properties that you would have to play with and combine together to be able to complete the puzzles, but you can only see the very beginning of that in the second stage, when your second portal starts pushing away at the exit. (I unfortunately had to disable the first portal pulling in just before release as it made the physics engine very sad a bit too often). We may revisit the concept in the future. We may have a fetish for portals.</p>\n<p>Even if the final result is a little rough, we still had a lot of fun and learned a ton making this entry, so, it's all good :D<br/></p>\n<p>Github repo is at https://github.com/Robzz/bevy-jam-2/<br/></p><p>Assets from the Unity Assets Store were used to assemble the levels: [1] [2]<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T18:22:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ef/6ef86437adcc209c5966d95661fc6664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Robzz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
