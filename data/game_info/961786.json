This fungus was a large inspiration for the video game series Last of Us and is often affectionately referred to as the \"Zombie Fungus\".<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game offers several different control schemes to accommodate all sorts of players from those who have never used VR before (and those susceptible to motion sickness) to those who want a more interactive experience. Educational content reading level recommended for ages 12+.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis project was a student &amp; recent-grad driven endeavor developed through a collaboration between the University of Central Florida (UCF) biology &amp; game development departments as well as the University of Utrecht (UU) biology department.
