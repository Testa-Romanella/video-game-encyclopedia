It is played by changing the color of the tiles on the surface of a geodesic sphere, if said change creates a match of 4+ tiles of the same color, they disappear.<br/><br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><br/>-\u00a0<strong>Powerups\u00a0</strong>generated by the player destroying tiles in certain ways, such as a\u00a0<strong>wildcard\u00a0</strong>tile created when matching at least 4 tiles in a \"triforce pattern\", or a\u00a0<strong>bomb\u00a0</strong>created when matching 6+ tiles.<br/><br/>- The game gets\u00a0<strong>increasingly complex</strong>\u00a0making the player place \"blocks\" of several tiles at the same time instead of just one.<br/><br/>-\u00a0<strong>Combos</strong>\u00a0can be achieved when new matches are created by the falling tiles when matched tiles disappear or when 2+ colors are changed with the same move.<br/><br/>- An\u00a0<strong>endless mode</strong>\u00a0with a move limit. The player can get more moves by destroying tiles but it gets harder and harder until he/she runs out.<br/><br/>- A\u00a0<strong>time attack mode</strong>. Same but with a time limit instead of a move limit.<br/><br/>- At least\u00a0<strong>60 levels</strong>\u00a0with\u00a0<strong>varying rules and goals</strong>: Destroy X number of tiles, destroy X number of sphere layers, reach X score, make certain tiles fall to the bottom of the sphere...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d53463cd65c9a9b1acf8603fe262417.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arturofbc"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
