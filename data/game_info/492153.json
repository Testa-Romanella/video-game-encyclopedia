{"id": 492153, "slug": "squares-rage", "name": "Squares Rage", "name_original": "Squares Rage", "description": "<strong>Squares Rage</strong> is a minimalist style puzzle / \"rage\" game, in which the player is a square who must navigate through a series of puzzles that get increasingly more difficult. Use the arrow keys to navigate the square to the flag at the end of the level in as few deaths as possible! Press 'S' to self-destruct (if you need to)! <br/><br/>Prepare your cheapest keyboard for this game too. You'll probably be throwing it across the room after dying so many times.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>There are four difficulties to play the game on</strong><br/><strong>* Easy:</strong> Unlimited Deaths allowed. Play on easy to get a feel for the game or just to practice the levels!<br/><strong>* Medium:</strong> 50 Deaths allowed. If you surpass 50 deaths, you must start back from the beginning. If you don't want to smash your computer, I recommend playing on medium.<br/><strong>* Hard:</strong> 10 Deaths allowed. If you surpass 10 deaths, you must start over. If you feel like getting angry today, this is the mode for you.<br/><strong>* Impossible:</strong> Just as the name implies, this is probably impossible (or at least very, very, VERY difficult). You are allowed 1 death before you must start over. If you can beat the game in this mode, I salute you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are 25 levels in all with several different themes to each of them. Don't let that fool you either, however. It will probably take several hours to get through them all flawlessly.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T10:24:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30c/30c6f78de8e4e39c54a250f6f82e9dfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ajay Arora", "Ajay Arora Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ajay Arora"], "esrb_rating": null}
