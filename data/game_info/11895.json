In one such spoke of the wheel, we come to the story of Prithvilok, a realm ruled by beings of energy that seem to be nothing but myths to us mortals. In this beautiful and mythical land, the never-ending battle between Good and Evil is at its penultimate chapter.<br/><br/>Raakh, eager to follow in his father's footsteps and fulfill his duty as guardian of the Sacred Trident, finds himself in the biggest trial of his life when his father dies unexpectedly. He must now protect the trident and his Prtihvilok (earth realm) from Shukracharya, the most intelligent of the Seven Sages, who has decided that humans can only be truly free when there are no Gods to rule them.
