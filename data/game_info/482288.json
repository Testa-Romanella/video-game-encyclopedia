FOUR+\" by Dr. Dos</p>\n<p>Requires ZZT v3.2 and Zeta to run.</p>\n<p>Windows users can run <em>UPTOWN.BAT</em> with Zeta and ZZT installed to load the font<br/>and Zeta automatically.</p>\n<p>Linux users should run `<em>zeta86 -e UPSIDE.COM -e ZZT.EXE</em>`</p>\n<p>To play without the font, just run Zeta directly.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>\"Upsidetown\" is simply Tim Sweeney's 1991 ZZT world \"Town of ZZT\" flipped<br/>vertically. It was done mostly as a goof. Something simple (so I thought) that<br/>could be finished quickly enough during a jam in which I was more invested in<br/>watching speedruns more than anything else.</p>\n<p>Originally, I was going to mirror the world horizontally but then I realized<br/>Upsidetown is a good pun.</p>\n<p><strong>Guidance for non-ZZTers</strong></p>\n<p>If you've never played ZZT before, simply choose keyboard and color on the main<br/>screen and hit \"P\" on the game's title to begin playing. If you're using the<br/>font the text will be a bit hard to read.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys move. Shift + arrow keys shoot. \"T\" lights a torch. \"S\" saves. Town is<br/>most people's first ZZT game so it shouldn't be too hard to learn what things<br/>do. It does however have a few possible softlocks, some of which won't be<br/>immediately obvious. (Save before you do anything in the bank.)</p>\n<p>You can use \"?\" to open a cheat prompt where you can use the following cheats:</p>\n<p>* \"HEALTH\"<br/>* \"AMMO\"<br/>* \"TORCHES\"<br/>* \"GEMS\"<br/>* \"KEYS\"<br/>* \"ZAP\"</p>\n<p>The cheats are not case sensitive. \"?ZAP\" can be used to erase the tiles<br/>adjacent to the player.</p>\n<p><strong>Development</strong></p>\n<p>The process for turning Town upsidedown begins with a script for Zookeeper<br/>that takes an input world and flips the board layout and stats. I actually wrote<br/>the script a few days prior to the jam as just a silly idea I had, then realized<br/>there was more effort needed to actually get a fully playable game out of the<br/>script and shelved it like most things I start.</p>\n<p>But then the jam happened and I didn't have any better ideas so I went back to<br/>it.</p>\n<p>The script only properly handled the most obvious of things which meant that<br/>after it was done generating a new world, I had to manually make several changes<br/>by hand including:</p>\n<p>* Replacing all directions in ZZT-OOP (so /n/n/n became /s/s/s)<br/>* Changing the direction of transporters<br/>* Changing the direction of blinkwalls<br/>* Changing the direction of duplicators<br/>* Changing the direction of conveyors[1]</p>\n<p>In reality, modifying the script to do everything but ZZT-OOP should have been<br/>trivial, but I already had flipped the OOP first and didn't want to have to<br/>merge my work with a better script output.</p>\n<p>Also in reality, the code in Town at least is simple enough that I probably<br/>could have rigged up ZZT-OOP flipping as well.</p>\n<p>Even as I wrote the script for flipping, I knew that a smarter idea would be to<br/>use the Reconstruction of ZZT's source code to straight up draw the board<br/>upsidedown and not have to modify the ZZT world whatsoever, but then I'd have<br/>to write Pascal instead of Python, and let's be real this is a novelty at best.</p>\n<p>With the project mostly completed I realized that actually the easiest way to<br/>play some upsidedown ZZT is to use a web browser build of Zeta and just apply<br/>the CSS `transform: rotate(180deg);` to the canvas.</p>\n<p>Also I made a font that turns code page 437 upsidedown as well. I tried doing<br/>my final full run test of the game with it, and promptly quit as it was totally<br/>messing with my mind and I was struggling to cross the three lakes board.</p>\n<p>Also also my script had a few bugs in it which meant more hand-fixing things<br/>than I would have liked, such as corrupting the last board, or breaking horribly<br/>when the player was located on the very top or very bottom row. This is one<br/>reason why I didn't release the script. The other reason is that it requires a<br/>yet unfinished updated version of the Zookeeper library for manipulating ZZT<br/>worlds that I'd also have to distribute for anybody to be able to use it.</p>\n<p><strong>Cool Links</strong></p>\n<p>* Museum of ZZT - A modern archive of 2000+ ZZT<br/>worlds which can be downloaded, explored, or played in a browser<br/>* Worlds of ZZT on Twitter - A Twitter bot<br/>which posts screenshots of random ZZT boards every three hours and serves as<br/>the main source of news about ZZT<br/>* Worlds of ZZT on Patreon - I work on the<br/>Museum and write about ZZT games.
