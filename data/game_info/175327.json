But enough buzzwords, have a look at some webms instead:</p>\n<p>Combat<br/></p>\n<p>Procedural Generation<br/></p>\n<p>Equipment<br/></p>\n\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Currently only supports keyboard.</p>\n<p>Movement - WASD</p>\n<p>Camera - Mouse</p>\n<p>Attack - Mouse1</p>\n<p>Target - Tab</p>\n<p>Block - Hold Left Shift (only when shield is equipped and targeting)</p>\n<p>Open Inventory - i</p>\n<p>Loot Enemy - F</p>\n<p>Exit Game - Alt + F4</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>One of everything. This is a very cursory glance of what is to come once all the base systems are in place. There is currently a single enemy, a handful of items and a single world.</p>\n\r\nNotes\r\n<p>Your feedback is valuable! Please send any feedback, ideas or criticism to this game/account by commenting or sending a private message. Everything is welcome.</p>\n<p>The AI pathfinding takes a little time to kick in, so if the enemies don't move, try waiting a little.</p>\n<p>Serious bug: In rare cases when generating of the world, the generation will crash. You can see this as nothing new will pop up into view, or you might freeze entirely at the loading screen (Error visible in another window). At this point you will have to restart the game. Sorry about that!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:30:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e521b3e636a7039bc6d78199d36f69d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SomeDungeonGame"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
