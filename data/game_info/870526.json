At first glance, the town looks  completely normal, but you will soon discover that the villagers are  supposed to be monsters! They ask you to return them to their true  forms. Players must travel into the nearby dungeon in search of potion  ingredients, dropped from enemies or collected from the ground. Players  may choose to leave the dungeon once they believe they have collected  enough. If they are defeated by enemies, they will lose most of their  items. Upon returning to the town, <br/>players can craft new potions,  granting them buffs for their next visit to the dungeon.\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://forms.gle/rmm6xRcsTeqx9sbS8<br/></p><p>Controls: <br/></p>\n<p>E: Interact with Villagers</p>\n<p>WASD: Movement <br/></p>\n<p>LMB: Cast Spell <br/></p>\n<p>RMB: Defense Spell <br/></p>\n<p>Scroll Wheel: Switch Spell<br/></p>\n<p>Space: Dash</p>\n<p>K: Return to Town<br/></p>\n<p>1 2 3: Use Potion<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T10:27:38", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DubiouslyPurpleCookie", "doctorquackerzzz", "Alaska15", "ojones2116", "colton.lambert", "justinmarko", "NateBeeler"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
