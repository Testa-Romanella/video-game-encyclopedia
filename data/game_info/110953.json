{"id": 110953, "slug": "nova-factor-alpha-version", "name": "Nova Factor - Alpha Version", "name_original": "Nova Factor - Alpha Version", "description": "**This game requires two people to play**\u00a0\r\n<p>Currently the game only works over LAN or direct IP over Hamachi/LAN, meaning that both players need to be on the same network.\u00a0 Port 7777 is needed to play so if you try to just connect over the internet you will need to make sure that port 7777 is open and forwarded.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>The game's networking does not work on the Eduroam network or any network that blocks peer to peer discovery.</strong></p>\n<p>After getting the game you can simply copy the files to another computer or give them to your friends.</p>\r\nNova Factor is a 1 versus 1, competitive first person shooter.\r\n<p>A match consists of five total rounds.\u00a0\u00a0The first round of the match only contains the players themselves. \u00a0As the players navigate the map, shoot, jump, etc, their movements are recorded.\u00a0\u00a0The second round spawns the players into the map in exactly the same way as the first round. \u00a0The addition to round two is a replay team mate that also spawns.\u00a0\u00a0This replay will exactly play out the previous round\u2019s movements until it becomes unshackled. \u00a0The unshackling process is activated by three different conditions.</p>\r\nA.I. Unshackling Conditions\r\n<p><strong>End of Recording</strong> -\u00a0The first condition is that the replay has reached the end of the recording where at that point the AI unshackles and becomes a free-roaming, hunting bot.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Change</strong> -\u00a0Something has changed in the recorded path. \u00a0Something is seen that wasn\u2019t there in the recording of the previous round, causing a different condition to exist and therefore unshackle the bot. \u00a0For example:\u00a0 seeing the enemy player from the current round that didn\u2019t exist in the previous round.</p>\n<p><strong>Taking Damage</strong> - The replay takes damage when it wasn\u2019t supposed to. \u00a0After taking damage the AI will become free-roaming and react to the new situation.\u00a0 \u00a0A player cannot shoot their own bots to unshackle them immediately.\u00a0 To avoid this game breaking strategy, friendly fire in the game does not exist.<br/></p>\r\nRound Replays\r\n<p>Each successive round spawns like the previous round. \u00a0The replay characters of those previous rounds are shackled to their recording from that previous round. \u00a0The replays are locked into playing out their recorded actions until they become unshackled. In the fifth and final round each player will have a full team of four AI bots and themselves.</p>\n<p>When a player dies, they have the option of jumping into any unshackled bot, that is still alive, to continue the battle. \u00a0The icons located in the upper part of the screen represent the number of rounds that have been played in total, which includes the current round.</p>\n<p>The Heads Up Display provides a player the means of keeping track of the round numbers and the current state of both the player\u2019s and enemy\u2019s characters. \u00a0These round numbers assist the players in tracking who is still alive in the match and what state that character is in.</p>\n<p>For example, an X icon under a round number represents that the character from that round has been terminated. \u00a0If a character is possessing a character then there is a running person icon underneath the round number. If there is a robot head icon under a round number then that represents an unshackled AI is controlling that character. \u00a0A spinning clock icon under the the round number represents that a replay of a previous round is currently active on that round\u2019s character and has not become unshackled yet. A character cannot be possessed if it has not become unshackled yet.</p>\n<p><strong>The next update planned for this game begins in late September 2018.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Coming features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Adding a shotgun</li><li>Adding a\u00a0pistol</li><li>Adding a sniper rifle</li><li>Adding a submachine gun</li><li>Adding explosive grenade</li><li>Weapon selection at the beginning of a round.</li><li>Weapon selection limited to one per match and they are attached to the round/bot they were chosen in/by.</li><li>More maps</li><li>Match spectate mode</li><li>Weapon recoil</li><li>Weapon spread</li></ul>\r\nNova Factor won the Innovation Award at the Gotland Game Conference 2018.<br/><em>Information PDF</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/659/6595f90e9c12cacf267cf178b98bb81a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bloodberry Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
