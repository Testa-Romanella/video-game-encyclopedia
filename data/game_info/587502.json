{"id": 587502, "slug": "shader-worlds", "name": "Shader Worlds", "name_original": "Shader Worlds", "description": "<p>\"Shader Worlds\" is a mini project completed over the course of a month as part of a university assignment. The project investigates various effects that can be achieved using Unity's shader graphs, but also expands on them to create atmospheric 'worlds' that you can visit!</p>\n<p>Each world is uniquely crafted to best suit particular types of shaders, coupled with additional features like sound, particle systems, and objects that match the setting. There are a total of 7 worlds to explore which you can travel to via the portals. If you fall off the island, you will be teleported back to the island you were just on. Happy exploring!</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:\u00a0</strong>there is a bug with one of the portals not correctly displaying the view through the portal door. This may be fixed in the future after studies have concluded, but for now I will not have time to address this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T09:47:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c5/9c52c1fb3c1d03589e05414cbf6fe5f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slapeyy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
