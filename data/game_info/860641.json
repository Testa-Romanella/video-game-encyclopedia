It only has 8 levels..</p>\n<p>Unlike Pac-Man there are no Ghost, Enemies, or Power Pellets in this game instead you just collect the coins then go to the exit to proceed to the next level. This is just the concept I am trying out for now in future versions it may be a bit different.<br/></p>\n<p>All My Games Present and Future will be made available for downloading Free of any Charge or Payment, but If you would like to donate to my Nes Game Making Efforts you can do so here<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T17:57:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc6cdf2020ed8e5c72a422656616735.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Debiru"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
