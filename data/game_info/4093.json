Something messy is festering in suburbia, and only one hero can save the day! Germinator twists the bubble genre, wiping away old school match-three. Crash germ bubbles into those of the same color. Combine and grow them until they explode in a splattering goop. Trigger power-ups to pop them all and mess up the screen. Timing and accuracy are the keys to solving puzzles and preventing the germs from rising too high. 75 story levels will keep you coming back to clean every room in the house and 75 puzzle levels will test your crafty sanitization skills. Local multiplayer lets you battle your friends or the AI for sterilization supremacy. Unlimited arcade mode provides an onslaught of gooey germs to disinfect. Add Playstation\u00aeMove motion controller support and full 1080p for a messy good time.
