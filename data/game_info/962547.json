{"id": 962547, "slug": "symphony-of-souls", "name": "Symphony of Souls", "name_original": "Symphony of Souls", "description": "Set in the Greek Underworld, Symphony of Souls is a single-player, first-person platformer with music-inspired gameplay. You, as Orpheus, will rush through the Underworld, attempting to get to the end while platforming and solving puzzles to the beats of the music.<br/><br/>Explore the unnatural lands of the Underworld. The lands of the dead are irregular to the minds of mortals, where each region presents Orpheus with different challenges. The constant shifts in the locale will constantly keep both you and Orpheus on your toes, as you explore the modern retelling of the Greek tragedy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Throughout the Symphony of Souls, you can expect:<br/><strong>Rhythm is Everything:</strong> Every action that you can take on the beat will reward you, allowing you to flow through the level with ease and unlock more and more of our original soundtrack as a representation of your skills.<br/><strong>Advanced Player Movement:</strong> Orpheus can\u2019t rely simply on his musical talents to take on the land of the dead. He must be able to flow through the levels with magically gifted movement. With a combination of running across walls, dashing through the air, and even a grapple hook within his lyre, the only thing that could stop Orpheus may be Hades himself.<br/><br/>Lastly, Orpheus is a musician who weaves songs to life, and you will be as well! With that in mind, the music system in Symphony of Souls is interactive, where your performance affects it directly. As you progress through the levels, you will slowly build the music by performing actions on the beat, building upon the songs to show the full glory of the original soundtrack!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Symphony of Souls is a work of love. With a team spread across five different programs at LaSalle College Vancouver, the gameplay and story is an effort to show the creative take we hope to bring to our mediums of choice. Due to restrictions in budget and time, it encompasses only the first two levels of our project in this form: a free experience where you can enjoy and share with your friends!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T03:16:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f6/7f644c2e48283a7dbef194b9d7453c07.jpg", "website": "https://linktr.ee/symphonyofsouls", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Eonian"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Eonian"], "esrb_rating": null}
