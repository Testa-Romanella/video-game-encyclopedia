The result is a this cute little puzzle platformer, where each new powerup recontextualizes the space you are navigating. Then, at the end, you have to put all the powerups back, which is a wholly unique challenge as you have to figure out which order they must be returned in, you can't just do it in reverse order. I had a lot of fun making it, and I\u00a0hope you enjoy it too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:32:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/478/478bc3ae55fa7c7fac8bb265e5a6336c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Isaac Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
