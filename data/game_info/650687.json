If there is something that makes you unsatisfied, please don't give up easily! </strong><br/><br/><strong>What the developers say</strong><br/>This game was developed by myself for one year, and I only spent one year studying game development. Therefore, it is difficult to reach a relatively high level in terms of image quality and stability for the time being.<br/><br/><strong>Game background</strong><br/>In the distant future, the sun's lifespan unexpectedly reached the late stage and became a red giant star. The surface temperature of all celestial bodies in the solar system is rising rapidly. In order to survive, humans have migrated to the only surviving city on the earth, but this city will also be destroyed. Humans must flee the earth and go to other galaxies to establish a new civilization. (The game content of the new galaxy needs to be purchased separately)<br/><br/><strong>Game Features</strong><br/><ul>Survival</ul>You have to play the role of city manager to develop and grow the city as much as possible. The most important basis for the growth of a city is population. You need to do everything possible to develop population and build an interstellar spacecraft to fly to a new galaxy before destruction. The number of people will determine the difficulty of your game in the new galaxy.<br/><br/><ul>Strategy</ul>You need to decide who should do what, any one of your decisions will have a butterfly effect and bring unexpected effects, and ultimately affect the state of your city. When the population of the city is zero, the game will end.<br/><br/><ul>Programming</ul>The game opens an HTTP programming interface, allowing users to access and manipulate game data programmatically (such as obtaining all people in the game). The response of the program you develop to the game interface can determine the direction of the game. Among them, your technical level (Interface stability) will become an important factor affecting the progress of the game<br/><br/><ul>Practical combat</ul>When your game process enters the middle and late stages (the city has more than one hundred people), you will face the challenges of the Internet\u2019s three high scenarios: high concurrency, high performance, and high stability. You need to work under limited hardware conditions (usually you Your own computer), deal with the high frequency of the game's calls to your interface, deal with the processing of possible 100,000 or millions of data, and deal with the possible problems of how to ensure the stability of the interface.<br/><br/><ul>Task</ul>The game is light task, there will not be many tasks, the task is more to guide you how to better enter the game state. Normal tasks are free. <strong>There is a charge for learning tasks that are really valuable</strong>. This cost is not included in the game price. Learning tasks will guide you on how to solve the above mentioned tasks efficiently and quickly. Problem, but you can ignore the task and play according to your own ideas.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T12:07:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/065/06534aca24842c4c980f7d238fcf0ef9.jpg", "website": "http://zion.gamebrain.world/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u6e38\u620f\u8111"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u6e38\u620f\u8111"], "esrb_rating": null}
