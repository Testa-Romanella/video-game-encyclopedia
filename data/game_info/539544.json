You are Vasily Arkhipov aboard the secret B-59 USSR submarine during the height of the Cold War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. You have been found by the Americans who began dropping charges onto you. Can you keep your hot-headed captain from launching a nuclear torpedo, plunging the world into war?</p>\n<p>Interactive novel, standard controls apply -- choose your options to progress the story, and try to keep your captain from starting World War 3. Pretty standard stuff.<br/></p>\n<p>This was made for the Historically Accurate Game Jam 3 and is based on a real event. I used and edited real photos of the individuals involved where I could (there's something interesting about the Lieutenant...). Did a lot of research to make sure this was as historically accurate as possible, even found a few reports on the incident from both the US and USSR which included dialogue directly present in the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T04:37:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cd/9cd09714b79121e0e2aaf0e8256dfc7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Alex Chichester"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
