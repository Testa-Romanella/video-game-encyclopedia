Millionaire Lunch", "description": "\"Hina-chan's Big Trade! Millionaire Lunch\" is an adventure game where you trade all sorts of items with various characters in order to gather lots of food.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith no offers to be in the mainline games, Hina-chan, AKA Kagiyama Hina, has finally gone broke.<br/>\r\nWhen she looks in her fridge to prepare lunch, she finds nothing but a single cucumber.<br/>\r\nHowever, she doesn't let her misfortune get her down and comes up with the idea of trading her cucumber away to a friend, and then taking whatever she gets and trading it again -- working her way up to a lavish lunch like in the tale of the straw millionaire.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBy searching around and talking to other characters, you can find and be given different items.<br/>\r\nThen, by showing those items to different characters, you can trade them for new ones.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGather as much food as you can before lunch so you can have a nice, rich meal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe quality and amount of food you get will change your ending. Keep trying and aim to achieve the ultimate lunch!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour trade partner won't always trade you for whatever you show them, but they'll always give you some sort of response regardless.<br/>\r\nForgetting about lunch and just seeing reactions and making small talk can be fun, too.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T03:27:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29c/29c62439fc67035764c9e8d0f0c95dda.jpg", "website": "http://mizusoba.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-1051.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ISY"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["ISY"], "esrb_rating": null}
