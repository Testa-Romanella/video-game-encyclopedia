Your goal to bring stability to\u00a0the dystopian city-state island of the <em>North Wood</em> and thwart the hybridized, former <em>Secret Police Captain</em> turned <em>Terrorist</em>, <strong>Daxter Daemon-Northwood.<br/></strong></p>\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n<p><strong>Sword Of A Villain, Fists Of A Hero\u00a0</strong>- Killing is relatively easy in the <em>North Wood</em>, but it's even harder to just knock someone out for awhile. Ready your sword, or fists, and combat a variety of enemies, all of whom have their own names and identities, and whose death could destroy <strong>Aeydrien's</strong> <em>Reputation </em>with the <em>Organization </em>they're a part of, and cause far reaching changes to the <em>North Wood</em> as a whole.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>You're Made By The Shoes You Wear</strong> -\u00a0\u00a0Whether it's the pants she wears, or sword piece she upgrades, <strong>Aeydrien's</strong> attire and equipment will tell the world a lot about her. A strange, naked human wandering the streets is nothing to be worried over, but someone donning the telltale attire of a <em>North Wood Secret Police Officer</em> is another story.</p>\n<p><strong>The Unlimiter\u00a0System</strong> - Through the power of advanced cybernetics have <strong>Aeydrien </strong>break free from her body's natural limitations making her stronger, more durable, and even allowing her to slow down her perception of time. Be warned, however, pushing <strong>Aeydrien's</strong> body too far might result in injuries that even she can't heal from.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What A Strange And Bizarre Ultra Future</strong> - In the far flung future, there are only Nyims. <em>Cocoons </em>have allowed people to shed their humanity and become Animal-Human hybrids, <em>Cybernetics </em>keep alive that which should be dead, and the left over biomass is converted into an <em>Amalgam </em>and added to the work force, while all being watched over by the <em>North Wood Government</em> and\u00a0their <em>Representatives</em>. Law and order kept by the <em>Secret Police</em>, with you as one of their <em>Captains</em>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Every Death Makes You Weaker</strong> - Death is something that <strong>Aeydrien </strong>has started to grow intimately familiar with in her older age. Though lucky for her the medical bills are covered by the state, and with so little meat left on her bones maintenance is mostly mechanical. Unluckily for her, and you, is that each death takes a toll on her <em>Sanity</em>, and causes her to leave her <em>Salt </em>behind where she fell.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Awkward To A Fault</strong> - A woman of few words, or perhaps someone who just doesn't like to speak, <strong>Aeydrien </strong>is limited in how many Interactions she's able to have in a single sitting, with a single person. <em>Interaction Points</em> are few and far between, so choose your words wisely.</p>\n<p><strong>Talk To God</strong> - From a young age <strong>Aeydrien </strong>has had a special relationship with the capital G, God, or the <em>Waandishi </em>as they refer to themselves as, providing her aid when she needed it most, or maybe just pushing her down the path He wanted her down. Such wisdom taking form as her own voice speaking to her, at first, but now appearing as marks on walls, floors, and ceilings that only she can see.</p>\n<p><strong>The Life Of An Addict</strong> - Each life you take, takes its toll on <strong>Aeydrien's</strong> dwindling Sanity forcing her to self medicate through the herbal remedy known as <em>Blue Leaf</em> or deceptively addictive and stimulating <em>Java</em>. Or, perhaps, for a short time you'll let <strong>Aeydrien </strong>tap into her inner maniac and inject <em>Red Salt</em>, blinding you to her health, but allowing her to attack at nearly double her ordinary speed.<br/><br/><strong>Every Choice\u00a0Matters</strong> - Whether it be stealing the light from a lantern, choosing to leave your sword behind for more peaceful solutions\u00a0to conflict, or deciding you'd rather heal than buy that fancy new sword piece, every decision you choose to make, big or small, will have an impact on game play and the story.<br/></p>\n\r\nMinimum Specs:\r\n<p><strong>OS</strong>: Windows, 64-bit</p>\n<p><strong>Storage</strong>: 6 GBs<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Other Program(s)</strong>: 7zip (Or Similar Unzipping Program)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:19:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfd/dfd77dba4e6d0b562c591f0fd5972b21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Wood Block"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
