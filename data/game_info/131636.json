Your goal is to get to the end of a level using two different kinds of ammunition you can collect. They are red and blue and can destroy walls of the same color. There is a bug after you completed the game, but i figured it would be cheating to remove it afterwards;)</p><p>I haven't really coded before and it was my first time using c#(i'm a 3d artist usually) Hope you will have fun trying it out :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:37:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/313/313ebd351cba9977d865e8eddf724673.jpg", "website": "http://www.RisingHighstudio.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["RisingHigh Studio", "AmonKalagin"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["RISING HIGH STUDIO"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
