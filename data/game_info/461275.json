{"id": 461275, "slug": "armilla", "name": "Armilla", "name_original": "Armilla", "description": "The Art Direction Project, was a collaboration between the Master and Bachelor students at KADK.<br/>The goal was for all students to try working as in a team with a formal structure on a 3D project. The students\u00a0were tasked with setting up and managing a workflow and production pipeline within their team, and students\u00a0were asked to volunteer for preferred development roles before the project started.<br/>Two separate project were created\u00a0by five teams consisting of both bachelor and master students, both of which were based on the book Invisible Cities\u00a0by Italo Calvino, where students had to select a description of one of the cities to base their 3D project on.<br/>The projects were created in Unity, and the usage of online assets were permitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nArmilla, from Invisible Cities by Italo Calvin<br/><br/><em><em>Whether Armilla is like this because it is unfinished or because it has been demolished, whether the cause is some enchantment or only a whim, I do not know. The fact remains that it has no walls, no ceilings, no floors: it has nothing that makes it seem a city except the water pipes that rise vertically where the houses should be and spread out horizontally where the floors should be: a forest of pipes that end in taps, shouwers, spouts, overflows. Against the sky a lavabo\u2019s white stands out, or a bathtub, or some other porcelain, like late fruit still hanging from the boughs. You would think that the plumbers had finished their job and gone away before the bricklayers arrived; or else their hydraulic systems, indestructable, had survived a catastrophe, an earthquake, or the corrosion of termites.</em>\u00a0</em><br/><br/><em><em>Abandoned before or after it was inhabited, Armilla cannot be called deserted. At any hour, raising your eyes among the pipes, you are likely to glimpse a young woman, or many young women, slender, not tall of stature, luxuriating in the bathtubs or arching their backs under the showers suspended in the void, washing or drying or perfuming themselves, or combing their long hair at a mirror. In the sun, the threads of water fanning from the showers glisten, the jets of the taps, the spurts, the splases, the sponges\u2019 suds.</em>\u00a0<br/><br/></em><em><em>I have come to this explaination: the streams of water channeled in the pipes of Armilla have remained in th posession of nymphs and naiads. Accustomed to traveling along underground veins, they found it easy to enter the new aquatic realm, to burst from multiple fountains, to find new mirrors, new games, new ways of enjoying the water. Their invasion may have driven out the human beings, or Armilla may have been built by humans as a votive offering to win the favor of the nymphs, offended at the misuse of the waters. In any case, now they seem content, these maidens: in the morning you hear them singing.</em></em>\n\r\nProject 1 - Week 1 &amp; 2\r\nGroup 2 members\r\n<p>Nicolai Bruun - Art Director</p>\n<p>Gideon Rimmer - Lead Artist</p>\n<p>Bertram Jensen - Tech Artist</p>\n<p>Kaspar Dahl - 3d Artist</p>\n<p>Michelle Mortensen - 3d Artist</p>\n<p>Rosa Friholm\u00a0 - Texture Artist</p>\n<p>Sophie Pi - Concept Artist<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:53:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0a/a0a3c9d83aaf52ae0c1a644f3b40bf2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KADKGAME"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
