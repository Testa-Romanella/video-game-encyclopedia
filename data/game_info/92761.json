The Undead, the Goblins, the Karkadann, and the Humans have battle for centuries filling both heaven in hell with the souls of the dead. The divine powers have had enough and closed their doors, and in doing so have created Limbo.</em></p><p><em>Hoping to create peace and bring the 4 races together in mutual cooperation, the powers of heaven created 4 keys, one given to each race, that if used together would create a gate back into the world of the living. A compassionate gesture, but for peoples born of war, a futile one. The war raged on limbo each side fighting to secure the keys from the other races, open the portal, and return with a massive army to the world.</em></p><p><em>The humans in the world of the living used technology to fight the much stronger races, but here in limbo they have none. In Limbo, the humans were easily enslaved by the other races and forced to work, killed for pleasure, or used as food.</em></p><p><em>The world of the living continued to fight unaware of the chaos that awaited them in the after-life.</em></p><p><em>Then you died. You were a very shrewd. powerful, and tactful king. You won battles many thought destined for failure. Will you be the one to rescue your people in Limbo? Will you rally an army to win the freedom of your people? Will you fight to unify the 4 races or will you crush the races in Limbo and return with an army to end the war? Or will you fail and become just another goblin stew?</em></p><p>There is no sound yet, so just hum your favorite dungeon diving melody.</p><p>Let me know what you think.
