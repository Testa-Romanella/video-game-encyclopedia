The game demonstrates a simple audio mechanic that involves locating sonic \u201csweet spots\u201d in an otherwise silent soundscape. The game progresses as you unlock portals to new spaces for listening. Each level is a kind of composition that is explored and mixed through locomotion. There are many sounds to explore, including secret ones, and the pathway through each level eventually leads to a mysterious audio theatre.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T08:40:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ab/7abf2da003928edc82745aba73cb164c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["audiogameslab"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
