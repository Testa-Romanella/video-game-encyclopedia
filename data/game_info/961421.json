Defend your city by building towers, upgrading them with money from their fallen foes, and equipping them with strange items you find while scouting the world in an attempt to stop the endless assault!<br/><br/><strong>Where are they coming from?</strong><br/>Once they have found you they do not stop! Scout in the direction that the enemies are attacking you from in an attempt to find their source and to have some warning when something really nasty is headed your way!<br/><br/><strong>Upgrade and equip</strong><br/>Upgrade and equip towers with found items to increase the chances that your vain attempt to survive is sucessful! While upgrading is a great way to increase a tower's damage output, it quickly becomes expensive. A judiciously placed item can save you when all else fails! But be careful,  towers can only have a certain number of items and once an item is equipped to a tower it cannot be removed until that tower is demolished.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-29T02:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba7d2a222f615a01624f612ca0d698f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glovebox Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Glovebox Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
