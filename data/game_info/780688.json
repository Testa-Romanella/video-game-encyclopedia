I am following a course on GameDev.tv, linked here. This is the second finished project out of 5. However, I challenged myself to make some kind of changes to the game to go beyond just the tutorial. <br/></p>\n<p>This time I went with more of a coding challenge. I added platforms that can do more than just move back and forth from one location to another. These new platforms can have multiple stops, wait for a time at each stop, go at different speeds, and so forth!</p>\n<p>I also challenged myself to make a change that would make the level designing part easier. I added a way to add a new stop and autofilling the location and rotation using the platforms' current location and rotation. It saved me from having to copy and paste values over and over. Additionally, I learned how to make display names of array elements much more readable. Instead of a stop being called \"members: 4\", I can optionally give it a name so I have a better idea of where it's pointing to.</p>\n<p>Anyways, enough technical stuff! This game is almost the same as the other one, but with two new platforms right at the start. Step on the left platform to go on a wild ride and the right will take you on a scenic route to the castle. Controls are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong>: Move around</li><li><strong>Space Bar:</strong> Jump</li><li><strong>R</strong>: Restart level</li><li><strong>Escape</strong>: Exit game</li></ul><p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T13:00:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/722/722544bb4bb7bb638a823e1fb23efda9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calae"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
