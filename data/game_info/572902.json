After years I decided to finish it but realized the developers of Construct 2 has ruined the engine in an attempt to push their new Construct 3 which introduces a subscription model. Decided to try and re-implement the game in Godot and managed to do it faster there. There are still features I am planning to add whenever I have spare time.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:08:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/877/8771cec8abf35862a34b7891c4b340d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zooid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
