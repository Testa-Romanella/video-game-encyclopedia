I spent countless hours kicking ass in streets of rage and many more mastering the speed of a small anthropomorphize hedgehog. video games have been part of my life for many years and its an art form that I'll always love. \u00a0</p>\n<p>I started edgy games exactly 1.5 year ago and have been passionately working on zombie teacher since then. I started the game with no knowledge of programming or game design and have learnt much along the way. growing up with an older brother meant a lot of split screen gaming so having a co-op mode in zombie teacher is something i'm really excited about. Lets talk on twitter! :) https://twitter.com/zombieteacher92</p>\n<p><strong>KICKSTARTER</strong></p>\n<p>There's a kickstarter running for Zombie Teacher in the month of February. Please spread the word and spread the love! There's a bunch of really cool things up for grabs, together we can complete this game!</p>\n<p>For all the latest news and updates visit www.zombieteacher.com</p>\n<p>zombieteachergames@hotmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ee/0eef30770582effb623990a3ecf130c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zombie Teacher"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
