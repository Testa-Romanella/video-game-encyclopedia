With only the use of the space bar, you will decrease Bubble's oscillation frequency so he can proceed with his psychedelic trip, while he dodges the dangerous enemies that he'll find along the way. Grab power ups, avoid barb wires, carrots and lettuces unless you have the invincibility shield. </p><p>Credits: Mery Bonjour (Art) /Sebasti\u00e1n Garcia (Art)/ Nicol\u00e1s Almada ( Art) /Giselle Ruiz (Production)/ Enzo Gaiero (Programming) /Santiago Ramos(Music/SFX) /Joint game design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb1/bb15a63aab315f4c7c3d7d749d62035d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["FrenziedPlatypus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
