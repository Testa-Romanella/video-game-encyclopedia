Because LCD technology granted the developers a very limited amount of on-screen real estate in which to place the action-packed gaming experiences, the games themselves tended to be extremely focused. There was little room for design screw-ups. If the game mechanic wasn't simple enough, or addictive enough, then the game failed. It was just player and mechanic, and that's it.<br/></p>\n<p>If you've never had the opportunity to play a proper Game &amp; Watch unit, then here's your chance, with this simulation of one of my favorite games in the series, Donkey Kong, released in 1982.\u00a0</p>\n<p>[<strong>Developer's Note</strong>: I developed this over the course of a few hours, so there may still be some bugs I haven't managed to track down.]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T04:30:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/750/75085f132f030ab6eff9f2bcad93eeae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itizso"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
