It is a text adventure, with all of its elements randomly generated based on a set of rules. It gets very silly very fast, so hopefully it will make you smile.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t The game was made for ProcJam 2014, and the idea was to make a game with randomly generated elements. I have always enjoyed text adventures, but prefer them to have a graphical element, so I wanted to make a game with the verbs of text adventures, but a more visual inventory and map. To play the game you drag something from the left onto an icon on the right, the game then tries to figure out the interaction and give an outcome. I had to try and write around 8,000 interactions, so please forgive me if not all of them work. You end up either finding the quest item, or dying in the process. There's no real challenge to the game, it's just meant to be a bit of fun. Enjoy! All of the things are randomly generated from a pool of about 300.</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\t The whole game is controlled with the mouse, use the left mouse button to drag and drop things from your inventory onto things on the map.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe basic idea is that you are a random adventurer, and you have certain items and skills. These are represented on the left of the screen by coloured buttons. The right of the screen shows you current location, and icons that represent what you can see. These are in categories of building, scenery, obstacle, item, creature, NPC, danger and exit. It doesn't really matter if you win or lose, so try whatever you want and see what happens!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay, Writing<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d79/d791ce488f6cd396be60cedb5d416033.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
