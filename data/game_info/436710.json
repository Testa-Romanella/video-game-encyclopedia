Unsure of what to do, you start to look around...\"</p>\n<p>This is the sequel to Don't Look Weird, Something Looks Weird! It's a game I worked on, on and off for about a year. It's definitely a lot more surreal then DLW, so expect to see some weird stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The OST from magicdweedoo can be found here:\u00a0https://dweedes.bandcamp.com/album/something-looks-weird-ost</p>\n<p>It takes about 10 - 20 minutes to complete, and has some light puzzles in it. I made it with HTML in mind, but there's also a exe you can download if you prefer that.</p><p>Additionally, there is now a walk through txt if you get stuck! It's all the answers too, so, make sure you really don't know what to do</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:05:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f4a7f79b9b3c4bd45ae565cd262b78b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GebbOS Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
