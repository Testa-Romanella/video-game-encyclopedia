Starting the game for the first time doesn't make any of the code for the green line work. You\u00a0</p>\n<p>must press \"r\" at the start and then the game should work fine</p>\n\n<p>*Game*</p>\n<p>Offline, 1v1, 2D, shooter. The red duck and her bullets move faster than the blue duck and</p>\n<p>their bullets, however the blue duck has more health. The objective is to use advanced movement and</p>\n<p>skillful shooting to overcome your opponent. The green line separates the two sides. Hitting the green</p>\n<p>line will cause you to immediately lose. Depleting all your enemy's health will increase your score</p>\n<p>and vice versa for your enemy. Sometimes if multiple buttons are pressed at the same time one of the</p>\n<p>inputs won't work. Oops. Holding the shoot button or pressing it multiple times in quick succesion</p>\n<p>will make the bullets deal more damage. This isn't intentional and I'm not sure how to fix it, sorry.</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun and enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>*Controls*</p>\n<p>Red duck:</p>\n<p>\"a\" &amp; \"d\" for left and right movement</p>\n<p>\"w\" for jump</p>\n<p>\"s\" for crouch (hold, not toggle)</p>\n<p>\"v\" for shoot</p>\n<p>Blue duck:</p>\n<p>\"left arrow\" &amp; \"right arrow\" for left and right</p>\n<p>\"up arrow\" for jump</p>\n<p>\"down arrow\" for crouch</p>\n<p>\"p\" for shoot</p>\n<p>Other:</p>\n<p>\"space\" to reset score</p>\n<p>\"r\" reset game (doesn't affect score)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T08:08:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/540/540cba6f358caf5f5a070e37236a80fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ItisConn"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
