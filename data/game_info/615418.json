Then there\u2019s those pesky space pirates to deal with. Asteroid fields. Mines. Wormholes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh my!</p>\n<p>But the trickiest part, by far, is docking! As you\u2019ll soon discover!</p>\n<p>Good luck, Pilot! :D\u00a0</p>\n\r\nFeatures:\u00a0\r\n\n<p>* 100 space stations across 10 different systems to dock with!\u00a0</p>\n<p>* 10 different spaceships to unlock and fiy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>* Six classical chiptune music tracks provided by the awesome Classical 8bit\u00a0</p>\n<p>* Challenging hazards such as asteroids, space pirates, mines, wormholes and even mysterious black monoliths!\u00a0</p>\n<p>* Excess fuel unlocks different colour schemes! Rescuing astronauts unlocks new music!</p>\r\nNotes:\r\n<p>The game starts in a window on your Mac in portrait mode.\u00a0Please do not enter\u00a0'Fullscreen' mode as this will distort the image.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game can be pretty tricky to control. Not sure the 'swipe to move' translates all that well to using a mouse/trackpad, but it is what it is. Sorry! Hope it's not *too*\u00a0frustrating :O</p>\n<p>Also, the interface is built with touch input in mind, so you'll need to click on buttons on-screen to use menus and stuff! Sorry!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T06:02:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ca/9cad85c0344bdf1ab8054598abe29a32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Quantum Sheep"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
