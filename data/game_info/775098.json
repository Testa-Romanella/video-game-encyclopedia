In <strong>Bullet Bastion</strong> you are in command of the Bastion on the night that the evil Krabulons invade.\u00a0 Build up your defenses and pump the aliens full off lead, shrapnel,\u00a0lasers and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Bullet Bastion</strong> was developed for the 2022 Bullet Hell Game Jam. For which participants had to create a bullet hell game in 10 days with the theme \"confined\". This quickly gave me the idea that the player would generate the bullet hell from one stationairy point, the Bastion.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first ever Game Jam game and was made in Game Maker. I hope you enjoy it. If you have any issues with the game, drop a comment and I'll try to fix it.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T07:31:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3d/c3dfb86feada917d32fe3aacc7e1f098.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarkBuitenwerf"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
