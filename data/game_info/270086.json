Nevertheless, I tried all that I can just to submit a \"decent\" game. Win or not, it is another accomplishment in my part for actually finishing a game for the contest.</em></p>\n<p><em>I will definitely improve the game in the future. I may still use the graphics style of the first version but I will improve the other aspects like music, gameplay, title screen etc. Still not yet written in stone. Everything can change in the future release base on the feed backs that I can get.</em></p>\n<p><em>I put all my heart into this game and we should all do no matter what passion you've chosen. I dedicate this short game to my mom who passed away years ago because it's about family love. That's it for me now.</em></p>\n<p><em>I will improve the game and also the game page (Itch) in the near future.</em></p>\n<p>c(m)~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e92/e92416ace74dae21bfa49b1d3d59eafc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheWorldOfCM"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
