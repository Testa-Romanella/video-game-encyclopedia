The game is about a Jetpack with a crappy design that makes it difficult to maneuver.</p>Use Space to engage the main engine, left/right arrow keys or A/D to activate the side thursters. You'll need all three for the jetpack to take off.<p>As sad as may can be, I spent more than an hour making this \"game\", almost half of the time spent in the poor programmer art you can see. But anyways I had fun doing it so it was worth it.</p><p>Enjoy :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f1bb09b1a2f49137b0a8e31dd7540e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex T.
