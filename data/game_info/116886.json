Please check the control layout before starting the game.</p><p><strong>-</strong>You can get the <strong>Hammer</strong>, <strong>Ledge Grab</strong> and <strong>Bombs</strong>, the last of which can be exploited to find many secrets <em>sewn</em> across the game's map.<br/></p><p><strong><strong>-</strong>Bosses</strong> aren't finished, only one has sprites but no AI.</p><p><strong>-</strong>My focus right now is to make the platforming <em>fun</em> and the room layouts to flow well together. If I update again, there <em>will</em> be bosses.</p><p><strong><strong>-</strong>The game is semi-moddable</strong>, the external files in the music and demo folders can be replaced with files of the same type and name.</p><p><strong>-</strong>The game's <strong>story </strong>sucks. Something something something you're in an underground labyrinth searching for an exit and you also have to rescue your beloved friend Mayo from the evil Lizardman.</p><strong><strong>-</strong>If I get enough attention</strong> I'll update it to include the <strong>level editor</strong> I used to build the rooms for the game.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a5/3a5ca5ffa02b55997669bdfaa982773b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mayo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
