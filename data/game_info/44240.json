Your job is to fix them in time.<br/><br/>Each level features a different set of glitches that will affect the gameplay: low gravity, water physics, larger enemies, bigger explosions... and many more (there are currently over 40 glitches implemented in the game).<br/><br/>In order to help you fix all these glitches, you can unlock special powers, such as a rocket launcher, a teleporter, a gravity inverter, a shotgun, as path finder... as well as a perk, which will make your job easier, for instance by reducing damage, dropping more items, giving you more health...<br/>Picking the right powers for the right glitches can make all the difference!<br/><br/>Each level is procedurally generated and can be restarted if you fail, but will consume time. Its general layout will remain the same so you can learn from your mistakes.<br/><br/>A very early version of the game made first in the mobile category of js13k 2016, and second overall.<br/>However, the game has changed a lot since then and the js13k entry is not representative of the final product.<br/><br/>The game features both keyboard and controller support.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ee/8eefe9c5daaeb5c809c9fbfda37368dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["R\u00e9mi Vansteelandt"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["R\u00e9mi Vansteelandt"], "esrb_rating": null}
