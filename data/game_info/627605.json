Spend with them some time to discover if their anticipations are also yours. Explore their greatest fears and deepest desires and observe how their indecisiveness makes things grotesquely funny.<br/><br/>Help <strong>Cician</strong> and <strong>Cobra</strong> finish the great piece of art they're working on. Get acquainted with mysterious ways of their maniac minds and find a way to ease their ever-burning pain.<br/><br/>This game is a tribute to a classic play: Waiting for Godot. It tries to connect two very distant worlds: theatre and adventure game. By playing it you become an actor and, to some reasonable extents, the writer and the director.<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> <strong>Immersive world</strong> which is not only a theatre scene but also a fully interactive environment with people to talk, objects to manipulate and themes to investigate.<br/></li><li> <strong>Story that develops in a direction you choose</strong> - by picking dialogue lines you find most interesting.<br/></li><li> Contains lots of <strong>dark humour</strong> that hopefully induces <strong>self-reflection</strong>.<br/></li><li> In core mechanics the game resembles classic <strong>point-and-click adventure games</strong> but is extended with an <strong>advanced dialogue system</strong>, typical for RPG games.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T03:23:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/deed2626511403ce1dfed0bc9f352c81.jpg", "website": "https://microtaur.com/en/games/nothing-to-be-done", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["microtaur"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Microtaur"], "esrb_rating": null}
