Limit the angle between 0 to 45 or 50 degrees (let\u2019s test degree that feels and goods good enough)\r\n</li><li>Use the mouse to change angle from the tunnels (in blue in the map)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Elements in the maze to interact:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Factory building, on collision with it water becomes black/contaminated\r\n</li><li>House made without sanitization, on collision with it water becomes green (not healthy green more of a contaminated, rotten green)\r\n</li><li>Population is a group of houses that on collision with water cause \u201cgame over because of flood\u201d\r\n</li><li>Clean water touching dead trees \u201crevive them\u201d and count as points for score\r\n</li><li>First aid kit\u00a0 or clinic/hospital for water, when iit collisions with contaminated water it purifies it so it becomes blue again. LEVEL has only three chances to clean the water, after that, we can make the building to disappear.\r\n</li><li>Mill Wheel, it spreads the water.\r\n</li><li>Fresh water source, it is on the top left corner of the maze, it has two parts to open, they are the beaver dams, once we touch with the mouse the water will fall down by gravity.\r\n</li><li>Dam, the goal for the game it is located in the bottom right corner\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Crater, it works like a water container (like a pool but natural) and can be used by player to keep water safe temporarily, in case he is not secure where to move next or what to do.\r\n</li><li>Mountains, they look like walls from above but they are like a chain of mountains together that look like a mountain wall. They are part of the level design and act like walls\r\n</li><li>Holes, if waters pours through it it is game over.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>See below a horizontal map example illustrating all the elements for the game execution:\r\n<br/></p>\n\n<br/>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Kate - Design, 3D Art\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shammi - Programmer, Production</p>\n<p>Rommy - UI/UX, Games Design</p>\n<p>Alexis - Audio</p>\n<p>Maxim - Mentor</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/631/631ffd57c9577ffae652d86afcab6a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Romita", "ssshammi", "SonicMoths"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
