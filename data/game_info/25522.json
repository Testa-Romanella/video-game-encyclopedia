Grab your Wii Remote \n      controller and dig into 12 different foods as you compete against the \n      greatest major-league eaters in the world. This isn't just a race to \n      stuff your face-you'll need strategy to master a smorgasbord of \n      digestive attacks, defenses and counters. These include the Mega Burp, \n      Gas Attack, Antacid and more. And don't forget to keep an eye on your \n      Barf-O-Meter, because if the food hits the plate twice, you're out. \n      Unlock more than 10 characters in single-player career mode, go \n      gut-to-gut against your friends in versus mode, or compete online using \n      Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Online play supports friend codes, random \n      matchmaking and leader boards.\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
