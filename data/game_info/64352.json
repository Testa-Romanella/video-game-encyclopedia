It is created by the team of artist and developer Benjamin Poynter (3D animation-visuals, programming) and musician-DJ The Josh Craig (music, likeness). This is a project which is a merging of urban culture, poetry, how they mesh with virtual existence, and vivid city-worlds created in a single-artist pipeline while being provided help from several renown graffiti artists. The city-worlds of Doors to the City are imaginative interpretations of what Josh the character and real person sees as his domain. Soaring throughout on a skateboard, he monologues to himself in reflection of what 'the city' means to him and where is home when everywhere is always.<br/><br/>This game features World Tour (Story) mode, Free Skate, and a bonus Make-Air-Space mode for invention.<br/><br/>At special showings, available to be played on with special Tech Deck controller and visualized with The Looking Glass 3D display system.<br/><br/>Available now for upcoming Looking Glass 3D display system.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d89/d89dcb920a8e27643334256716980cbc.jpg", "website": "http://www.benjaminpoynter.com/doors-to-the-city.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Benjamin Poynter"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Benjamin Poynter", "The Josh Craig"], "esrb_rating": null}
