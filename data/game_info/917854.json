Not only fall here!</h3>Although the game is called Fall&amp;Destroy, here you can go through difficult and not very levels, jump over obstacles, destroy huge towers, run crazy rides, and of course, fall in slow motion.<br/><br/><br/><h3>What else can be dropped?</h3>Oh, a lot! For example, large and small balls that, when falling, destroy everything in their path and bounce in different directions from the \u201cbeaters\u201d with great speed. Or the cubes that are on almost every level, they are so light that they will shatter at your slightest touch, you won\u2019t even notice!<h3>Is this really a physics simulator?</h3>Of course! We have added a deep customization of the physical properties for your character to the game, which allows you to make him a \u201cfluff\u201d with dangling limbs or a strange \u201cfat man\u201d that even rides cannot push.<h3>Everything? Yes.</h3>Not really. Thanks to the flexible game settings, you can create a unique gameplay for yourself, which even we may not be aware of. So be amazing and finally complete at least one level! And we will try to add more and more new worlds!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T05:07:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/312/3126f0c0ba15860bb3feedccfc71d412.jpg", "website": "https://andreev.world/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ilya Oblomov"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Andreev Worlds"], "esrb_rating": null}
