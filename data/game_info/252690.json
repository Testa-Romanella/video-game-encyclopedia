Those have been studied already.  The Xenocetacean Institute gives you the ability to study alien whales in alien seas. \u00a0Our sector of space includes dozens of planets, each with vast seas filled with marine life, including xenocetaceans.</p>\n<p>This downloadable software gives you a way to travel to those planets, fly about those oceans, and dive into the water, to swim with the whales you find.</p>\n<p>I'm Professor Robertson, and I'll be overseeing your progress in this program. \u00a0Your job is to find, observe, track, and catalog the zenocetacean species on every planet in this sector of space. \u00a0Not easy, but you won't be alone.  Every other student has the same computer-aided tool you do, and will be looking at the exact same sector of space.</p>\n<p>So work together! \u00a0Find other researchers, and work with them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f2/0f26ec8a60ddfd85c5e1ee83980f23ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["techbear"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
