{"id": 824490, "slug": "dicey-spooky-quest", "name": "Dicey Spooky Quest", "name_original": "Dicey Spooky Quest", "description": "<p><em>Dicey Spooky Quest</em> is a haunting runner game set in a medieval world inhabited by spirits of all kinds. You play as a mysterious knight, fighting their way through terrorizing monsters to collect souls.<br/><br/>Faced at the start of the run with the Dice of Fate, randomised numbers are granted by the relics, leaving the player with the choice of what stat allocate the numbers to.  Choosing a high number for the Arrow Dice will allow higher jumping power.\r\n The more the player puts in the Heart Dice, the grander their health bar will get.\r\n As for the Sword Dice, adding points in this category will accord added amounts of a fiery super punch, an ability with great power that pushes the knight forward. The perfect tool for attacking and accessing difficult places to reach.\r\n  <br/>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Being the first game jam we\u2019ve done (except for the programmer who had one previous experience), we aimed too high for the time limit and therefore didn\u2019t manage to really expand on the gameplay mechanics and the universe we had imagined. We had plans for a merchant the player would meet at the end of each wave, where they could buy special dice to upgrade their stats to prepare for harder challenges.<br/>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>A fourth dice was thought out too, the Luck Dice, which would have heightened the probabilities of sales at the shop, more loot, and other bonuses. Finally varied enemies and platforming challenges were our next objective. We will be updating the game once the jam is done, realising some of the ideas we had envisioned, so please come check it out!</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>alt+tab</strong> = Quit Game<br/><strong>Space Bar</strong> = Jump<br/><strong>Enter Key</strong> = Attack/Confirm<br/><strong>Up/Down Arrow Keys</strong> = Select Dice<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Dicey Spooky Quest</em> was created on Game Maker Studio 2.
