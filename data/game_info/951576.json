Who knows.\u00a0<br/><br/>Can you help him to find his jester hat and end the most mundane of quests <em>ever</em>??<br/><br/>This little grey box prototype game was started in the Lockdowns. It was a training exercise for learning a new process and a new set of tools that can be purchased for Unity.\u00a0 It is a rough game... with bugs in spots! But hopefully, it will entertain some of you out there - especially as it is free. It is a game that harks back to the old point and clicks adventures of yore! <br/><br/><strong>Controls<br/></strong> Point and click without a mouse cursor. Right-click and wheel through, Use, Talk, Examine.\u00a0<br/><br/>The top bar is the inventory. <br/>Bottom left is the main menu. Make sure to save your game. <br/><br/><strong>Credits : \"This Lot\"</strong><br/>I will would like to say a special thank you to everybody that puts up with my nonsense.\u00a0 Mum, Dad, Family - the cat that sits on the shed. <br/><br/>And a big thank you to the playtesters -<br/>Ritchie, Stu, and Helen - my dearest other half. <br/><br/>This game is for education only and is not for profit.
