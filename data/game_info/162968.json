The rule is simple: get to the green grass goal without being spotted by the enemies.<br/>The enemies have a blue field of view, if you enter these and there is no block between you and the enemy, you are spotted! Unfortunately, there is no thing to do if you are spotted, just being killed and ressurect again in the begining of the current level.<br/>Sooner, I plan to add multiplayer support from 2 to 8 players. Try to beat the 10 stages offline until then. If you are good enough, send me a screenshot or video of this great achievement. Enjoy!!<br/>Features:<br/>1) Procedural level generation: each stage is unique, with a few parameters, like the number of blocks or the number of enemies;<br/>2) A green line indicates the direction to the green grass goal;<br/>3) To pause/unpause the game during offline gameplay, touch the screen with a second finger;<br/>4) Dynamic sound effects: the stealth mission happens around YOU;<br/>5) Banner ads in the top of the screen;<br/>6) Game save in the beginning of each level. If you play again and click Resume Game in the main menu, you go to the begining of the level you were when you exit the game in the previous play;<br/>7) Enjoy, share, comment, like, show your passion to the PDXSoft games!! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22ed500335f8753a382be6ae93795bbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pedrodx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
