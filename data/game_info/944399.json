{"id": 944399, "slug": "sidemv-basic-sidecroller", "name": "SideMV - Basic Sidecroller", "name_original": "SideMV - Basic Sidecroller", "description": "<p>SideMv Basic is a fully customizable demo created on RPG Maker MV, which can be used to create your own sidescroller game. This demo is unique and versatile, suitable for creating sidescroller games with a strong focus on storyline and character animations, or more action-oriented games where the character can use different abilities.</p>\n<p>The game engine is fully functional and allows for easy creation of sideview games, providing all standard features such as walking, running, and jumping.\r\n</p>\n<p>With the help of the community, we could also develop special plugins to further support this game mechanic, which unfortunately represents a minority on RPG Maker.\r\n</p>\n<p>I also want to express my gratitude to Galv and his plugins, without which this demo would never have been possible, or at least not in the way I imagined. Thank you, Galv, for your amazing work!\r\n</p>\n<p>I am very excited to see the creations that the RPG Maker community will make using this demo. I have always been a big fan of sidescroller games, and that's why I decided to make this wonderful sideview world accessible to all of you.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this submission. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on the demo, and I can't wait to share my new projects with you all in the near future!<br/></p>\n<p>Take care, game devs ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T10:07:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/686/68632053e15eb1f044ec4beca795fe82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SideMV"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
