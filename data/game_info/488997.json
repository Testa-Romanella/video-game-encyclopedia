For 1-5 players.<br/></p>\n<p>Designed for desktop play, tested with Mozilla  Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge browser. Plays best in full-screen.<br/><br/>Please note that the multiplayer lobby server used to connect peers is self-hosted, and may be frequently unavailable - Chumless mode will still work though.<br/></p>\n<p>This was a project made to try out various HTML5 technologies in order to put together a complete game (my first!) in a browser environment without relying on any external engines or plugins. Although the game itself is fairly basic, it implements peer-to-peer networking with client-side prediction, multi-threading, WebGL graphics with 3D lighting, and manages to pack all of the code and assets in at ~140Kb.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to check it out and read this, I look forward to getting the leaderboard finished and seeing all of your top scores!<br/></p>\n<p><em>--Still to come--</em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Online leaderboard</li><li>Improved visibility of where a shape will drop</li><li>Gamepad support</li><li>Stability improvements to the lobby server</li><li>Music?</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T06:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/173/173580471b0f8bbfdf313c7fc0311661.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["finlayfun"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
