Luckily it's not a long game, nor does it require backtracking for anything but the easter egg in the coffin room, so it shouldn't affect your playthrough. Consider this your \"you can, but be careful\" warning. There are no ducks in this one!</p>\n<p>I fully intend to go back and work on this again, just not with such feverish intensity as the jam provoked. But I will polish this turd until at least this first area is completely playable, and has some actual graphics, and then probably re-release it as a fresh project.<br/>I'd still really appreciate it if you played and maybe left a comment!
