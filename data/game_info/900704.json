The goal is to be the last player standing on the ground.</p>\n<p>To do so, one player needs to create a game while the others need to join thanks to the lobby code.\r\n</p>\n<p>Then, use your mouse to aim and left click to throw a powerful snowball. Shooting will make you move towards the opposite direction of the thrown snowball.<br/>Any player hit by a snowball will get a significant knockback. Pay attention to not fall over the edge !</p>\n<p>Created by :\r\nRomain Tanguy\r\nTom Saury\u00a0Antonin Lesoudier\u00a0Guillaume Jacot\u00a0Mathieu Caspar</p>\n<p>for a one-week-long school game jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T08:34:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a34e38c6e396cc34dcc683d4136a0dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheScientist14"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
