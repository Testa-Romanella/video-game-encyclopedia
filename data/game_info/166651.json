I have a story for you, and I hope you find it interesting.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Larvis is the first fully fledged game I have ever developed (disregarding personal projects). As such, much of the content may seem amateurish or unbalanced. All art and sound are pre made by others, so consider this an experiment in design and plot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is short, clocking in at around 1 hour if you were to look at everything + take your time (If you know what you're doing, its possible to beat it in under 30 minutes). Additionally, much of the story only makes sense on completion, so keep that in mind if you don't intend to play the full thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All that said, I hope you enjoy my first venture into the world of game development.\u00a0Enjoy! ~Calvin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49e/49e9e7081ce2b76ce8722d797b9e3676.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Calobbes"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
