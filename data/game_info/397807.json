Synthesizing contemporary American philosopher Ian Bogost\u2019s concept of procedural rhetoric with the materialist linguistic theory of Mikhail Bakhtin, this ultimately hypertextual and interactive article reflects on language as Bakhtin once did: as \"agent and agency\u201d (MPL 146). After detailing how the three major processes of the game coordinate spacetime, it is necessary to conclude that its kaleidoscopic nature provides new opportunities for the rendering of the geometry of thought in what is a clear refinement of the heteroglossia of the novel which Bakhtin saw as an ultimate form.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T03:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc6075462b828cd7d68256e05184d417.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jehmbo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
