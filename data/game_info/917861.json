{"id": 917861, "slug": "maze-break-2", "name": "Maze / Break", "name_original": "Maze / Break", "description": "In this game, the player finds himself in a mysterious maze full of monsters. In order to get out, he must obtain three keys guarded by bosses, as well as find the door that these keys fit into. He will be helped by the Helpers, human-like creatures that, under the influence of the protagonist's special power, will willingly join his team.<br/>The labyrinth is procedurally generated - in addition to randomly generated Helpers, you'll also find chests with a random reward - a weapon or a scroll with a spell - as well as a lot of monsters thanks to which your team will gain experience. Helpers don't listen to your direct orders - although combat is turn-based, it's automatic, and the warriors representing you will eagerly reach for the weapons and spells you equip them with.<br/><br/><strong>Maze.</strong><br/>If you manage to get out, you will level up the Maze. The Lord of the Labyrinth will gradually reveal his aces - each subsequent maze will be more difficult, by strengthening the monsters, as well as by adding new mechanics that make the game more difficult (e.g. the introduction of assassins following your team to kill you).<br/><br/><strong>Break.</strong><br/>Your actions in the maze will be judged, whether you manage to get out or fall to the onslaught of monsters. You will be rewarded with points for your achievements, and when you collect enough of them, you will increase the level of Maze Break. Each level unlocks new mechanics that help in the game (e.g. unlocking the ability to upgrade weapons, or increasing the food limit to facilitate exploration).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T05:17:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/282/2820c76370fc9bb973a25d7940b263a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tehawar"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Tehawar"], "esrb_rating": null}
