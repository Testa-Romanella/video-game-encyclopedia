The area holds the sight of a future you have no idea of, all you can do is use the limited time you have to explore or gather information. Trying to explore grants more options, but those options mean nothing if you never gain information from them.</p>\n<p>This was the game idea I wanted to create for my next D&amp;D session, I thought it would be a really cool vision option to gleam information. But on saturday sadly I got stuck on a bug for 8 hours and I did not quite recover :P so it's just visuals and pretties now. I hope you still enjoy the experience and when it's further along I will update it to be complete.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T09:19:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a86/a863b3ff64c67fac174d915970fd98c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RayRobinVermeulen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
