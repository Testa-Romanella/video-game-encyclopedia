You controll a bomb-laying rabbit with a grappling hook. Since this game runs on PHONTON PUN 2, you do not need a local connection for players, this works flawlessly online.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>** == CONTROLS== **</strong><br/></p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - Walk <br/>F - Kick Bomb (reaches 3 blocks distance) <br/>Mouse 1 - Use Grappling hook, aim with your mouse <br/><strong><br/>IMPORTANT: <br/>Bombs do NOT spawn under you, they spawn in front of you.</strong><br/>As part of a game design decision, you can kick bombs immediately after spawning them which is a tactical advantage. This game is focused on combat and dodging abilities. Get as many powerups as possible and dominate the field.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>** ========== CREDITS ========== ** </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Idea: Jonas Walter &amp; Oziel Esparza <br/>Programming:  Jonas Walter <br/>Artwork &amp; Game Sprites:  Jonas Walter <br/>Concept Art &amp; Game Sprites:  Oziel Esparza <br/></p>\n<p>- SPECIAL THANKS - Imaginary Badger Crew, my friends and family! <br/>Inquietus for letting me use their music! <br/>[https://soundcloud.com/inquietus] <br/></p>\n<p>- Unity Asset Store - <br/>Exit Games Photon Networking <br/>HONETi Flat Dark Themed GUI / UI Kit <br/>JMO Cartoon FX Remaster <br/>All asset licenses have been acquired legally. <br/></p>\n<p>- SFX Sources- <br/>zapsplat, freesound.org, Adobe Audition Creative Commons assets, YouTube sound effect library, Taira Komori's free sfx</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T09:39:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a18/a18ad667fcfed43e31cc4b973b1ceab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sidpoke"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
