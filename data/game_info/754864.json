A turn-based platformer roguelike. Ascend a tower of randomly limbed cyborg monsters in your hi-jump battle mech while upgrading your arsenal and jumping and attacking from mid-air.</p>\n<p>Made for the 2022 7DRL game jam in 7.3 days. Oops.</p>\n<p>Pretty buggy but playable and complete with an ending.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\nMOVEMENT\r\n<ul>\n<li>Left/Right to turn, walk, shove enemies, or jump up small steps of one or two tiles.</li>\n<li>. or G to skip a turn.</li>\n<li>Up to plan a jump. Pick the arc and press Enter. </li><li>Circles show where you'll get a turn in midair.<ul><li>The midair turn can be used to to change direction or target and fire on an enemy.</li><li>J or Down to continue the fall without changing direction or firing.</li></ul></li><li> While picking a jump path:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Left/Right changes selection between groups of jump paths with the same destination X coordinate. </li> <li>Up/Down changes the selected jump path from within the currently selected group</li>\n<li>, [  (previous) or  . ] (next) cycles through the available paths sequentially.</li> </ul></li><li>P performs a random panic jump, likely with more power than you can usually use. Does nothing if it can't find a spot to land.</li></ul>\r\nINVENTORY\r\n<ul>\n<li>I to access inventory.</li>\n<li>E/U to (E)quip and (U)nequip weapons and U to (U)se healing items.</li></ul>\r\nTARGETING AND FIRING\r\n<ul><li>F or Enter to enter the targeting interface.</li>\n<li>, [ PgUp (previous) or  . ] PgDown (next) cycles through the available targets.</li>\n<li>Press 1/2/3/4 to select/deselect weapons to fire. Text in red indicates the weapon cannot be fired.</li>\n<li>Enter to fire.</li></ul>\r\nHINTS\r\n<ul>\n<li>Weapon qualities, including the starting weapon, are highly random, so you should examine their stats. To compensate, you get less starting HP if the start weapon does more damage.</li><li> Weapons with more damage have more cooldown.</li>\n<li>Fire different weapons based on situation and cooldown. You can fire up to four at once, but that's probably overkill.</li>\n<li>There's no falling damage.</li>\n<li>Your facing direction costs a turn to change! It doesn't affect anything except your ability to shove enemies or walk away.</li>\n<li>There's no penalty/bonus to damage or aim when you're in midair (though that was the plan!), but you need to jump to stay away from enemies, which are mostly melee.</li>\n<li>There are 10 floors.</li>\n<li>Enemies with guns drop them when they die.</li>\n<li>Shoving an enemy with their back to a wall does extra damage.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T17:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d2/6d2726be9800a46a1f227b77ee6fbd19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["voxelate", "Seilburg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
