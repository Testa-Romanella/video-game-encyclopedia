At least that's what your friends thought\u00a0when they decided to go\u00a0wandering into a mysterious silent retreat in the woods near town.\u00a0 You could use some time alone for meditading\u00a0and going on an instrospective experience, after all, there's no talking, no gesturing, and no escape.<br/><br/>In Aphonia, your goal is to explore and investigate the location, so that you can understand what is happenning at the place and get you and your friends out of it. The game's mechanics consist on walking and interacting with clues and objects to make progress throughout the story. The controls are as followed:<br/><br/>-WASD:\u00a0 Walk;<br/>-F: Interact;<br/>-Ctrl: Crouch;<br/>-Mouse: Look around.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/178/178296e746596bae3316909793065da7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thadeu Alonso", "IAmPaullo", "stupidere", "Passarynho"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
