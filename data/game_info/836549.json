Every weapon and ship is different and fits some niche. Tailor your arsenal to maximize the fun you're having, as there isn't just one path to victory.<br/><br/><h3>Fun Difficulty</h3>The enemies you'll be facing aren't static. They'll shoot at you, charge at you and in general try to give you a bad time, but the game isn't out there to crush you... unless you want it to try. Every perk in the <strong>Command Center</strong> will be counter-acted by an enemy perk of your choice - strategize to gain the biggest advantage, or create absolute bedlam and try to survive. After that, how well will you fare in other universes, where the invaders are stronger?<br/><br/><h3>Plenty Of Unlocks</h3>Obtain achievements, upgrade your starting stats, unlock different ships, rank up in the <strong>Command Center</strong> and climb up the Multiverse ladder to become the ultimate Hero!<br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>6 Unique Ships<br/></li><li>30 Perks that heavily shake up the game<br/></li><li>15 Modifiers from bosses fitting into many playstyles<br/></li><li>Many cool Talents, Weapons, Upgrades and Meta-Upgrades<br/></li><li>Quick playthroughs that last around 12-18 minutes each</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T06:04:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda8f02f9f40b2dbb5d525be0d64c750.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emily Grey & Eve Grey"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Emily Grey & Eve Grey"], "esrb_rating": null}
