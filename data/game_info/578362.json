If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose. When you win a stage, the game will take you back to the title screen / level select, but will save your score. Aim for the highest score!<br/>SCORING : All bricks are worth the same - 1 point. If you destroy a brick with your power wave, though, you will get 2 points.\u00a0<br/>EDGE and POWER WAVE: The Bloxx Empire is edgy. Striking a brick on its edge will grant you an edge point and charge your power wave, but the effect on your ball can be unpredictable.
