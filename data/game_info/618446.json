I am very sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>BOWEL BUGS SOMETIMES, PRESS R TO RESET (SORRY, IT WORKED FINE IN UNITY EDITOR BUT IS BUGGY IN WEBGL BUILD)</strong></p>\n<p>Actually, it bugs a lot. I tried a mechanic to reset it, but there was not enough time after I realized the final build runs buggy in webGL. I am sorry :(</p>\n<p><strong>PLAY IN FULL SCREEN SO ALT KEY WON'T STOP THE GAME (SORRY)</strong></p>\n<p>I actually forgot ALT key in a browser game is a bad idea. Play in fullscreen to circumvent this problem.</p>\n<p><strong>HAVE FUN!
