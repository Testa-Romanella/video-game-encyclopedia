Ronnie's Bubbles", "description": "<p>Ronnie's Bubbles is a simple but challenging bubble-bouncing game where your goal is to reach Pluto.</p>\n<p>At first it will seem difficult, but soon, you'll be getting there no problem, and you will be entirely bored with the game!</p>\n<p>I\u00a0made this game all on my own, because while I draw comics for a living (that you can find at whompcomic.com), my first love has always been video games.</p>\n<p>A successful run of a game is usually going to be less than 10 minutes, so please only give what you think is worth it for such a short time. (Or better yet, play it first before giving any money!)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little thing I made!</p><p>Music by Teknoaxe:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/user/teknoaxe</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e6/7e685b36a37109cdb374cd42a2491597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["whomp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
