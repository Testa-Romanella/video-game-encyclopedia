With over 10,000 unique levels and 4 bosses governing each one with their own set of weapons, every new attempt will be a new experience. <br/><br/>RSV2 was made for instant drop-in-and-play action; there's nothing between you and the core experience. It's a distilled and efficient platforming playground with infinitely increasing difficult, multiple playable characters, boss battles, powerups, and probably lots and lots (and lots) of dying.<br/><br/>Doc DuBrane is gearing up once again to save Nucleusport. After a crushing defeat, the reckless alien Prince FaceBox and his minions have relocated to the in-construction Sine Wave Tower, the tallest building ever (almost) built. <br/><br/>Their heinous mission? To dump all the radioactive waste from their own planets on an already highly-irradiated Earth. Doc, using the genius invention the Prisma Cannon, is the only one who can climb the tower and stop those stupid jerks. So get out your haz-mat suit, finish whatever it is you were doing, and get ready to get radical.<br/><br/>Main Features:<br/><ul><li> Instant, endless platforming<br/></li><li> Infinitely increasing difficulty<br/></li><li> Over 10,000 unique levels<br/></li><li> 5 playable characters<br/></li><li> 4 radical boss fights<br/></li><li> A killer soundtrack by Bit Level Up<br/></li><li> Gamepad support</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-01T23:37:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e06/e064a02ba1c3840b7c293664b43aca9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.29, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 138, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Autonomic Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["New Reality Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
