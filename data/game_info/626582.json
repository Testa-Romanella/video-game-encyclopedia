However, I do have another one coming soon with better controls and polish.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is my first game, so it is very basic. But this is just a test run to get my foot in the door, as I plan on doing much better stuff later on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is just a simple platformer. Use A and D to move, and W is to jump. Esc is to pause, and P is to start the game. There are 30 levels you must get through in order to beat the game.</p>\n<p>Your character only has bottom collision, so you are able to travel up walls when you hit them. This can be a help or a hindrance, and different levels will show you how this works.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T07:51:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04d/04dc6c4a13d3038e43bd4c9c09f216ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joshgibsongames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
