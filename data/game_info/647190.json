Check out his art: https://www.deviantart.com/pacci-d</p>\n<p>Now incorporating a mini-cutscene of sorts (pay attention to those lil' units in the background), it seems to be raining some kind of magical berry! Step into their line of fire, and eat as many as you can. Lucina's belt can't hold forever...<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>R to restart (reload the game/page if you want to change options)<br/>A &amp; D: Step left or right<br/>Click the button on the left corner of the warning screen to toggle hyper size (Lucina's max belly size will be much larger and grow faster. Perhaps with hyper mode on, the berries expand after being eaten?)<br/>Click the tiny berry in the background at the start to expedite the mini-cutscene.</p>\n<p>Thanks again to Pacci-d for granting permission to use this artwork!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T06:39:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/335/3352a137c24720b11e83b47f1002e8b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Blunder Jub"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
