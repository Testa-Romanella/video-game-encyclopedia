The game deals with the evolution of a universe grown below the cranial vault of a god which falls asleep. The god\u2019s brain is an equivalent of a solar system, and planets are its neurons. The player will have to turn the celestial bodies into full-fledged anthropomorphic creatures endowed with mind and identity.
