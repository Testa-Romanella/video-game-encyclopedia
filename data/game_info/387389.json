{"id": 387389, "slug": "haggis", "name": "Haggis", "name_original": "Haggis", "description": "From the green hills of the Scottish highlands comes a card game stuffed full of fun.  The goal is simply to play all of your cards first.  But beware, hidden in the misty crags are subtle strategies that require mastery of tricky combinations, wild cards and... \"bombs\". <br/><br/>Sean Ross designed Haggis over a number of years, extensively testing over thousands of hands to create a very engaging and balanced game.<br/><br/>The iOS edition was tastefully crafted to allow you to play 2-3 player matches of Haggis against AI players, with automated scoring and built in reserve mechanics to allow you to sort and manage your hand.  You can play a short game to 250 points, or a longer game to 350 points--whichever suits your mood.  And the great thing is the ability to pick up and continue play wherever you left off if you need to take a break, or get back to work.<br/><br/><br/>Here is just some of what people are saying about Haggis:<br/><br/>San Francisco Chronicle<br/>\"Haggis, created by Sean Ross, boasts elegant design, crystal-clear rules and enough strategic subtlety to reward repeated play, all without putting it beyond the reach of a canny preteen.\"<br/><br/>The Rumpus Room<br/>\"Every aspect of the game feels very considered and polished.\"<br/><br/>Matt's Board Game Back Room<br/>\"... Haggis doesn't TRY to be Tichu - it just tries to be a good game in-and-of itself and has it's own subtleties and strategies which provides a new challenge with the same level of tension and excitement.\"<br/><br/>Hiew's Boardgame Blog<br/>\"Fans of traditional card games definitely should give Haggis a try.\"<br/><br/><br/>Designed for iPhone 4 and iPad, we hope you will enjoy the beautiful graphics, animation, and sound effects of the game.  Designed by Sean Ross and initially published by Indie Boards &amp; Cards, it has been brought to the iPad by IQ Foundry--another independent game publishing company.<br/><br/>If you have any feedback for our team, please click the website link below and fill out our contact form.
