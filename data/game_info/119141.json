I don't want to shoulder the blame onto people actively opposing authoritarianism \u2013 I am one of them \u2013 but I think the central message is still a strong one. The people voting for these abrupt and dangerous changes aren't all bad. In many cases they're just people who've been left behind by the system we all live in. That's why the game focuses around doing good deeds in your community.</p><p>\u2013 Dan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c6/3c6fded70ec2bc9e705f89a777b4918c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chequered Ink"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
