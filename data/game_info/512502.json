You just fly up or down, trying to get through the gaps in between the\u00a0obstacles.</p>\n<p>Many game developers say that the first game you should try to make is flappy bird. Of course I didn't do this, so I made a dozen unfinished projects. So eventually I decided Id make a game inspired by flappy bird, and actually finish it to a fully playable state. So here it is, and feel free to leave any feedback, it is always appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:42:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86d/86d6b0fdce0df50ccab8ce46cfeb6714.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Samieh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
