The game is less polished and focused but far more ambitious. I\u00a0tried a bunch of things I've never done before in games development which means things are a bit buggier though more feature complete.</p><p>There are bugs, there are issues and the gameplay loop could be better but I was trying a lot of new things to me and between game breaking bugs and figuring stuff out I just didn't have the time to fix them.</p><p>Regardless, thank you for trying it out!</p><p><strong>Here's how to play:</strong><br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>\u2022WASD/Arrow keys/Control pad to move</p><p>\u2022Space/Left Click/A Button on controller to interact or use\u00a0</p><p>\u2022Escape to pause\u00a0\u2022Left click to interact with menus<br/></p><p><strong>Goal:</strong> Give your favourite NPC 3 gifts to win at life. Both require a present matching the colour of shirt they are wearing</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong><strong>:</strong> Grab your tools off the floor and get to farming. Use the hoe on farmland tiles to till the soil and the watering can on tilled soil to water it. Plant seeds on tilled soil and water planted crops to make them grow. It takes 3 days for crops in watered soil to finish growing and be harvestable. Be careful as some farmland tiles are fickle and will not allow you to farm them!</p><p>Take harvested crops to the big box next to your farmhouse and interact with it to sell them. Take your money to the shop to the right and buy more seeds to farm with.\u00a0If you have enough, you may buy gifts that can be given to NPCs with a heart next to them.</p><p>You have 24 hours each day to farm, shop and do your tasks and each day lasts 30 seconds.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>New things I worked on:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 A\u00a0settings menu with key rebinding that can\u00a0 be reset to default,\u00a0a volume slider and the ability to choose which tile targeting system you wish to use\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022Pausing with a built in settings menu\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022A hotbar with its own selection cursor and the use of an array to track inventory\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022A shop\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022Tracking everything in regards to progress, time and date,\u00a0and farming states between scenes\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022Using a new app to create audio with\r\n</p><p><strong>Issues:</strong></p><p>\u2022Some farm tiles cannot be farmed on</p><p>\u2022There are graphical bugs between scenes</p><p>\u2022Some error and tip messages will cause the boxes for them to persist indefinitely</p><p>\u2022The volume slider does not work well if at all<br/></p><p><strong>Features that had to be cut:</strong></p><p>\u2022The ability to just hold down a button to be able to keep using a tool or plant as you moved about.
