Centuries later, instead of watching a live battle between two warriors, the spectators follow a computer game in which the skills of human reaction take on the power of modern computers.<br/>In 2077, Bogdan is one of the lucky ones - a streamer, freed from the heavy intensive work of mining minerals. His task is to entertain the public, exposing himself to danger in battles with powerful opponents and formidable monsters. <br/>Not in every game do you have to see it through until the very end as in this one. You must throw yourself into the struggle for your own life, but the only tool you will have is the untrained,inert body of an elderly streamer. How long will you survive?<br/>Bogdan is essentially a Boss Rush Mode, in which the difficulty increases with each level - each Boss will be a test of the player\u2019s stamina and dexterity.Unique game mechanics:<ul><li>A clumsy character whose stamina hardly allows him to walk two metres. Forget about jump kicks, double jumps and, in general, jumps.<br/></li><li>Myopia caused by constant focusing on the monitor will not allow you to hit the enemies with accuracy.<br/></li><li>Any injury greatly affects your health scale as it has already been worsened by a sedentary lifestyle.</li></ul>If you are tired of the immense amount looting, armoring and the ability to dye your hair in the game, which only distracts you from the gameplay, then we are waiting for you. You will no longer have to think about how to dress your hero. You are simply dressed as a sucker.Key features:<ul><li>Each Boss has its own history and combat tactics.<br/></li><li>Enclosed, gloomy battle arenas that can not be abandoned without killing the Boss.<br/></li><li>A unique character skills system (perks).<br/></li><li>Complex Melee System.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f04c46027afdab43da147c469597bb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 459, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TushaWorks"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TushaWorks"], "esrb_rating": null}
