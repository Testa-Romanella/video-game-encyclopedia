{"id": 915819, "slug": "excrive", "name": "EXCRIVE", "name_original": "EXCRIVE", "description": "<p>My submission to the GDS Winter Jam 2022/23, with my theme being \"Isolation\"</p>\n<p>Banished. Starving. Alone. Accused of a crime you did not commit, you have been banished to a deserted island known as Excrive. With only 2 days worth of rations, you must find a way off of the island before you starve to death. If you manage to find 3 logs and a sail you can repair the boat that took you to the island, and escape with your life. But hurry, time is running short.</p>\n<p>In order to survive long enough to escape\u00a0you need to find food on the island, such as apples or coconuts. You're not the first to be banished here, maybe you can find the boats that took others here, and find some supplies there? But beware, rumours speak of\u00a0monsters that inhabit the island. Perhaps you could craft some sort of weapon to protect yourself, such as a slingshot? If ever you run out of rations, health, or sanity, then you will die.</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<ul><li>WASD /\u00a0D-Pad\u00a0- Movement in the menu / game</li><li>RETURN / A Button - Selection in the menu / game</li></ul>\r\nASSETS USED:\r\n<ul><li>Kenney Font Package - Kenney</li><li>Pirate Pack - Kenney</li><li>Grayscale\u00a0Icons -\u00a0S\u00f8ren Nielsen</li><li>Game Icons - GameIcons.net</li><li>Ornamented Arrow -\u00a0Nallebeorn</li><li>Key Virtue - SushiHueDesign</li><li>Wild Land -\u00a0Fato_Shadow</li><li>Card Game Sounds - HaelDB</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T11:43:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e3/5e33064263d951944f745b6131a52ba6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donian"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
