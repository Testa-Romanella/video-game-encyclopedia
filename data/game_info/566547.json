Pick from 3 options, then do it again, and again, and again...  Make the best out of a bad situation. Do it as quickly as you can because time is the most valuable resource at your disposal.  Space Choice: Data Analyzer is free.  It's just a little project we wanted to share with whoever had a few extra minutes on their hands.  Thank you for checking it out.<br/><br/><strong>First, pick the type of ship you want</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Secondly, pick the type of weapon to equip to your ship</strong><br/><br/><br/>Then the ship is sent to the front lines to automatically fight for you.<br/><br/><strong>Once in a while, you'll get a permanent upgrade.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>And once in a while, you'll get a combat pick that could drastically change the outcome of the battle.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Time is a factor</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the early levels, you'll have plenty of time to make your choices as you learn what everything does.  But as you advance throughout the stages, eventually you'll reach the game's natural speed, which allows for only 4 seconds per choice.<br/><br/>This game is really about looking at numbers really quickly, over and over again.  However, there are times when strategic choices come into play, especially when dealing with point defense weapons, nukes, and other weapon types.<br/><br/>Additionally, planning out a strategy for your permanent upgrades early on will help you win in the late game.  Actually, I'm not sure if the game is beatable without planning your permanent upgrades.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T03:57:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc3/cc3934a0335011888f9f20338181a1be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 117}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 431, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silver Dollar Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silver Dollar Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
