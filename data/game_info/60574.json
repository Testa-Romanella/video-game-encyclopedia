PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF GAME FUNCTIONING.The Game<br/>As a mechanic you and your dragon explore what is left of humanity's last refuge: a fleet of huge flying ships which hover over an endless ocean. To survive in this post-apocalyptic world you have to scavenge your surroundings and defend yourself against creatures and other players. You have to build a base, improve it and learn. Equipment and tower upgrades help you to get you own food, water and electricity supply which is essential for survival in DARCO.<br/><br/>You encounter mechanical beasts in the world. These creatures can be converted and used to your own benefit. You also come across hostile dragons that you have to combat. The dragons, belonging to different elements, can be bred though and make it easier to explore and fight.The Story<br/>After the greatest human invention, mankind was at the peak of its civilization, being able to create all sorts of technical wonders. Then, however, a horrible disaster struck, that flooded the earth and rendered the few remaining patches of land uninhabitable.<br/>Foreseeing this tragic event, the greatest engineers built habitats with ecosystems to their liking in the form of huge, flying ships. This fleet, being able to escape the dangers of the flood, would become the peaceful home of mankind for centuries.<br/><br/>This changed when hordes of dragons began attacking the ships, and thus the Dragon War began. Through the ingenuity of humankind, mechanical beasts were created resembling animals, which were living in these habitats centuries back, to combat their new foes. This wasn't enough, though: humanity fought until no warriors were left, and the few who survived were left to one basic principle: Every man for himself.<br/><br/>Humanity was defeated, the fleet scattered, but the automated factories inside the ships continued producing beasts. With no continued maintenance throughout the chaos of the war, errors in production were bound to occur. The beasts malfunctioned and began attacking everything living and breathing.<br/><br/>You are one of the few survivors, a mechanic, of what was once a great Victorian civilization. As your day starts and you are out completing an important quest, you come across a young dragon. You pity the injured cub, so you decide to save it and from this moment on it never leaves your side, and you eventually realize: this dragon is your new companion. Take care of it, and you will grow stronger together.<br/>Game Mechanics<br/>When you arrive in the world of DARCO, you are given a choice of which elemental dragon you would like to start with. This starter dragon is your companion, never leaving your side throughout the game. That doesn't stop you though from creating dragons and your own small dragon army.<br/><br/>The mechanic beasts inhabiting the ships are a continuous danger together with other players. With your skills you are able to refactor some of them for your needs, even though only for a limited time.<br/><br/>You have to fight starvation and dehydration as your greatest enemy. Since you are not able to come back into the ship due to a lock down, you must learn to hunt and build yourself a home. Survival gets easier as soon as you can build your tower and with that better equipment. You can't hide in your fortress though, since you need to explore other ships to find new resources and confront the growing dangers.<br/><br/>Play solo or team up with a friends into alliances, to put the world at your feet!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff57399ab699b8b9259573d78df355c3.jpg", "website": "http://tp-studios.de", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 451, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TP-STUDIOS"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TP-STUDIOS"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
