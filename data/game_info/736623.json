All other responses mean that you\u00a0think it is not his wisdom.</p>\n<p>Each phrase is allocated a number of Newton points. If a phrase scores 18 points or more, it means it is\u00a0attributed to Newton. As words always score the same number of points during each game, it should\u00a0become easier to work out which phrases are attributed to Newton as the game progresses.</p>\n<p>Your aim is for your wisdom score to be as close to 100% by the end of the game as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Code and documentation:</p>\n<p>Lines 1-3 \u2013 Game data. U is set to the number of phrases.</p>\n<p>Line 4 \u2013 String array variables holding each part of the phrase (S$,V$ and A$). N stores a random number\u00a0of points per word so that the phrase's 'Newton points' can be calculated using function FNA().</p>\n<p>Lines 4-5 \u2013 Initialise game data and clear the screen.</p>\n<p>Line 6 \u2013 Generate a random phrase and calculate the number of Newton points it has (stored in numeric\u00a0variable O).</p>\n<p>Lines 6-7 \u2013 Print out the phrase and ask if it is attributed to Newton.</p>\n<p>Line 8 \u2013 If the guess is \u201cY\u201d and O&gt;17 or if it is \u201cN\u201d and O&lt;18 add one to the score and tell the player they\u00a0have given the right answer. Branch to line 10.</p>\n<p>Line 9 \u2013 Reached only if the guess is incorrect. If the guess was that the phrase was attributed to\u00a0Newton, tell the player who really said it (Einstein, of course).</p>\n<p>Line 10 \u2013 Display the number of Newton points the phrase was worth, to enable the player to guess\u00a0better next time. Display the wisdom percentage of the player. If this isn't the twentieth phrase display\u00a0the next one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T05:31:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b46/b469fe9ec4c627e2dde91918856b9650.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
