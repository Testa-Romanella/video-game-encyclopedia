Not at all!<br/><br/>Help the gunner destroy the enemy castle in over 70 levels and in four different areas.</p>\n<p>By adjusting the tilt angle and the firepower of the cannon, you'll be able to hit the target accurately. If the situation gets a little more difficult, you can use the coins you earn to purchase various cannon extras, such as an Exploding Cannonball? or an Aiming Aid? Decide wisely what to spend your coins on.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>And if the castle seems unreachable, place up to eight different platforms in the playing field to redirect the cannonball to the desired location.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Watch out for countless obstacles that stand in the way of the cannonball and the enemy castle.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Collect long lost artifacts on your journey and display them in the gallery.</p>\n<p>The faster you complete the levels and the fewer cannonballs and platforms you need, the better your score will be. Only with a successful level completion you will reach the next level.</p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T07:52:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703835a43e3ca1a0cfa0cd96a0444bba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Polygonya"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
