I'm uploading it here mostly for \"archival\" purposes so that people can see the stages in the system's development.<br/></p>\n<p>In this demo, a single \"chunk\" prefab consisting of two floors, two ramps, and some decorations is instantiated in each chunk and either hidden or rotated in increments of 90 degrees to give a degree of randomization to the overall structure. More recent experiments have investigated having chunks contain other types of objects, such as land mines, trees and clouds, or single architectural elements, all of which can be seen in other demos on my portfolio page.</p>\n<p>As is the case in the other early demos, the concept of this demo is simple: explore the procedural building. Follow the small white square to find an Easter egg.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Left mouse and drag to control the camera view<br/>W/A/S/D to run<br/>Left shift to walk slowly<br/>Space to jump<br/>The \"Refresh\" button regenerates the building, but does not change the pseudorandom seed, so it should appear as though nothing has happened.<br/>The \"ReSeed\" button changes the seed and then regenerates the building in a new shape.<br/>The \"Follow Camera\" toggle controls whether the chunk system follows the player's position to create an endless structure; toggle it off to stop new chunks from generating, making it possible to reach the \"end\" of the structure.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T09:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05c/05c576336c1bc4ebf46337d9924f42d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["problemecium"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
