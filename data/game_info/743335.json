Players are given limited resources and weaponry and are tasked with either killing or capturing the entity before it hunts them down. Players will need to choose their battles wisely as they prepare for their next inevitable engagement with the monster while ensuring it does not find them first.</p>\n<p>Note: There is a level select menu with multiple levels, however, these are test levels used for level design testing purposes. They do not have the full capabilities of the main level (accessed through the Play Game button) and may not necessarily work.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>Left-click - fire weapon / use equipment</p>\n<p>Q and E - lean left or right (respectively)</p>\n<p>Left Shift - sprint</p>\n<p>F - pickup items</p>\n<p>Ctrl - crouch</p>\n<p>1 2 3 - inventory selection</p>\n<p>4 - use medical stim</p>\n<p>Tab (hold) - view tablet (scroll wheel to switch view)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T11:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/067/067ee87c23e8ebf2912b56bb3dc148d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["John Reichenbach"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
