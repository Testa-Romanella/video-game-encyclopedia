Our invasion force is landing on the beaches of Normandy.  As a pilot you will be flying a Lockheed Lightning.  Your mission is to provide air cover for the landing craft.  Shoot down all the enemy aircraft you can before they have a chance to bomb the landing craft.  There are 15 landing craft - you have to shoot down all the enemy planes and insure the landing craft land on the beach successfully.  You will score points by shooting down the enemy planes.  You lose Health points by being shot by the enemy and colliding with enemy planes.  You MUST protect the majority of the landing craft to successfully complete the mission. Earn either a Gold, Silver or Bronze medal based upon your performance.  Your last \"5\" scores are saved during the game - can you beat your last highest score? <br/><br/>Good Luck Pilot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/342/342a5a794da125b2457ec522e9bc9f4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lake Dog Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
