Each map is randomly generated and each game takes ~15 minutes to play. You will likely lose most of the time.</p>\n<p>Keyboard commands:</p>\n<p>q - move NW</p>\n<p>w - move N</p>\n<p>e - Move NE</p>\n<p>a - move W</p>\n<p>d - move E</p>\n<p>z - move SW</p>\n<p>x - move S</p>\n<p>c - move SE</p>\n<p>v - center on character</p>\n<p>arrow keys move around map.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<p>- Sometimes, on startup the screen goes blank. You can command tab out and in and this fixes it sometimes. It may come back and no user input is taken. You can test by hitting \"Load\" and if nothing happens, just quit and re open. This mostly happened when starting from Xcode.</p>\n<p>- Going full screen and back causes it to stop drawing. I do not know why. These are both API issues that I\u00a0am going to have to contact Apple about help for</p>\n<p>- A crash to desktop is possible, but I cannot re create and happens rarely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- I tested this on two machines: a 2015 m5 and a 2014 i7. It was significantly slower in between turns on the m5 than the 2014 i7.</p>\n<p>My email is:\u00a0peoplesrepublicofgames@gmail.com</p>\n<p>For $50 I will add any (non obscene) 256x256 game piece as a character you want.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T09:25:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/419/419c823ed254d858d3c24c6c05917661.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["stratozyck"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
