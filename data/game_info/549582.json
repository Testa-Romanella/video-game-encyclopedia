Through the action of mapping the space, the player enters a virtual trust-fall with the game. In truth, I'm bad at trust falling. Maybe I made this game so I could trust fall with my laptop in a way that didn't involve crushing it... Casadastra contains 7 areas, as well as objects to interact with - sometimes they speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>ALSO, QUIETLY:<br/></em>Casadastra is a game about an event that changed my trajectory as a human person.\u00a0It's also about night walking, my home town, powerlines, the complicated feeling of a place, wetness and dryness in relation to brain-space,\u00a0the textural relationship between red-brown\u00a0and the deep\u00a0night sky,\u00a0 gesturing in complicated ways at myself,\u00a0gesturing in simple ways at people I know,\u00a0 gesturing with varying intentions towards the player, showing off all the things I can do on my laptop, my aspirations towards the future of video-games... <br/><br/>It's texture, really.\u00a0 All texture - spiralling, moving - the texture of space and of time, looking back, trying to look forward, where I've\u00a0stood, where I might stand again... It's also just about a video game. I hope you will enjoy this thing I've put together.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Warm, frightening, cold, homely, harsh atmosphere</li><li>Non-combat dungeon-crawler-style\u00a0tile-based exploration</li><li>Pen\u00a0&amp; Paper mapping encouragement</li><li>Truly cryptic dialogue perpetrated by vague, warped spectres</li><li>Hazy boardwalks, silent\u00a0offices, flooding houses, multiple buzzing frequencies</li><li>Original music and field recording by Earth Treader Fen</li><li>A slow, mysterious pace</li><li>Verdant imprints of the real earth</li></ul>\n\n<p>Mantra-like, Casadastra</p>\n<p><strong>Versions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Soundtrack:\u00a0https://earthtreaderfen.bandcamp.com/album/casadastra-sound\u00a0(NOT YET RELEASED)<br/></p>\n<p><em>What is the difference between Local and Linked Versions?<br/></em>When you purchase the Upwards Warping Edition, you get access to both Local and Linked variants.Local contains, within the download, all bonus content.\u00a0<br/>If the 5gb file-size of that download is unreasonable to download due to your circumstances,\u00a0 Linked supplies links to online versions of all bonus content, which you can view online as you please, or download piecemeal.</p>\n\n<em>Casadastra Releases 31/01/2021</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T10:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa7/aa774ef9b48831930ac21697a0010357.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MiloSoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
