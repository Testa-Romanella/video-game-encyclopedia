The collision sent thousands of small fragments into orbit that lingered for years, bringing the question of dangers of orbital debris to the public.</p>\n\n<p>This is a little one day doodle-simulation that is an attempt to recreate that event.

It's possible to raise the number but line drawing is actually the bottleneck.\u00a0The simulation uses Kepler equations, the only forces calculated are\u00a0Earth's gravity and atmospheric drag.\u00a0The spreading of debris\u00a0after collision uses Box-Muller distribution.</p>\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>002:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Added [ and ] for changing debris size</li><li>Camera moves in FixedUpdate now to prevent jittering</li><li>Help text hidden by default - press F1 to show it</li></ul>\n<p>I've removed the web gl version as it was running out of memory.
