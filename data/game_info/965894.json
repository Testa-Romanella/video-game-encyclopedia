Unfortunately, every ten years a giant storm passes through the Shroomy Isles and reduces everything to little more than mycelium and a couple of berry brushes. As the tenth storm looms upon the Isles, the first little storm cloud puts a big idea in the tiniest shroom's head: Unite the shrooms! Fight back against the weather!!<br/><br/>March of Shrooms is a frenetic, cheery crowd brawler that chronicles the tiny shroom's epic odyssey to unite shroomkind against the coming storm!
