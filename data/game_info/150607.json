This is a demonstration of Zero Insanity's first game, Unbeatable Breeze, a parkour game that tests your reflex and judgement as you jump long gaps and run walls, all to make it to the end. Press Z to jump, press the up arrow key when near a purple wall to run the wall, and use the left and right arrow keys to move. This game is quite challenging, since you can not move in mid-air, which means you have to calculate your speed carefully before jumping!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/291/291d57a53d45023f2a22cf5e0c6b573f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zero Insanity"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
