Kosolov is a highly controlled and secretive society. It's an industrialized nation. With overwhelming authority and a devotion to its leaders, the citizens endlessly work to death. A hard divide between the secretive upper society and the majority brainwashed working class ensures continuation. Effectively shunned from the rest of the world, leaders of Kosolov have been free to fast-track their unethical scientific experiments to enhance their tyrannical military capabilities and workforce. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo create the ultimate controllable and mindless workforce Kosolov had put in place a plan to revive the dead and set them back to work - benefitting from already high mortality rate. Scientists have attempted mechanical implants, regenerative biomass, and a host of bizarre experiments. With numerous unforeseen consequences resulting in a catastrophic disaster, the only thing left to do is battle your way out of the city. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnomalous in current early access contains the first episode of the game which contains 10 levels.
