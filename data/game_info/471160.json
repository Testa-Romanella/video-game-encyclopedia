The catch is that you have to shoot time bombs that freeze time around the explosion. You can <strong>heavily damage enemies while they are frozen</strong>. If the enemy isn't frozen you will deal very little damage. Every level you will have to use a different weapon (or all weapons).</p>\n\n<p><strong>-- ENEMIES --</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are\u00a0<strong>two</strong> enemies in this game. The enemies with guns will <strong>shoot large pink bullets</strong> at you that deal 10 damage when they hit you. The enemies without a gun and a glowing effect will <strong>shoot red time bombs at you.\u00a0</strong>If you get caught in an explosion of the time bomb\u00a0<strong>you will be frozen for 2 seconds</strong>.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T02:50:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b82f7f257a09ee3247d2d8e874d046.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S-Cov"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
