{"id": 756608, "slug": "skeleton-scramble-deluxe", "name": "Skeleton Scramble Deluxe", "name_original": "Skeleton Scramble Deluxe", "description": "Skeleton Scramble Deluxe is a fast-paced, head-to-head real-time strategy game, with a focus on local multiplayer.<br/><br/>You will take on the role of a necromancer, gathering resources to summon an army of skeletons and frantically building a gauntlet of defenses to fend off your opponent, (or a computer-controlled bot.) An innovative upgrade system lets you build units on top of one another to create new creatures and buildings, adding strategic depth without adding complexity to the controls.<br/><br/>Controls are simple and easy to learn, allowing new players to jump right into the action! Play one-handed using only the mouse, connect multiple controllers, or play head-to-head with a friend using a shared keyboard! Your army will move and attack autonomously, allowing you to focus on what to build, and when/where to build it. Most games last under 5 minutes, allowing you to experiment with bold new strategies, or rotate between players in group settings. Maps can be generated randomly, allowing for a more chaotic experience.<br/><br/>Planned Launch Features:<br/><br/><ul><li>2 player local versus with 5 control schemes<br/></li><li>10 CPU-controlled bots with a variety of strategies and difficulties<br/></li><li>Interactive Tutorial<br/></li><li>Score-based Survival Mode<br/></li><li>Rogue-lite Gauntlet Mode with stacking player-selected curses</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T03:51:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b54fb18898f73bf84ddacae13840d5f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris Turd Boomerang Armstrong"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chris Turd Boomerang Armstrong"], "esrb_rating": null}
