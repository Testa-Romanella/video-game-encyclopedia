The gun has a shot count of 100 bullets before it needs a three second reload.</p>\n<p>If you hit a game over, the game will just stop, there is no indication of a game over as yet, but we will revisit this project after the jam is over!</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the game in it's current state, if you have any feedback for us, please let us know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c75/c75c65fab3eaf406fa378d6b70a4fced.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrTTheUSB"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
