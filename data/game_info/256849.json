Noone in the\u00a0team, including myself, really\u00a0knew anything that could make a game about making games. Then it hit me; \"What if the game was already\u00a0created, but it was in alpha?\" As most games start off by sending an alpha version to selected few playtesters\u00a0to check on the\u00a0problems that may exists. We thought it would be\u00a0fun to give you the option to fix them. We had a great idea, and everything was going rather smoothly. However, due to the time limitations and everything else that was going on forcued us to avoid spending too much time on the game, and lot of things had to be cut. In any case, the whole team is more than happy to have finished this entry, and we hope you will enjoy the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c87/c876578874ba88e81eef1e57806f6b2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Origami Interactive"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
