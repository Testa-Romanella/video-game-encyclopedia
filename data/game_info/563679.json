{"id": 563679, "slug": "bard-simulator-2k21", "name": "Bard Simulator 2K21", "name_original": "Bard Simulator 2K21", "description": "<p>A game about being a bard in a medieval fantasy world. Write your own poems from scratch to wow peasants and nobles alike! Share your creations with your friends and express your creativity! Try to avoid getting into trouble with the aristocracy!</p><p>This is a short, largely linear proof of concept and prototype. If people like it, I may spin it out into a more substantial game (hopefully with a less meme-y title, too). Right now gold does nothing and there are no real fail states, though the story is a complete little arc and I hope you play it through to the end!</p><p><strong>Content Warning</strong><strong>:</strong> This game contains strong language and graphic depictions of violence. </p>\n<p>Made for the Valentwines Day Poetry Jam 2021. See the about page for complete credits. It's recommended you leave the sound on, I think it adds a lot to the experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T05:36:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/125/125a0d1f2350d384da6b2154edf0bb67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Chapel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
