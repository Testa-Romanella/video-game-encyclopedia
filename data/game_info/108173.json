It's the first in a (currently untitled) series of games inspired by wildlife photographs.</p><p>Guide the Golden Jackal across Lake Maccat, running day and night through flocks of Lesser Flamingos. Jump over rocky outcrops as the sun sets, and catch fireflies to make the day come again.</p><p><strong>Maccat</strong> is a super-simple game that's really about pretty sounds and colours more than high scores. I hope you enjoy it!</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Press 'up' to jump. The longer you press it, the higher you'll jump. </p><p><em><strong>Maccat is Free!</strong></em></p><p>Maccat is totally free: you can download the game right now, for Windows, Mac and Linux. </p><p>If you'd like to give me a donation, I'd be delighted! In return, I'll add you to a supporter's list and you'll get a personal email at some point during the development of my next game. I'll let you know something secret about what I'm up to, send you a screenshot or a sprite sheet, or let you know if I used your money to buy something for the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b91d8c8b7ce0815440ddc1fd0c2a2a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cut Garnet Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
