You have red tape! In this epic conflict between fantasy and bureaucracy, will you save your city, or sell your soul?<br/><br/>Social Services of the Doomed is a 400,000-word interactive urban fantasy novel by Fade Manley. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. <br/><br/>As an employee of the Department of Supernatural Social Services, it\u2019s your job to mediate when a dispute breaks out between vampires and werewolves. Which is pretty often, these days. Tensions are rising in your city: not all supernatural citizens think that they have to abide by the law. Flocks of harpies are crowing prophecies of doom; wizards are slinging fireballs; trolls aren\u2019t just having peaceful chats about tunneling technology anymore; there are demons in the werewolf dive bar; and something is up with the ley lines. Sometimes it feels like you\u2019re the only one standing between the supernatural factions and a city in flames.<br/><br/>On the other hand, some factions are willing to cut a deal on the side, so if you really want the city to be in flames - and if you feel like that civil-servant paycheck isn\u2019t stretching as far as you\u2019d like - you could make that happen. Every faction knows that you could be useful to them.<br/><br/>How will you handle it? Will you sneak, fight, negotiate, confuse, or just whip out some obscure county regulations? There\u2019s always more paperwork to be done, and if you fall too far behind, your boss might call you in for a chat about your monthly metrics. (Also, your boss might be a constellation.
