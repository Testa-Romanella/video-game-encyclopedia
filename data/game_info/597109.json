The angels will petrify (freeze in place) if obeserved by the player. The flashlight helps to see in dark places but beware, if an angels is observed, it will drain the batteries!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - move<br/>Mouse - look around<br/>Right Click - activate Flash Light<br/>Space - swap Batteries<br/></p>\n<p>This is getting really interesting for a few reasons:<br/>- Its the first custom navigation I made from scrach.<br/>- And most importantly, the navigation is based on weights which are calculated on where the player can actually see. That means it takes into account if the spot the player is observing has enough light to see the angel.<br/>- As a bonus, environmental lights dont illuminate the players \"dead spots\", as he wont be able to see behind an object, even if its illuminated. Its not as straight forward to implements as it sounds.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T21:10:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80b/80b11dcc9aa20b2df8bd0a6404b897df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PseudotsugaMensk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
