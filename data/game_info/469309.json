It's an interactive fiction story. If you like it a lot, please consider buying a t-shirt off of our merch line when it goes live.</p>\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n<p>Here at the <strong>Zhang Space Freight Corporation</strong> (<em>the developer of this interactive science fiction experience</em>), we are avid pupils of an old Chinese adage:\u00a0If you are our fan, we are your fan. Also, do please check out our podcast on\u00a0Anchor.fm! Thank you!</p>\r\nAdditional\u00a0Notes\r\n<p>Video is the same as for our board game offering. As usual, it's not a game trailer, but it is fun to watch\u00a0(<em>we guarantee it!</em>). Also, if you are the original artist of the cover image, let us know and we'll link to your current online portfolio at the bottom of this text!</p>\n<p>Trigger Warning - this gamebook features quite a bit of profanity.</p>\r\nCaveat Emptor\r\n<p>Your mobile browser needs to be able to support local storage.
