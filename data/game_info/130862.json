As you are well aware, TIME MACHINES run on RAINBOWS. And, as everyone knows, rainbows are made from VEGETABLES. With an extinction event on the horizon, your mission is to plant and pick as many vegetables as you can to fuel your escape before the meteor hits.</p>\n<p>Full game lasts around 15 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Cultivate The Rainbow </strong>has been developed for Rainbow Jam 2017. It is at an early stage of development. The game has music, but is currently without sound effects. This is something we\u2019re working on. If we actually had a time machine, it\u2019d have the sound effects by now! </p>\n<p>We are developing a prehistoric farming game with a similar premise. We created \u2018Cultivate The Rainbow\u2019 with the aim of testing some of the mechanics. </p>\n<p>We\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019d like from a prehistoric farming game. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9d/e9d5fc32b9f5ab7c4ab5ff440465dc4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jenny & Gwen @LivingEmber"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
