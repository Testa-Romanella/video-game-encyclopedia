You have your choice of four weapons: The tried and true pistol, the pray and spray machine gun, the apocalypses favorite shotgun, and of course a laser cannon. Pick up health and ammo along the way to avoid having to resort to your melee knife attack. The longer you survive the more of the horde will start coming in each wave so suit up, grab an ammo pack, your favorite weapon, and make your final stand against the Prismatic Horde.</p>\n<p>When your inevitable death comes kick back and enjoy an excessive amount of stats about how badly you lost, and what rotten luck you had! The horde was probably laughing at you, or they would be if they had mouths. How far will you go?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e15ef2a87f8ed7b86f7ff07bd33a3ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sparkade Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
