It also had this slow motion matrix bullet time effect every time your ragdoll threw a punch or kick. Talking about the matrix, doesnt it kinda feel like were living in it lately, all the\u00a0s@!#\u00a0happening in the world.\r\n</p>\n<p>That is definitely where i am getting my inspiration for the theme of my game from, i envisage my game being like a stress ball. Taking out all your stresses of the world and its current state on beating up puppets(in a comedic way that is).\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is in early development and allot of the prototyping and core game mechanics are in place. There is still allot to get done and i would like to share ideas with a community to gain there insight and ideas as i go along on this journey.\r\n</p>\n<p>Current Game State\r\n</p>\n<p>After building a prototype, I decided to work on the puppets(ragdolls) mainly the bosses, i have a few in place\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Brandon (you know, \"let's go Brandon\")\r\n</li><li>Bojo (pretty obvious too)\r\n</li><li>Zoom zoom (not obvious in northern hemisphere but def in the southern hemisphere)\r\n</li><li>Body guards (they can protect the bosses but can also be fought against separately)\r\n</li><li>Bong Slugger (my mate really wanted his own character)\r\n</li><li>Woo han (pretty much what we have been dealing with for the past 2 years...i dont want to get cancelled by mentioning it)\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>Single player is what my main focus is on currently, i want to be simplistic but with lots of content and humuor along the way.\r\n</p>\n<p>Another goal is to make it multiplayer(already working on it) and to add a ranking type system to level up your puppet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0A demo is available to download for PC!<br/></p>\n<p>If you like what you see please feel free to leave a reply so i can answer your questions or take on your great ideas.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T04:30:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56a/56a436284a33f287c3aa31c4622e6cb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BitTwisted"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
