Yes, really.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is my final project as part of the online class CS50's Introduction to Computer Science. It started off as a one-off level, but I ended up getting carried away and turned it into a whole thing, albeit a pretty short one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have been working in the video game industry for a few years already, but hadn't really dabbled into making my own games until the Covid-19 pandemic. Being in lockdown since early March\u00a0gave me an opportunity to pick up coding and this is the result. Considering I had very little programming experience at the start of the year, I'm pretty happy with how far I've come.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some credits:<br/></p>\n<p>:: CS50's Introduction to Computer Science ::</p>\n<p>https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/\u00a0</p>\n<p>:: Text editor used to program Outerspace ::</p>\n<p>https://code.visualstudio.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>:: Engine running Outerspace ::</p>\n<p>https://love2d.org/</p>\n<p>:: Game assets all made by Kenney ::</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/platformer-pack-redux</p>\n<p>:: \"Free Pen\" font by Suzuran San\u00a0::</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/free-pen.font<br/></p>\n<p>:: \"Hand Drawn Shapes\"\u00a0font by JLH Fonts\u00a0::\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/hand-drawn-shapes.font</p>\n<p>:: \"Dogica\"\u00a0font by Roberto Mocci (only used during development) ::</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/dogica.font<br/></p>\n<p>:: Memories Soundtrack by Benjamin Tissot ::</p>\n<p>https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/memories<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:59:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d0645f4f9fc7d22f2e046d6d59c58cac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WinkingFirefly"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
