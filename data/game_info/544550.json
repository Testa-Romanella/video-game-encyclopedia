Is there still time?</p>\n<p>Part first-person exploration, part text adventure, Ephemeris features a\u00a0distinctive idiosyncratic art style and a lo-fi ambient-synth soundtrack, which combine with the ultra-minimal gameplay mechanic to conjure a dream-like atmosphere and a sense of slowly unfolding mystery.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T04:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a64/a64e2878cb9b2c9fc0010aae613d2b91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reluctant Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
