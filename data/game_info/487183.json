Defend yourself from thousands of enemy ninja as they swarm you from all angles! Be warned, the enemy's will shall not falter, they will fight without mercy, lose focus and they will overwhelm you in moments.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>The average number of enemies spawned will increase exponentially with each difficulty level increase. Good luck getting past difficulty level 4 ;)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This is only the second game jam I have entered and finished, and the first jam where I made every asset by myself, which I\u00a0am very happy with\u00a0:D. I'm no sound engineer, but the sounds I\u00a0was able to compose worked for the game so I\u00a0am satisfied with how everything came out :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T04:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/529/529d90deb3eeb614827760baf53242eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mike-Evans"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
