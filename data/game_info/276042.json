This was my first time coding a game and we had ten weeks to complete it. Usually I make the assets, but the assets were all done by the fabulous - Bella Weikman!\u00a0<br/><br/>A little more about Re-Lucid:<br/></p>\n<p>The player will start by exploring the game, figuring out how to open the first door. After going through the door, the player will experience booby traps, darkness draining your sanity meter, puzzles and mazes. The goal of the game is to make it to the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" before your timer reaches 0 and your sanity is fully depleted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking for critiques and advice while moving forward in the gaming world. Thanks so much everyone! I hope you can find the light at the end of the tunnel!</p>\n\n\n<p>Designer: Bella Weikman</p>\n<p>Programmer: Amanda Coler</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aa366870682cf4fa6fbfa659f8e9db6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ColerGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
