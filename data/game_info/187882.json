This is a very early prototype, shared among a few friends to mess around with Unity. Essentially the framework simulation is working and interactive at this stage, with much to add and a whole lot of work to make the sim interesting. I'm aiming to update progress monthly.<br/></p>\n<p>Click on the quest boards to create quests.</p>\n<p>Placeholder graphics from:</p>\n<p>Open Game Art: Kenney, Nemisys, Redshrike, Sharm</p>\n<p>DeviantArt: Ayene-chan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7b/b7bb340f7a71a55e5dc9a0220a71e733.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Renahzor"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
