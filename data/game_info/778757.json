However, it has also cultivated a culture that is now\u00a0surrounded with controversy - cancel culture.</p>\n<p>Through this decision-making game, the user gets to learn how and why cancelling someone\u00a0happens. At times, the reasons could seem ridiculous - especially without context.</p>\n<p>The twist to this game is we will reveal your true identity once you have been cancelled, as these are all based on true events and people. This game has 11 different identities and the branching answers / desicisions made by the users would determine which identity has been selected, which will be revealed when they are cancelled and/or at the end of the game.</p><p>Game is made on Unity, with Fungus.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T08:37:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a11b2f2ca0e0b99ce40d093a168b1193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["nadinegan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
