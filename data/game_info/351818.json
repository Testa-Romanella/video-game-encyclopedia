{"id": 351818, "slug": "alien-kingdom", "name": "Alien Kingdom", "name_original": "Alien Kingdom", "description": "Alien Kingdom is a first person kingdom building and management game with RPG and strategy aspects. You will expand your kingdom by finding stray villagers you'll escort home, and constructing utility buildings like farms &amp; houses, defensive structures such as gates, towers and walls, as well as unit buildings that recruit offensive units for your army.  To combat enemies you have natural abilities such as slowing time and shielding yourself, as well as a variety of weapon types, and influence over the weather.  Your task will be to eliminate one or several enemy bases that will periodically deploy invaders to attack your kingdom. Accomplishing this will unlock new worlds to travel between and colonize, further expanding your empire.  You may also adjust game difficulty at any time, scaling up enemy damage, health and exp, or increase the intensity of enemy invasions. Alien kingdom is also focused on unrestricted leveling and base expansion, confining the strength of your empire only by your imagination.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/7685fbe87c0d735810189489e2bd5ada.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sole Proprietor"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Sole Proprietor"], "esrb_rating": null}
