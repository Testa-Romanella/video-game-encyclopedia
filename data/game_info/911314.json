The city are considering upgrading the fleet, which would mean you losing your job, so now is the time to show them that they don't need to upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - control the ship.</p>\n<p>Space Bar - this will point the ship upwards. There is no other way to right the ship atm.</p>\n<p>H - toggle help on/off</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>I joined this LD as an opportunity to test a physics engine I programmed over the Christmas holidays. The physics are just collision detection and resolution, and was missing a few 'core' methods which I added over the weekend (things like applying forces on the bodies), and I'm happy to say that for a basic game is seems to be okay.</p>\n<p>It would be great if you could let me know if you have any problems running the game. You should be able to just run the executable and it should start.</p>\n<p>I've already heard from friends that the movement is lagging, so hearing from you all would be awesome!</p>\n<p><strong>Post Jam Version</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As I didn't have enough time to finish all the things I wanted to include in the game during the 72 hours, I have started working on a post-jam version of the game. The features and gameplay will largely be the same, but the graphics will be improved as I finish drawing the city and add animations to the background.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T17:07:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/267/267c534037d532584a1fd9b209a72907.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LintfordPickleLD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
