I plan to modify this game in the following ways:</p>\n<p>1. Redesign the game world into a fantasy alien planet for the player's astronaut to explore, including with a longer path to travel instead of just one small room.</p>\n<p>2. Create a storyline of the player character interacting with this planet's inhabitants (played by the existing enemy sprites).</p>\n<p>3. Add a puzzle level with a focus on gravity; if time constraints allow, this may include inverted gravity, but the main focus is the creation of a puzzle level.</p>\n<p>Created by Catherine Anger</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T10:30:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/386/38634ba0c7e7f19870598b2ecd1f07b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["catsilverbird"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
