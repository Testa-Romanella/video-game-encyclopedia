I have big ideas, but they're quite complicated, and I'm very new with pico-8. I only started learning it days before the gam jam because it looked somewhat easy to use, and having a very light background in python was a massive help!\u00a0Either way, big ideas and new tools don't join together that well...heh.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I've almost got all of the bare bones with this game, so enjoy! Though it's only mild platforming, and takes only a couple minutes to beat, it's still something!!</p>\n<p>This game is a platformer where the whole original idea was that you'd control two separate characters, and these characters could morph to form one, with entirely new powers. The big thing to keep in mind, though, is that each character, both combined and not, is useful in some way. Sadly, due to the time constraints and personal delays, I couldn't do it in time for the game jam, but I still showed off the characters' different characteristics and ability to become joined together...as one, even though they were separate at the start.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:41:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/92430f9a4f8b7547016ac3d40897c4ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Voodoo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
