{"id": 767250, "slug": "color-entropy", "name": "Color Entropy", "name_original": "Color Entropy", "description": "<p>Simple arcade about surrendering to entropy. Select any two tiles to mix them. Each pixel will give you a point when crossing to the other side (and will remove it if it ever crosses back!). Timer can be refilled by winning points - how long will you survive?<br/></p><p>Made with the theme \"Delay the inevitable\". I felt that arcade games in general don't actually fit the theme: the fact that losing is inevitable in tetris (for example)\u00a0feels arbitrary and more our fault as players than something intrinsic to the game. I wanted to make a game about something truly inevitable, which got me thinking about entropy. The core idea was to start in an ordered world and slowly \"use up\" the entropy just to keep afloat: Originally, this was going to be a survival crafting game\u00a0where ordered regions could be used as a fuel source to move other regions (to try and order them) - this proved way too ambitious for the jam, so I ended up with this simple game, which imo lacks a hook and gets boring after the second playthrough. But at least, it's finished! yay for jams.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T22:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fb/6fb5e125b8a88b4fbe740a7714ceb8fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["knexator"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
