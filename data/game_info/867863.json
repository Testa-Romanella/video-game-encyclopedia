After years of research into the portal the Facility expanded into what you see now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We found a way to open the portal and activate it on command using these\u00a0creatures we found and collected.\u00a0We managed to collect 2 of the \"Reds\" and they help us connect and control the Link, this allows us to be able to travel in and out. One day we could be able to control the Reds and send them in and not people like you.</p>\n<p>Your job\u00a0as a\u00a0scientist at the facility\u00a0is to enter the portal now named The Link, and collect Links, Each time you enter The Link will be different we have no control of where you end.</p>\n<p>Inside there is always one way out, we call these blue domes\u00a0\"Links\".</p>\n<p>Within the Link is a dark void like other world, you will have a scanner to help you see and work your way round to locate the link to get back out.</p>\n<p>We have found that within some Links are what we call The Reds which reset the Link and send you back out of the portal on touch. Beware as not friendly.</p>\n<p>Reports of the scientists\u00a0children missing at the facility have started to come in and we need to see if the Link is the cause. Also some errors inside the Links.\u00a0Something is happening and we need to understand what we have done....</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T17:37:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/949/949b922a5b7837af535e9e867ab38fcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MoonShineGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
