Could it get any worse?</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Defend yourself against endless hoards of increasingly dangerous zombies as the light fades away. Collect new weapons to keep 'em away as long as you can! How many can you blast?</p>\n<p>This is my first game and a work in progress. A 2-player mode, bosses and more weapons are in the pipeline. If you have any comments, bug reports or suggestions for where I should take this - let me know below!</p>\n<p>The Windows and Linux versions are currently untested. The online version is a work in progress, but seems to play best in Firefox. Please let me know if you have any problems running the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4ae5ac59df1a864a54eb500dbd77c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["camarones"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
