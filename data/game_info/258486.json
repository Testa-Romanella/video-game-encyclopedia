Based on the hit comic series by Luke Pearson, and now a Netflix Original Series, this is the start of your own adventure alongside our blue-haired heroine. Place items and wait to see who shows up: will it be a tiny Elf, a fluffy Woff or maybe an enormous Troll?! Watch the creatures play with the items, chat and picnic with them, then capture the moment with your camera! Meet them all, collect memories and new friends, and fill up your Friendship Book.<br/><br/>Choose where you want to explore<br/>Just like Hilda, you can wander the Wilderness or take to the bustling city of Trolberg. Each is home to many interesting spots such as a waterfall or quaint town square.
