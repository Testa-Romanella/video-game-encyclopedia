Nothing more.<br/><br/>In the game you find yourself in situations where you need stuff but the only way to get it is borrowing it unnoticed. People around you are very tolerant, but their tolerance runs out quickly if you are caught borrowing their stuff!<h3>Gameplay mechanics:</h3>Pick up required objects and take them home without being noticed. If you are noticed you will lose trust and the owner will take back his stuff. Once you run out of trust points, you have failed the level. When you bring objects home, you can complete given objectives, for example collecting 3 chairs or building a house out of 4 walls.<h3>Features:</h3><strong>Picking up objects</strong><br/>You can pick items like, a chair, lamp, wall, etc.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Building houses</strong><br/>Assemble your dream house with the walls you borrowed<br/><br/><br/><strong>People protect their stuff</strong><br/>They don't really want you borrowing their property<br/><br/><br/><strong>Blocking people with objects</strong><br/>When they get annoying<br/><br/><br/><strong>More stuff to do</strong><br/><ul><li>Hiding from people with objects that you took<br/></li><li>Collecting items in the goal area<br/></li><li>Local multiplayer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T03:52:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca3/ca39ee99d66c42c057919131fe1b871a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Potato Panda"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Potato Panda"], "esrb_rating": null}
