There is a twist. To fit the jam theme that was \"rewind\", we made it so<em> the amount that the toy has been wound up is equal to the room's speed.</em> For example, if you are fully unwound, time will be at a standstill. Time your jumps correctly! Since you dropped in a well, you must escape the water that will always be hot on your tail. (Do wind up toys have tails?) Anyway. Good luck, and don't drown! heh</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Space/W/Up to jump</p>\n<p>Hold E to rewind</p>\n<p>ESC to pause</p>\n<p>F4 to go fullscreen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:25:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f00/f0053c8ff9a77831d4fe735304ee12ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThatAsianGameDev", "deadlyfishes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
