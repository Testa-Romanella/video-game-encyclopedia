However your cannonballs have been tampered with, and are now super bouncy! Be wary and avoid them as you collect your gold. Don't get too greedy thoughh, as they may be your downfall.<br/></p>\n<p>This was intended as a 'one week' project where I aimed to complete a simple arcade game. Ultimately, because of life commitments it ended up taking me three weeks. As it was a project meant to refine my skills, I'm putting it out for free for others to play and enjoy.<br/></p>\n<p>This was created entirely using Unity 5.6.2xf1 Linux, Gimp and Blender. However most of what you see is from free or cheap assets from the Unity store.</p>\n<p>Slack:<br/>There's is optional Slack support for posting highscore results. You will find a slack.txt file in the download now with further instructions. You will need the Slackbot extension already installed for your Slack team for this to work.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Ship: Watercraft by Kenney Vleugels (Kenney.nl)<br/>Font: Bubble Font by Jazz Create Games<br/>Chest: Treasure set by Fairy shop<br/>Sounds: Freesound.org and 512 Sound Effects (8-bit) by SubspaceAudio<br/>Gems: Gem Shader by Unity Technologies<br/>Water: Low Poly Water by Jolix<br/>Easing: C.J.
