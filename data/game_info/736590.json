Particularly important are flight and gimbal controls, as well  as  navigation and coordination of drones. Another distinctive feature  of  the simulator is a lifelike representation of distance and angle of   view between the pilot and the aircraft. In addition to training, the   simulator is also intended to arouse interest in the exciting subject   area surrounding the drone. It is neither cheap to purchase a UAS, nor   is it easy to meet the necessary conditions to put it into operation.   The drone simulator is intended to provide a virtual reality for anyone   who has the necessary hardware, in which they can enjoy flying a drone   without worry and in a relaxed manner. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>- Physics-based drone behavior <br/>- Virtual drone camera with virtual downlink <br/>- Fully functional gimbal system<br/>- Controller tracking <br/>- Virtual drone app with real-time minimap and telemetry<br/>- 3D environment to explore<br/>- Interactive sound design<br/><br/><strong>Requirements</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Oculus Quest 1 | 2 <br/>Optional: <br/>- Bluetooth gamepad<br/>- Surround audio headset<br/></p>\n<p> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T05:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64c678f378b97e90e721f9672429f3aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["0_Space"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
