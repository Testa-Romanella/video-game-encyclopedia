All you have to do is go into town and get eggs. It's really simple. Game is unfinished and abruptly ends but maybe I'll finish it later on when I'm not lazy lmao</p>\n<p>I made most of the soundtrack to this game. Shout out to my friends that got me through high school. We all may be getting older and growing apart but I'll always have the memories.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T05:27:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65d06c5be4444b9c7df30dfb95123a70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thebiggingey"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
