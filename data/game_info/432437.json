In France, Lenormand is considered the greatest cartomancer of all time, highly influential on the wave of French cartomancy that began in the late 18th century.<br/><br/>After Lenormand's death her name was used on several cartomancy decks including a deck of 36 illustrated cards known as the Petit Lenormand or simply Lenormand cards still used extensively today.The 36 card Lenormand deck is modelled on a deck of cards published ca.1799 as part of Das Spiel der Hoffnung (The Game of Hope), a game of chance designed by Johann Kaspar Hechtel of Nuremberg.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T13:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/6605253c4fbf3b7ce243d25c578d9585.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marilyn Roxie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
