It is a 2D game in their moderately successful Army Men franchise. Much like Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, the story has General Plastro and his army of tan figurines have decided to take over the world and it is up to Sarge and reporter Vikki G. to thwart the conquest. Throughout the game, the player is required to rescue team members, infiltrate tan bases, escape from a jail, investigate an extra terrestrial presence, and retrieve communications equipment. The player can choose to play as either Sarge or Vikki, but the quests for each are identical and once a character has been chosen it is impossible to switch to the other unless the player wants to start again from the first mission.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-06T18:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab54e1502ff57b790d0b3617ac0019bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 21, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["DC Studios", "DC Comics"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["The 3DO Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
