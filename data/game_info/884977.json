Obviously, we needed to incorporate DECOY into this somehow. If you\u2019ve heard of There is no Game, we attempted to recreate the credit scene game. It begins with the organisation, leading to the credit scene and, because we love our organisation, we end the actual game with the organisation as well. Essentially, the organisation game and the credit scene game act as decoys to each other.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T06:20:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/997/997042e2b093c7f0af03024de1da4037.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cheyenne_Peter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
