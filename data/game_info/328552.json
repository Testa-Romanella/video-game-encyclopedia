A Classic.\r\nWhat could be done to make this fantastic game even better?\r\nHow about...adding 2 Player?\r\n<p>This version of snake will have you either playing by yourself to beat your high score OR find yourself a friend or just anyone willing to play, and sit down and enjoy 2 player snake!</p>\n\n<p>You may be wondering how does that even work? Well think of it as cat and mouse. One of you is the Cat (Snake) and one of you is the Mouse (Food). The Food has 60 seconds to survive from the snake.</p>\r\nHow to Play?\r\n<p><strong>Single-Player:</strong></p>\n<p>-Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>-P to Pause and Un-Pause</p>\n<p>-R to Reset high score</p>\n<p><strong>Co-op:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Arrow Keys to move snake</p>\n<p>-WASD Keys to move food</p>\n<p>-P to Pause and Un-Pause</p>\n\n<p>Really hope you enjoy, I made this during my A-Levels...probably not the best time to make a game but oh well!
