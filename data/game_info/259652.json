A Windows build is available for regular 3d game play without a vive. Linux, Mac, and android builds are not currently available.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The current build is an Alpha build, and not all items have full functionality yet. The game is still being updated, and future builds will add more functionality to the game. <strong> It is recommended that you have at least a minimum level VR capable PC even if you do not have a VR headset to run the desktop version. </strong></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Join the Dr. Kady Psyche as a new intern at the Ivory Peaks Corporation in her experimental hypnolab!
