The NO3- gauge sparkles when the sell modifiers are active.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>No Thyme to Waste</strong> is a Solarpunk-inspired game for <strong>Godot Wild Jam 38</strong>. There is no goal, there is no end game. There is only fish, basil, and of course, Thyme.<br/></p>\n<p>We chose to look into <strong>Aquaponics</strong>, a method for generating both edible fish and edible plants in a sustainable, high-throughput way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In our game you can buy fish and plants, and sell them after they've grown. There's also a mild management system for Nitrogen in the water, which modifies sell prices.<br/></p>\n<p>Programming: Daverinoe</p>\n<p>Artwork: Liioni</p>\n<p>Music used under CC BY 3.0 license, composed by Antti Luode</p><p>Water and insect sound effects used under CC BY 3.0 license. <br/></p>\n<p>If you promise not to judge my code too much, you can find the source here<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/909/9099bd0135ed7be1b4009aafa4cf8be7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Liioni", "Daverinoe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
