My approach was that the game starts as an exploration game with decisions and end up as a survival horror game, and reminding us that\u00a0<strong><em>sometimes remembering isn't that good.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Note: the demo is\u00a0incomplete, mostly laking gameplay and all the audio. Will update it as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Made by: Diogo Ferreira</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T08:07:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0e/d0e46e6d895e313a3152c977c3923e54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diogo Ferreira"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
