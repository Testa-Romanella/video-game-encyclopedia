In particular those we hold dear but also people around us. The player progresses through the story in a similar way that the main character does. The subjects can be confusing or uncomfortable, but the act of continuing deeper into the history can reveal the truth of the feelings involved.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce6d5805dff0adb6ab9a719803dae76f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IzzyViz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
