What's shown is unlikely to represent the final product.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Nonograms are logic puzzles that when finished depict an image.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By process of elimination, you use the numbers provided to cross out the tiles that do not belong to the final image.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>In this game you'll be chipping away at a giant cube instead, until you leave behind a voxel model, like if you where carving a sculpture.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Blocks have numbers depicting how many blocks are behind them. Each number also may have blue dots depicting in how many clumps those blocks are spread into.</p>\n<p>If there's an uninterrupted row of blocks, there will only be 1 dot. If they are split into 2 rows, there'll be 2, etc. \u00a0</p>\r\nSome examples: \u00a0\r\n<ul><li>If a row has a 0, all of the blocks in that row should be destroyed since none belong to the final model.(0\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1)</li><li>If a row has 3 blocks and it has a number 2. You can be sure that the block in the middle of the row will belong to the final model. Since no matter how you try to picture the clump, the middle one will always end up belonging. (2\u25a1\u25a0\u25a0 or 2\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1)</li><li>If a row has 4 blocks and a number 4. All of the blocks belong.(4\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0)</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD rotates the puzzle.<br/></p>\n<p>Q and E zooms in and out.<br/></p>\n<p>Left click destroys blocks.</p>\n<p>Right click marks blocks, preventing you from destroying them. Use this to secure blocks that belong to the final model.<br/></p>\n<p>Press ESC to open the pause menu.</p>\n\r\nNotes and known issues(to be fixed):\r\n<ul><li>The puzzles are currently too easy since every block has a number. Making solving them trivial.\u00a0 </li><li>Cannot currently view player stats. They should still be saved for when this is fixed.</li><li>The Linux build has NOT been tested.</li><li>Godot's PCK could not be saved separately due to engine bugs. This does not affect the game itself but it makes the game harder to mod unlike other Godot games. This should be fixed in the future.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T13:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d1/6d1093d51a335a95452bd9e8205f691b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Nancok"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
