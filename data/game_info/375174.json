It's where British Captain Cook murdered a Maori Leader called Te Maro, amongst others. Later backstabbing British colonials and their collaborators attacked and murdered many of local tribes, stealing land and enforcing colonialism. These things happened all around Aotearoa and have never been accounted for. Instead the British and NZ Colonials want to come and celebrate Cook. No one would be content with this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T06:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc74eff0f9ea4d4a821a152b4ed14740.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ake3"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
