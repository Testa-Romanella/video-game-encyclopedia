If the root of your ship gets destroyed, everything attached to it is destroyed, forcing the player to consider how they build.</p>\n<p>There are 4 parts you can build with:</p>\n<ul><li>Structural Peice: A vertical stuctural component</li><li>Structural Junction: A Y junction that creates more branches for your ship</li><li>Turret: Shoots towards the cursor. Recharges ammo when it receives a power core from the ship.</li><li>Thruster: Provides ship thrust.</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<p>The primary objective is to protect the main core of the ship, which produces power cells to power the components of your ship.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>BUILD between each wave, adding new components to your ship.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>FIGHT against waves of enemies, with each wave getting increasingly more difficult.</strong></p>\n<p>This was made as part of Global Game Jam 2023, everything was made within the 48 hour time limit.\u00a0 All code was created within 48 hours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Developer: PowerfulBacon<br/></p>\n\n<p>Celestia by Ghostrifter Official | https://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p>Creative Commons CC BY-SA 3.0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T17:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aee/aee864bee2436b680ba35e24d2826287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PowerfulBacon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
