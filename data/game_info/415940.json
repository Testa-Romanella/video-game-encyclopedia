If you left click while holding right click, you'll slam the wall and delete the last letter you transmitted</p>\n<p>--Aim--<br/>Your goal is to transmit messages in morse code, and translate the messages you receive from the other side.<br/>The translation is much easier if you write down the dots and dashes as you receive them, and do the translation after you have all these confirmed.<br/>You can also slam the wall to force your friend to reset the sending sequence.</p>\n<p>--Tips--<br/>The first \"sos\" message is for calibration, with some fail safe that resets it if you're obviously just spam clicking. That said, it's still possible that you could mess up calibration massively, so if you're having a lot of difficulty and the dot and dash timing seems super weird, try restarting and doing that sequence again.</p>\n<p>Made for Lovejam 2020<br/>Thank you to all the creators at freesound.org, your stuff is amazing.
