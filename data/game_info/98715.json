Give it a spin and see if you learn anything new!</p><p>VERSION NOTE:</p><p>The web version is the most complete, but omits one important fact in the instructions: you fire your secondary weapon with right click.</p><p>The original submission to the 7DRL is still available as a PC download, it has less content and lacks a few minor adjustments to the controls. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa5/fa5beccb9b62193963fbccb7e369a0c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["savagehill"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
