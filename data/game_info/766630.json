It is inevitable it will explode, but you can try to delay the explosion just long enough to minimize damage. This game has four main endings and many more, ran-out-of time endings. This game was made for Ludum Dare 50, Delay the Inevitable. I probably will polish it up after the jam.</p>\n<p>(Note: the score equals the current number of seconds left.
