In 10 weeks. With 100 men. With 3 ships. This is a <strong>LIE</strong>!<br/><br/>Firstly, someone had to defeat kraken and tritons. Someone had to vanquish the Leviathan. Someone had to banish all the ghost ships. The information about these deeds is missing from the archives, and you can\u2019t find it in any great statesmen\u2019s memoir. The knowledge of the \u201cAvant Armada\u201d was completely erased by some bloody officials.<br/><br/>The people who took part in the expeditions were not sane people. Maniacs, psychos and common crackpots were forced by royal orders to eradicate Evil in the uncharted seas. \u201cHere Be Dragons\u201d describes these events.<strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/> <ul><li> Use original Dice Activation System to attack enemies, heal your crew, and upgrade the fleet.<br/></li><li>    Collect and use Command Points to turn the tide of the encounter. <br/></li><li>     Cross the seas with an ancient, living map, full of terrible creatures that want to devour you!<br/></li><li>    Confront the most fierce beasts that ever lived: leviathans and krakens, predatory whales and lustful mermaids. Decimate tritons, awake Dagon, and then erase them from human memory.</li></ul><strong>SATIRE</strong><br/> <ul><li>Meet an extraordinary company of weirdos, madmen and oddballs. Their vices and virtues fuel the journey.<br/></li><li>    Experience clashes with bureaucratic machine. Don\u2019t lose your mind when confronted by absurdities spewed by authorities and royal advisors.<br/></li><li>    Sniff at pirates. Ignore the settlers. You are above them. You are a monster hunter traversing through the aqua incognita. Who cares if you are insane?</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T03:23:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22a/22afdc832133130289030fc131457323.jpg", "website": "http://www.redzerogames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["bartosz.mazur90", "Red Zero Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Red Zero Games", "RED ZERO GAMES S C"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
