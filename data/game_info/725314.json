I observed the constraints \"fixed color palette (use pico8 palette)\" and \"one screen / button / life / room\" (all at one !). I also tried to fit the main theme, since the bird was supposed to be a robot bird and the columns full of ivy.<br/></p>\n<p>So I did this simple Flappy game, with an infinite level. Enjoy the game and try to beat your high score !</p>\n<p><strong>Controls : juste press Space or left click to play</strong><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T10:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf6/cf6d0bdf26b9fe28738f1c23db0a018f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Meta-link"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
