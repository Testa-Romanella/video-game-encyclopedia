It starts with the left uppermost field (1). Click on one of the five color buttons at the bottom of the playing field (2) to select a neighboring color. The color boxes are converted to this color, thus expanding the finished area (3). The process must be repeated until the playing field is changed to the same color. <br/><br/>Each color can be selected up to five times. If the five options are not enough, the game is lost.<br/><br/>The game ends when the playing field has been turned into the same color. <br/><br/>Your game results will be listed in the leaderboard.
