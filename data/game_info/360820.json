{"id": 360820, "slug": "single-digit", "name": "Single Digit", "name_original": "Single Digit", "description": "<p>A little project that I challenged myself to do all alone, for the <strong>GMTK\u00a0 Game Jam 2019</strong>. Amusingly, that one-man-team challenge happened to be quite fitting , the jam's theme being \"Only One\".<br/></p>\n<p>So, what is Single Digit about?\u00a0</p>\n<p>To make it simple, let's say it's your typical turn-by-turn RPG, but with only the fighting part. That means all  you do,  here, is fighting monsters one after another. <br/></p>\n<p>As you probably know, turn-by-turn RPG tend to work wih a bunch of statistics and numbers.\u00a0 Now, imagine <strong>an RPG where all the numbers are formed with only one digit</strong>. Yep. That's my game!<br/></p>\n<p>Of course, since there's this single digit constraint, the rules are far more different than those of your classic RPG. And the game is all about <strong>understanding the rules to win the fights</strong>. So it's <strong>more like a puzzle-game concept</strong>, actually.<br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately,\u00a0there's definitely not enough content, right now. I just didn't have the time to design the battles. I'll probably fix this, though, when the time comes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:41:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c73e7b9885eb98f2325e1be5956fccf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nui"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
