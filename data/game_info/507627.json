Mobs appear in the room you are currently in.\u00a0When you kill them (by shooting fireballs) they drop coins. With this money you can buy power ups (flasks) or unlock new rooms. When you unlock a new room, more mobs will spawn and more flasks will be available. The goal is to protect The Chest, in the middle of the first room. Mobs will try to take it, and the more they are next to it,\u00a0 the more its life goes down. Some mobs will prefer attacking you than The Chest, so you need to\u00a0survive and get as many coins as possible. Have fun x)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e10ff1bab65e5b456e8a6c083f27733d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sperox07"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
