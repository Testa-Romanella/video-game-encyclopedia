Re:Mastered</em> is the remake (or more appropriately, \u201crequel\u201d: remake + sequel) of the Flash visual novel (VN) <em>Dating Sim</em>,  which was created in 2008 as a college final project. Because of  Flash\u2019s end of life on December 31, 2020, I\u2019ve decided to give this VN a  renewal, with an updated engine, graphics, characters, and of course a  slightly new take on it.\r\n</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>After a particularly rough night, the protagonist of <em>Dating Sim</em>  crawls into bed to forget his loneliness as yet another day of him  being single passes by. When he awakens, the protagonist discovers that  it\u2019s actually May 30, 2020, twelve years after his nap!\r\n   </p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, the protagonist finds that he\u2019s <em>still</em> in college and <em>still</em>  hasn\u2019t found a girlfriend. While usually a successful student, the  protagonist is now struggling to maintain his grades and his luck with  the ladies hasn\u2019t improved one bit.\r\n   </p>\n<p>Polishing up his grades may be hard but with your help, finding a  girlfriend may not be! Can the protagonist win over his dream girl with  this new chance he\u2019s been given? <br/></p>\r\nCharacters\r\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can listen to voice samples at the official site!</strong><br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Free!\r\n</li><li>A major improvement over the first \"Dating Sim\" (use a Flash emulator if you want to play the prequel)\r\n</li><li>Three lovely girls, each with their own quirks\r\n</li><li>A short but silly and comedic VN as you \"help\" the protagonist find a girlfriend</li><li>Rating: 17+ for coarse language, crude humor and adult themes mentioned</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li><strong>Concept / Story</strong><ul><li>Ryne D.
