Go through the post-canada strike line to start your day. Each box has a color and needs to be sorted in the proper drop zone. Use the scanner room to reveil the color of the boxes. Each successful drop gives you points, but watch out not to drop a box in the wrong drop zone or you will lose points. You can discard boxes in the garbage zone.\u00a0Enjoy!</p><p>HTML version of the game :\u00a0https://frankgalax.itch.io/roboboxhtml</p>\n<p>Controls : Left stick or WASD or Arrows</p>\n<p>Janick Fortin -\u00a0Programming</p>\n<p>Francis Richard-Emond - Programming</p>\n<p>Nicolas Gauthier-R\u00e9gis - Art</p>\n<p>Carl Perreault - Art</p>\n<p>Sp\u00e9cial Thanks to Jessyca Lemire-Bertrand and Thomas Tu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/599/5991d00b5f0fc55dcb96c7460ba137af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FrankGalax"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
