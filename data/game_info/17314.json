Maybe you like tower defense games but find them a bit boring? Heldric is a unique mix of the same old styles of game with a few new twists. A hack-n-slash without endless level grinding.  A tower defense game with more action. A game where you don't play as an epic hero, but as a humble shoemaker who must work together with his fellow villagers to defend their home. <br/><br/>Build and upgrade the village quickly before the attack waves start. Each building you place adds unique abilities to not only the player's character, but your fellow villagers as well.  You must choose your structures wisely, as there are only a limited amount of plots available on each map.
