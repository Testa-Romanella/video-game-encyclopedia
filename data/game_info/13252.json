{"id": 13252, "slug": "la-mulana", "name": "La-Mulana", "name_original": "La-Mulana", "description": "<p>In La-Mulana, the player assumes the role of an adventurer archeologist and explores the ruins of a forgotten ancient civilization.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game follows an archeologist named Lemeza Kosugi. He continues the research of the lost city of La-Mulana that was started by his father Shorn. La-Mulana is a magical place that the protagonist believes was the source of all human civilizations. Its architecture consists of a mixture of various ancient cultures, such as Greek, Egyptian or Maya. Lemeza discovers that all human civilizations were created by an alien &quot;Mother&quot; with a goal to help it return to space.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Lemeza in a 2D environment. The main character has to explore the levels that consist of many mazes, platforms, and environmental puzzles. The levels are non-linear, and the player can complete the game in a variety of ways, although there are no alternate endings. Lemeza can use his whip to fight enemies or to break some parts of the environment to clear the way.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game intentionally imitates the retro style of 16-bit console games from the 90s. It uses a limited color palette and pixelated visuals. La-Mulana is also obviously inspired by the Indiana Jones film series. The main character wears a fedora, fights with a whip and is very similar to Indiana. The game is set to the music typically associated with old adventure films.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2012-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-17T22:44:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a1b/a1b4791714063c7c6793a68b3e25827a.jpg", "website": "http://la-mulana.com/", "rating": 3.48, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 70, "owned": 999, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 39, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 107, "ratings_count": 69, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Xbox One", "Wii", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["NIGORO"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["AGM PLAYISM", "NIS America", "Active Gaming Media", "EnjoyUp Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
