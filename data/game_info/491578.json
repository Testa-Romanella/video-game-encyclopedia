The goal of each level is to prevent a machine from breaking down. Each level has a unique circumstance that the machine must be in in order to shut it off successfully. Failing to maintain the machines many systems before it is shut down results in a game over. Are you up to the task?<br/><br/><br/>WARNING: This game is made to be challenging. Some levels are rigorously difficult to complete, but most are beatable. I say \"most\" because I have reserved a section of levels called \"Insane\" levels. Unlike all other level difficulties, these levels will not be tested to see if they are able to be beaten. You have been warned.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, you want a longer description? Fine, here's a list of features:<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> 20+ levels, ranging from Easy to Insane<br/></li><li> A tutorial mode so you stand a chance<br/></li><li> Make one mistake and it's game over<br/></li><li> Every time you lose, you'll be insulted!<br/></li><li> Charming pixel graphics</li></ul><br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? A totally relaxing and not at all rage inducing experience awaits...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T04:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fbadd530169f918bcf86b507d83545be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tommy Galletta"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Tommy Galletta"], "esrb_rating": null}
