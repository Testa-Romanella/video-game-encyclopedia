Prove it.<br/><br/>The sky is blue, the grass is green and Pogocat is prepared for a wholesome day of jumping. Hop, flip, spring, boing, and skip with her as far as possible across the grassy mountain plains.<br/><br/>Pleasant? Perhaps, but probably not. After all, it's a cat on a pogo-stick. There will be falls, and there will be tears. Patience is essential on Pogocat's journey.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- An endless, gruelling journey with you, a pogo stick and a persistent hopping cat.<br/>- High-difficulty, physically-simulated pogo motion-dynamics.<br/>- Feline outfits to make the journey more colourful (yes, Pogocat actually enjoys dress-ups)<br/>- A feline friendship worth working for.<br/><br/>Remember that feeling that you once had where one day you'd come across a cat on a pogo-stick? The day has come, and it's a beautiful one at that.<br/><br/>SUBSCRIPTION INFO:<br/><br/>Subscribe to play the game and many more!<br/>\u2022 The subscription gives you unlimited access to all the games offered in Playond and includes:<br/>\t- A lot of amazing games<br/>\t- Many hours of play time<br/>\t- New games added all the time<br/>\t- No ads or extra payments<br/>\u2022 Subscription length: weekly, monthly<br/>\u2022 Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.<br/>\u2022 You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal from your Account Settings after the purchase.<br/>\u2022 Your subscription will renew automatically, unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.<br/>\u2022 The cost of renewal will be charged to your account in the 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.<br/>\u2022 When canceling a subscription, your subscription will stay active until the end of the period.
