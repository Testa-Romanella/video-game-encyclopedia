I tried for a few hours to fix it to no avail. Sometimes when loading \u00a0a level, you will lose the ability to shoot and only a single \"ranger\" enemy will spawn. To fix this problem, reload the project with the green flag at the top and select \"story mode\". This will put you back at the point you were before with all of your upgrades.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T14:29:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/02107a7969de9c3aecf20ee827422d09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sterling Gamer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
