Your skin sweltering in the parching climate that encased this entire planet. This could be expected. You don\u2019t want to be here and you certainly aren\u2019t here by choice. Aliens from a distant planet invaded your home world, slaughtering all they came across, tearing the ground itself apart for trinkets and minerals, destroying societies and replacing them with machines. Luckily, there were survivors; people rescued by the straggling remains of your world\u2019s military. You jumped from planet to planet, fleeing from the invaders, but it seemed your fate was to be followed, each planet in the system falling one after the other, and more of your people with each one. Now you\u2019re all that there is - the last of your kind - alone on the last unoccupied planet, following orders the last soldier gave before he sent you to survive. <br/></p>\n<p>-Tutorial for the game-<br/></p>\n<p>W/A/S/D to walk.<br/></p>\n<p>SPACE to jump.</p><p>SHIFT to sprint.<br/></p>\n<p>MOUSE to look around.<br/></p>\n<p>MOUSE1 to shoot.</p><p>W/S to Raise/Lower settings.<br/></p>\n<p>To clear the stage you need to survive againts waves of enemies and collect fuel cells to escape from the planet.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T07:19:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd5c9dab959a1a6182a6b648d3c394ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WingMen"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
