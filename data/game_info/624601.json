I used the first scene - where Conway stops at Equus Oils - as a guide for the level and interactions. Something that I love about that scene is that is builds a world around characters and relationships, rather than through exposition. You're thrown into what feels like a rich environment, full of history and mystery. I tried to do the same here.\u00a0<br/><br/>I recently moved to London, and I've been enjoying navigating the underground in all of\u00a0all of its beauty and intrigue and grime.\u00a0 That felt like a good backdrop for a Kentucky Route Zero-like story about delivering a letter.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:41:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/712/7127b2a22ed541cca9edaed528b20931.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adon\u00e9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
