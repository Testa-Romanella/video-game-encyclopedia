By now, it is your civic duty to find your way out and discover the secrets within.</p>\n<p>From the story of Daedalus and Icarus' Labyrinth of Knossos, we bring you a real a-maze-ing RPG puzzle platformer. As the chosen one - <strong>Tanta</strong> - you are to be imprisoned in the cell, and your only goal is to figure which way is out. Jump, push, pull, and throw objects to their right places, and watch out for the flipping platforms! But ask yourself again, is this the way out? What is on the other side? Nobody knows; but now it's your turn to find out, if you can make it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THIS GAME IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT STAGES.\u00a0</strong>The game likely has a lot of bugs, and lacks leveling, as well as - sadly - sound design. We had it on hand but due to school stuff we weren't able to add it by the submission to The Icehouse Game Jam. We still hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>We are very excited to further release the currently developing parts of the game soon and\u00a0 <strong><em>we want you to be part of this by commenting down below on suggestions, feedback, critiques and bugs you might encounter in the game!</em></strong>\u00a0\u00a0Do keep updated as we have some exclusives for game testers so stay tuned!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a73/a73db55a9c90b2f7f6664a7cf68f7f2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BLINDERSTUDIOS"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
