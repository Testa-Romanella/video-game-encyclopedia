It was hilarious, at least I thought it was at the time. There was a scene where the the annoying brother 'Chet' was turned into a turd. So I go to thinking, how could I make a paranormal game that was a tribute to 'Weird Science'? So I can up with 'Plugger the Paranormal Plumber'. If you have a haunted bathroom or there's something strange in your toilet bowl, who ya gonna call? - Plugger of course. I hope you enjoy. I wish I had more time to dedicate to the Jam, I'm back to work soon, it was fun while it lasted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebc670f1afb41dc9551fc946950dc742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aenever"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
