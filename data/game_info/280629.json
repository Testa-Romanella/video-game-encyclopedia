Bring in your friends from among the Zylons (Preying Mantis), Altaren (eagles), Alcorians (ants), Xendoids (Velociraptors), and Slimalacticans (a loose confederation of slimes, amoeboids, worms, funguses, and frungii). What is a frungii you ask? Play and find out.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA full 3D MMORPG is also in the works featuring the same races with new spaceships and land mounts. It will commence with the first full 3D PvP map on the Altaren homeworld and will be done via Amazon's Lumberyard engine.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis version features a collision-free starship system and an infinite universe.  Space is vast!  So collisions between starships would be easy to avoid, even in \"close proximity.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a teeny, tiny introduction to the above concept with more planned later, something to get your feet wet and help fund future releases.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/266/26613085815ef1acdba222ff734ac434.jpg", "website": "http://www.darksunpictures.com/darksunvideogame.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Sun Pictures"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Dark Sun Pictures"], "esrb_rating": null}
