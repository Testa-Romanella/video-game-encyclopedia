This is a project I`ve been working on for the last few weeks using gamemaker. I am really sorry if it isn`t quite a polished game as i`ve just started doing gamemaker and stuff and plus i`m thirteen. I would love some constructive feedback and if people like it enough I will work on improving it! Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>You can stick to walls by pressing the arrow pointing towards the desired wall and to move upwards you press the up arrow. You can also glide!!
