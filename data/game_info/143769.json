What if you could not just play the accords, but the literal meaning of your favorite song? Our prototyped game is about the song \"For the very first time\" by Robbin Beck. The reason we choosed this song was the theme \"For the first time\" of the First Jam promoted by GDDC UofT game development club. <br/><br/>It's just some seconds of the song, but we hope you have fun! :) </p><p>Developers:</p><p>Art - Wellington Bezerra  (https://www.facebook.com/wellington.gomesbezerra)</p><p>Programming - Alan Ricardo (https://www.facebook.com/alan.rgomes)</p><p>Brazil &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["alanrgo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
