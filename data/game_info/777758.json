{"id": 777758, "slug": "life-with-anxiety", "name": "Life With Anxiety", "name_original": "Life With Anxiety", "description": "<p>In this game, you will play through a week of life as a kid with anxiety. You will play through a five-day school week and see what kinds of \u2018normal\u2019 things aren\u2019t so normal for someone with anxiety. This game is loosely based on my experience growing up with generalized anxiety disorder. The reason I say loosely based is because anxiety can look very different for different people, so I wanted to show some things I didn\u2019t struggle with, but many people with anxiety do. Please do not play this game if you think you will be triggered by it. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T16:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b761fd6a1f2ae785b3b00299eec0602f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cdenny"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
