The story follows our hero John, who is a veteran, trying to do amends in his screw up life and he only has his space ship AI, who still cares about him. The story latter unfolds some pretty interesting things about John, his life and his relationship with stuff around him.  <br/>The game itself is based on a dodging/blowing up stuff, but that quickly falls in background picture, since you have to outmaneuver the enemy, who are constantly changing. Your job is to save planets from incoming asteroids, while taking care of your affairs with other bounty hunters.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>unique boss fights with different difficulty levels <br/></li><li>defend the nearby planets from vicious asteroids attacks <br/></li><li>battle other bounty hunters </li></ul><br/><br/><br/>The concept of the game is to farm experience, so you can unlock new upgrades. You can collect mastery points from other bounty hunter ships to unlock new ships. If you find yourself unable to progress the game, you can always come back to earlier levels and farm experience, which you can use to make limitless upgrades for you ship. Each new level brings a quest with an unique one time ship upgrade, so use it wisely. <br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>over 100 different size and texture asteroids, flying towards the planets <br/></li><li>5 different types of bounty hunters, exchanging whole game trying to kill you  <br/></li><li>5 different bosses, each having completely unique mechanic</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Your ship 4 unique abilities <br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Basic attack</strong> - limited to 3 energy particles on screen <br/></li><li><strong>Photon swarm</strong> - more powerful - giant balls of energy spinning and crushing everything ahead, it has 3 charges stored on ship <br/></li><li><strong>Death ray</strong> - laser cutting asteroids like it's a knife going through butter, it has significantly larger cool down, so use it wisely <br/></li><li><strong>Final blast</strong> - ultimate attack - sends a missile with a shape of a phoenix to the center of the screen and blowing everything hostile in 360' area.
