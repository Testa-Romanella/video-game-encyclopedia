Your \"goal\" is to collect mines without being blown up.<br/>Since an active mine (indicated by a red circle) will explode if you step on it, you can place a \"jammer\" that will disable all mines in the chunk it occupies and in all neighboring chunks (these chunks will be temporarily highlighted based on their spatial relationships to one another). Once a mine is disabled (indicated by a green circle), you can walk over it to pick it up.<br/>If you leave the area, mines and jammers will disappear, but when you come back, mines that were previously generated and jammers you have placed will be restored.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:59:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e92/e92cf8bf9d85118c6b27da761c6f6e4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["problemecium"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
