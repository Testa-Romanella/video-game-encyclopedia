When hit by wind the tal will only shrink down to the branch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:29:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78b/78bff4414b328a4aaed2e8225bb4e88d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KasamatsuLila"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
