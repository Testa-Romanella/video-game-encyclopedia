The world is tube and you can run on walls! Its a whacky, wild and tubular adventure!</p>\n\n<p>I started work on TUBER around the middle of 2020 when there wasn't a whole lot going on in the world. Since then, TUBER has been a solo project of mine. Many of the processes and design elements that went into creating TUBER can be found on my portfolio site\u00a0here. Some of the songs featured in TUBER were created by my friend 6illy who's SoundCloud\u00a0 page outlines more of his work. The TUBER demo is free to download and redistribute. Thank you for playing!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T03:35:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87f/87f243c1d7f5b13f3ec36c88292dde34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Gaborit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
