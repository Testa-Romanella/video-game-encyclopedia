The owners have forbidden visitors for many years, and rumors are that the place may well be haunted.</p><p>You learned that a journal was left in there, and a terrible secret was written in its pages. You were tasked with retrieving it, only to find its binding broken, its contents scattered throughout the old manor.</p><p>However, nobody knows what the manor's interior even looks like, let alone the contents of the journal. Will you be able to uncover their secrets?</p><p>~</p><p>Excerpts is an short exploration game made for Procjam 2015 in the span of ~3 days. The levels and 'plot' details are procedurally generated, the former with binary / ternary space partitioning, the latter with a Markov chain.</p><p>This game can possibly mention death and/or abuse, or other strange combinations if you're (un)lucky.</p><p>It is a work in progress, and may forever remain so. But there is a story behind the manor, and it's possible to find it. You may have to search outside of the manor to do so.</p><p>11.25.15: A web version has been added. It requires a modern browser and WebGL to play, and is at an unfortunately large (1024x768) resolution for web. Windows users may want to play the download version instead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/356/3564e8586232b18ea3aa03878fa6aeaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Amorphous"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
