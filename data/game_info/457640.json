The content of each room will be changed every week automatically, meaning you wont have to download a new version every time the paintings change.</p>\n<p>It's a fully fleshed out 3D enviroment with the idea of making the meme viewing experience a bit more entertaining, rather than just looking at still pictures.</p>\n<p>This project is and always will be <strong>free</strong>, donations are still a thing but the price wil not change. You can also send your own memes art/drawings/photos that you want to be displayed. It comes with a way to see the artist contact info and a description if they choose to add one. <br/></p>\n<p>I'm still setting up the ways for people to send me memes, but do not fret, have over 2k of them saved up.</p>\n<p>As for the drawings/photos/art/etc you can send them over at Memeseum.Showcase@gmail.com. Specify what you want to be displayed on the Artist's name, and if you so desire, a description/title for the piece.<br/></p>\n<p>I still have more things planned such as a way to change all of the paintings to whatever you choose, and multiplayer, stay tuned for more info on that.<br/></p>\n<p>The project was made to grow according to how much people know about it, the more people, the more memes and art you get to see! So be sure to share it!<br/></p>\n<p>This was made during the covid-19 Quarantine as a sort of escape to be able to see a museum while still being inside and safe.<br/></p>\n<p>My contact info:<br/> Plumar.mail@gmail.com<br/>@PlumarDEV<br/> (Opens in new tab)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T05:06:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e399e656143563e4f6b47daa5e701a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plumar"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
