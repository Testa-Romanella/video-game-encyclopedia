The real challenge of the game lies in \n      your ability to create chains of uninterrupted changing or elimination \n      of panels and connecting many chains to score big points.\n    </p><p>\n      Puzzle mode offers nearly 200 puzzles to solve, either in the One-Turn \n      or Chain categories, while Time Attack mode allows you to challenge \n      yourself to see how quickly you can eliminate a set number of panels. If \n      you\u2019re more into points, the goal of Score Attack mode is to see how \n      many points you can score within a set time limit (make the Spinnerator \n      appear and get into Fever Time to really maximize your score!) and Chain \n      Challenge mode is all about the number of chains you can make without \n      interruption.\n    </p><p>\n      Give Spin Six a whirl to discover its multiple modes and easy to master, \n      but deep, game play.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/319/319f578ba7462fd92d2fa49f197e7b9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
