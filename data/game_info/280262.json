(We\u2019ve checked with the scientists and it\u2019s the only way!)\r\n</p>\n<p>Save The Oceans is an arcade-style blaster developed using GameMaker Studio 2. Use a joypad to pilot your sub, button A will fire the blaster. Destroy any plastic-riddled lifeforms that come your way. Once destroyed they\u2019ll disperse their plastic fragments into the ocean, you must pick them up as they\u2019re used to charge your Superweapon! Avoid hitting the nasties, they hurt you. If you so wish, you can fire your Superweapon with button B, spitting laser death all around you. You have five charges to begin with, collect fragments to charge it up and get more.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Occasionally a toxic waste canister will drop into the ocean, pick it up to gain points. We\u2019re not sure who is dropping these canisters into the sea (probably some evil corporation) but one thing is for sure, if you manage to collect them in order, it makes your superiors very happy! There are usually ten per level, pick them up in numerical order for a Canister Collection bonus. If you pick any up in the wrong order, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s always next time. Collect all the canisters to complete the level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/883/88319e0e60a3434d7c519381bb6343c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cullitech"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
