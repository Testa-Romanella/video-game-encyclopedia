Each one with another take on the mechanics which can interact with each other to create more and more complex situations.<br/><br/><br/>With the help of the <strong>Undo/Redo</strong>-System, you can go back and forth in your steps, if you made a mistake or want to see the puzzle in an earlier state.<br/><br/><br/>If you need the numbers and positions in check, the Mark-System helps you out. An optional <strong>color pallete</strong> and <strong>pattern</strong> are available if needed.<br/><br/><br/>The Levels in the game are not enough?
