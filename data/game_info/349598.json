But once, our hero faced a threat he&#39;s not been prepared for. A secretive and well-organized organization has crept into the city. Trying to confront them, Hobo-Man cannot even imagine what kind of trouble he found himself knee deep in.<br />\nYou&#39;re about to become a hobosapien and sort out the mess in this breeding ground of human sin.
