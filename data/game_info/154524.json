The topic was randomly created by different word suggestions and was crapped out by a robot, the IdeaTron made by Tom Fulp. And we're not joking. It really crapped those ideas out.</p><p>Our topic for this Jam was 'Cows connecting flying Sharks'. Upon that topic, Team FuNaNdMoNo created the game 'Shark Antennas Corporation'.</p><p>The main goal in this game is to connect as many people as possible to the internet. To do so, you have to hit houses with sharks while flying above them with a helicopter. The more houses you hit, the more points you'll get. The better your score, the more you can brag about it when you submit it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d58/d585a1fe9d6a51f651a5d4c32b6ba7d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MonoFlauta"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
