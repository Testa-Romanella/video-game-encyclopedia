This is my second solo game jam project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to take care not to shatter the bottle you are holding. The bottle shatters when it hits the ground. However, it can land on floating platforms safely.\u00a0Throw the bottle into the small lightning storm at the end of the level to win.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Watch out for the Shock Bar at the bottom of the screen. When it fills up, your character gets shocked and automatically throws the bottle into the air. Throw the bottle manually to reset the Shock Bar.\u00a0Run to the bottle to catch it. See how fast you beat the level!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>A / D = Move Left &amp; Right<br/>SPACE = Jump<br/>Mouse Left-Click = Throw Bottle towards Mouse<br/><br/>Sources:<br/>Game made using Unity<br/>Art created using Pyxel Edit<br/>BGM made using Bosca Ceoil<br/>SoundFX sampled &amp; edited from Freesound.org<br/>Additional SoundFX generated from Bfxr.net<br/>More Info in the readme file</p>\n<p>Special Thanks:<br/>To Extra Credits for hosting the game jam.<br/>To Brackeys for the amazing Unity tutorials.<br/>To Extra Credits again for the entertaining game design and history YouTube content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dba/dba480322a42cd44f062177b6410b729.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["imoabura"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
