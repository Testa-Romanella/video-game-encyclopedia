{"id": 690740, "slug": "polity", "name": "Polity", "name_original": "Polity", "description": "   Polity is an online virtual world, where people can rule their own country or become citizens of other players' countries. This world offers you the opportunity to shape your own utopia with real players because it is a user-generated world. Establish your country, customize it, and set your own rules, or find a profession you are fond of as a citizen. Both choices will lead you to different paths. Alongside being a citizen, basic professions (such as farmer, forester, etc.) are designed to create a purpose-based atmosphere; in this way, players can internalize the profession on their way to being president. These professions consist of various quests and popular casual games, which are aimed to be educational and entertaining at the same time. <br/>   The game is set on a mysterious planet called Blue Dot 2 (BD-2). This planet is discovered by an AI-powered spaceship, JP-01G. The AI system collects data about this mysterious planet: It is mostly covered with water, but there is no sign of life. A new civilization is ready to build on BD-2: Platforms are waiting for their citizens. Here is where your journey begins. During this journey, you will find your own path while exploring the world you are comfortable in.
