The simple graphics hide a complex puzzle game, with easy to control and versatile movement, as well as interactive puzzle elements.</p>\n<p>Yeah I'm over selling it. I\u00a0enjoyed making this game. It was hard finding an aesthetic that worked well with the gameplay and concept, so I just went simple. Unfortunately due to the nature of the controls, which should be explained in game but there is an attached cheatsheat, it is gamepad only. I might make a future mouse and keyboard one if I\u00a0have time</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c6/3c66c9de7d397c953bd558e19bebddb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VIVID WORLD Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
