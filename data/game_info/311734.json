{"id": 311734, "slug": "metal-slug-5", "name": "Metal Slug 5", "name_original": "Metal Slug 5", "description": "<p>Metal Slug 5 is a run and gun video game for the Neo-Geo console/arcade platform created by SNK Playmore. It was released in 2003 for the MVS arcade platform, is the fifth game in the Metal Slug series, and was one of the last games for the Neo Geo system. The game was developed by Noise Factory/SNK Playmore, after Korean company Mega Enterprise had directed Metal Slug 4.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference from previous titles is the addition of the slide move, which allows the player to evade and maneuver in a new fashion. Unlike its predecessor Metal Slug 4, which reused many of the backgrounds from the previous games, Metal Slug 5 incorporates a wealth of new environments and backgrounds and features a more Heavy metal influenced soundtrack.</p>\n<p>It was later ported to Microsoft Xbox in Japan and North America only (not compatible with Xbox 360) and Sony PlayStation 2 as a stand-alone game in Japan and Europe, and along with Metal Slug 4 as a compilation in North America and South Korea. It was also ported to Microsoft Windows for a Korean release. A port was also released on Nintendo Switch in 2018.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-26T01:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/633/6334882482c86e4a37254dcae9a82e89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.78, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 13, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 16, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["Neo Geo"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
