Fill the sceen with\u00a0projectiles formed out of three core color elements, red, green and blue. Each of those core colors has their own characteristics, such as red making projectiles faster and explosive on contact. <br/><br/>Most colors you can embody are made from more than one core color. That means that they have attributes of all core colors they are made from. Violet projectiles? They will behave as red and blue combined.<br/><br/>I recommend playing your favourite music over it.<br/><br/>Have fun :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T05:41:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db4/db4c7e8c40d12d098d0d4d7a074ee922.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CyberMysticV"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
