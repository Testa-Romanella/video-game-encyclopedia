Lots of cars are driving your direction (well, actually you are driving their). The crash is impending. The only thing that can avoid it is your driving ability, your reflexes. The other cars won't change their way, you are the one that must use screenpad or tilt controls to switch between tracks and keep away from the others. How long will you last?\" Freeway Racer 2 comes with three different tracks, nice music tracks and candy eye looking graphics. The local highscore is ready for your best score. This game is very good for a short break, a typical casual game for kids and adults.
