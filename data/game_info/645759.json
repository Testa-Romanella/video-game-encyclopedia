{"id": 645759, "slug": "american-dead-zone-adz", "name": "American Dead Zone (ADZ)", "name_original": "American Dead Zone (ADZ)", "description": "<p>The ADZ (American Dead Zone) is a Destiny style patrol able area based in an evacuated city. Many years ago an\u00a0\u00a0alien race called the Hive took over the city and created a breading ground that supported their already enormous army. A true jewel of the Hive. With more than enough troops, the Hive went and crusaded across America. Taking over every city and town that they came across. They were unstoppable.</p>\n<p>Until one day when a rebellion retaliated in a small town on the west coast. That rebellion went on to grow and push back the Hive all the way to the city where they made their army.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now controlled by a warlord, the city is heavily fortified with barriers and checkpoints positioned throughout the streets. Buildings and Skyscrapers are used as shelters and command centers. But everyday the Hive try and take back their once glorious jewel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>With this project I wanted to work with a larger open space where players could use longer range weapons to take out enemies and have room for a public event that makes players move around between different locations. I also wanted to show off some smaller areas where the player is exposed to more melee enemies and forced to take their time when exploring around each corner.</p><p>---</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Barricade: Rohit.Pathak -\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/pg11rohit-barricade-7ae34895f2724eedacd2c9316c6d...</p><p>Commercial Truck: Daniel Zhabotinsky -\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/light-commercial-truck-07-low-poly-model-3be03b6...</p><p>Hummer: erty546453 -\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hmmwv-0530ca462dce4cdfb36b7a3695593a33</p><p>Aura 2 -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/aura-2-volumetric-...</p><p>Post Apocalyptic World Pack -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/post-apocalyptic-wor...</p><p>C.V.P Pine Woods -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/c-v-p-pine-woods-191942</p><p>All Sky -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/allsky-200-sky-s...</p><p>Gaia 2 -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gaia-2-terrain-scene-generat...</p><p>Rocks &amp; Boulders 2 -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/rock-and-boulders-2-6947</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T08:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d564e00e841a779ea49f6e3caa430000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mahrens1"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
