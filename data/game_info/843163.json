Wander around and search them. The character can move faster but that also creates more noises. So use it with caution!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can see how much noise you generate for the moment\u00a0on noise-meter on the bottom right. There is another meter on the top which shows how much \"awoken\" your neighbour is. If this is full you will loose the game.</p>\n<p>In order to get rid of your neighbours things you have to throw them away. This can be done by either \"opening\" a window and then throwing them out there or you can use the balcony. You might have to \"open\" the balcony door as well :-)</p>\r\nDev Journey\r\n<p>This game was made for the brackeys game jam and I joined it pretty late. So I had less than 3 days to make it. And due to timezones I by accident expected to have 8hrs more. Therefor I had to cut some corners.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But overall the core gameplay mechanic is there. I want to continue working on that game and would be really happy to get constructive feedback.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>I hope you enjoy playing the game.\u00a0</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T10:12:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd4/dd4491dd6668e9abb57842c98c0a3f0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
