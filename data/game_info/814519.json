{"id": 814519, "slug": "r-beta-eng-usa", "name": "R-BETA (ENG-USA)", "name_original": "R-BETA (ENG-USA)", "description": "<p>A combination of the action and difficulty of the Classic Mega Man with the exploration of an interconnected map in the best Metroidvania style.<br/><br/></p>\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\n<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>:<br/><br/> You were abducted and now you are in a huge extraterrestrial base. It's up to you (R-BETA), with the help of your subsidiary (T-DELTA), to escape and return to the Main Mission.<br/> <br/><br/><strong>BASIC KEYBOARD CONTROLS</strong>:<br/> <br/>[ \u2190 / \u2192 ] WALK;<br/> [Z] JUMP; <br/>[ X ] SHOOT; <br/>[ F ] TOGGLE - FULL SCREEN / WINDOWED. <br/><br/><br/><strong>PROS</strong>:<br/> <br/>* The game is challenging, with a huge variety of obstacles and puzzles that will force you to think outside the box, using your available skills creatively. In some cases it is necessary to combine multiple skills to progress in your adventure;<br/> <br/>* Battles against Bosses (two for now) that will test the limits of your agility;<br/> <br/>* Secret passages and illusory walls, rewarding the most attentive players;<br/> <br/>* Retro music and graphics, inspired by 8-bit and 16-bit games;<br/> <br/>* Supports XInput (XBOX Controller). <br/><br/><br/><strong>CONS</strong>:<br/> <br/>* Difficulty may discourage casual players. The game is aimed at the \"hardcore\" audience. Still, it is possible to open the \"PASSWORD\"s menu (TAB on the keyboard / START on the XBOX controller), which allows you to enter the following cheat codes: <br/><br/>\"GODMODE ON\" - activates invulnerability; <br/>\"GODMODE OFF\" - disables invulnerability; <br/>\"1 HIT KO ON\" - activates fatal shot; <br/>\"1 HIT KO OFF\" - disables fatal shot. <br/><br/>But as a developer, I suggest you to NOT DO THAT! The fun of the game lies in the satisfaction of overcoming difficult obstacles. The PASSWORD menu is ONLY included for those who can't progress despite numerous attempts, but still want to know what happens in the game;<br/> <br/>* R-BETA is still in development. There are paths that lead to nothing, but the good news is that I am developing new areas as you read this. Updates will be made constantly, however, I'm working on this project alone, so a new release might take a while to come out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T12:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/915/915fb52c49b481cac216344bd32867db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DougMR"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
