{"id": 777583, "slug": "grab-em-all-2", "name": "Grab Em' All!", "name_original": "Grab Em' All!", "description": "<p>\"Grab Em' All\" is a claw-machine simulator where\u00a0you get to play as a claw and collect stuffed animals. The bigger the stuffed animal, the harder it is to get. But the rewards are so much better!<br/><br/>Play by yourself, or play with a (nearby) friend. Race against the clock to collect as many of the stuffed animals as you can. The bigger and more difficult the animals are, the more points and time you'll get.\u00a0<br/><br/>=======================</p>\n<p>This game was created in under a week as a project for a class! It is a\u00a0(heavily) modified version of Rocket Patrol - the APF-M1000 built-in gallery shooter, built using Phaser 3.<br/>Feedback would very much be appreciated!<br/><br/>=======================</p>\n<p>Background Music: \"Powerup!\" by Jeremy Blake</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T14:57:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4b/a4b3d253a53af863d50b48a3282a1941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael Lamore"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
