Only Kshatriya and Vaishya who pay their great respects to Brahmana can be admitted into Brahmanism. The young maiden had worshiped the Sun very religiously and God selected her and tried her within her dream on Brahmanism. <br/><br/><br/><br/>A Deity is also interested in that religion because Brahmanism keeps ancient magic that is so-called Chakra. The Sun has great Chakra which can attract matters by solar rays and the shrine has worshiped the Sun as the merciful God. <br/><br/><br/><br/>A ordinary girl often visited the shrine in which the Sun is worshiped as God. Those who want to live a happy life are very interested in how to be lucky. The girl was not an exception. She knew Vedas as a superstition before she became ridden by Vedas. <br/><br/>She had knowledge about four Varnas but she didn't know how to become Kshatriya or Vaishya. She sometime heard about Caste in her neighborhood but she felt like something was not quite right about the meaning of Caste.<h3>Game Style</h3><ul><li>JRPG is main style in the game. </li></ul><ul><li>When camera control is locked, feature of adventure becomes the main.</li></ul><ul><li>It is something like dark fantasy and dark jokes.</li></ul><ul><li>Quick learning of Brahmanism is the main theme.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T06:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0af/0af4770d5b7ed238cd824e08cf819660.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brahmana \"Perfect\""], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Brahmana \"Perfect\""], "esrb_rating": null}
