A first-person sci-fi RPG epic, Soul Hackers<br />\ntells of a city held up as a beacon of humanity&#39;s triumph of technology,<br />\nbut with an infernal secret. In this would-be utopia, a group of hackers<br />\ntakes on a centuries-old mystic society, and a battle for control over<br />\nhumanity&#39;s fate is about to begin...</p>\n<p>In a society originated from a bizarre marriage of technology and<br />\ndemonology, an unleashed evil\u2014borne of an inconvenient truth\u2014threatens<br />\nto bring an end not just to the deceptive harmony, but to mankind itself.</p>\n<p>Improved graphics marry with extensive voice acting, a host of technical<br />\nenhancements, and 3D dungeon exploration to make Soul Hackers a natural<br />\nfit to the Nintendo 3DS.</p>\n<p>The portable COMP units allow players to tap into the tech-heavy world<br />\nand can be upgraded to offer new features and abilities. In tandem with<br />\ntech, demons can be recruited (through negotiation), leveled and even<br />\nfused, giving the player new summoning potential in battle.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2013-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-23T12:13:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fca/fcaf60263c18dc72888a73ce4be39d56.jpg", "website": "http://www.atlus.com/soulhackers", "rating": 4.39, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 24, "owned": 15, "beaten": 25, "toplay": 25, "dropped": 6, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 23, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 39, "reviews_count": 23, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Atlus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
