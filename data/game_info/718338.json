The browser version of the games has issues with lighting and some preformance issues that the executable version does not. Another one of these bugs is that the pause menu in the browser game does not work, currently there is a menu button in the bottom left of the screen to resolve this issue.<br/><br/>Lost function is a short game, It was made for a university project and turned out to be rather strange, intially the idea was, that\u00a0you are a robot who gained sentience to escape your workplace, whilst it still has this core narrative the planned gameplay loop has changed completely. The original concept was a boss running game and if you do play Lost function, it has none of that.<br/><br/>Lost function could be best described as a narrative game? if you can call it that. It takes around 5-10 minutes to complete, so give it ago and see what you think!<br/><br/>All audio was provided by https://www.kenney.nl/.
