As a mixture of card based strategy and bullet hell action, our game caters to players who find the average deck builder too slow. Developed in Unity and coded in C#, our project utilizes the Unity ECS framework to maximize the number of simultaneous projectile and player interactions. \u201cGenre-busting\u201d is when an artist or author combines established styles into a unique and revolutionary experience for consumers. In \u201cGenre Busters\u201d, players construct decks with up to two different \u201cgenres\u201d, allowing them to find unique and expressive ways to defeat their opponents in 1-on-1 combat. </p>\n<p>Game currently best played online with Parsec or with 2 keyboards locally.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Player 1<ul><li>Left (A)</li><li>Right (D)</li><li>Up (W)</li><li>Down (S)</li><li>Card 1 (U)</li><li>Card 2 (I)</li><li>Card 3 (O)</li><li>Card 4 (P)</li></ul></li><li>Player 2<ul><li>Left (Left Arrow)</li><li>Right (Right Arrow)</li><li>Up (Up Arrow)</li><li>Down (Down Arrow)</li><li>Card 1\u00a0(V)</li><li>Card 2 (B)</li><li>Card 3 (N)</li><li>Card 4 (M)</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T05:25:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/501/50192404704ef2c4435cb56ad005e4aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheKeaver", "Miselia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
