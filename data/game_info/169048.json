Sale-Mart, where the deals are great, the products are large, and you'll be running out of space in your wallet with all the savings! The only catch is: you only keep everything if you complete your shopping list, anything you scan past that is extra savings!</p>\n<p>Sale-Mart has also been so gracious as to leave you a top of the line, vintage (and slightly rickety) cart to haul around your savings! There may not be much room in it, but nobody said you couldn't make multiple trips!<br/></p>\n<p>Current build has a hard coded 5 minute timer and gives you a random shopping list to complete. Scan objects at self-checkout in order to remove the item from your shopping list. <br/></p>\n<p>See if you can actually complete the round! If you can, leave a comment!</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks and Credits</strong></p>\n<p>- Quill18 and Tim Ruswick for providing entertainment on Twitch while slogging through development</p>\n<p>- Bit Orchestra (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfvVKAi3oNbXUPe_KUTRX8Q) for the royalty free store music<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/745/745b0281c2377a31dc6a86afd27a5aaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhyNXT"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
