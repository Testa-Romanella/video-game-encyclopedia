It\u2019s hard to tell who you\u2019re fighting, as they all claim to be Alpharius. Watch out, they may have agents in your ranks...<br/></li><li> <strong>Night Lords</strong>: They come unseen and terrorize their opponents so that they can\u2019t fight back.</li></ul><br/>In addition, three Neutral factions provide support for all Legions that want it:<br/><ul><li> <strong>Chaos</strong>: the Chaos Gods are aiding Horus and his allies, but the Loyalists aren\u2019t immune to corruption. The power of chaos, however, can be fatally unwieldy.<br/></li><li> <strong>Imperial Army</strong>: the countless men and women unable to compete against the Astartes in single combat, but who can overwhelm them with sheer numbers and ingenuity.<br/></li><li> <strong>Mechanicum</strong>: seekers of knowledge from the Dark Age of Technology who supply weapons and vehicles, as well as aiding with their own armies and Titan Legions.</li></ul><br/><strong>More Legions will come in future expansions!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-07T11:39:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/ada4b28eb7ccf70bf47a9ba4415868bc_yRJj281.jpg", "website": "http://www.horusheresylegions.com/", "rating": 2.71, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 255, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 461, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Everguild"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Everguild"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
