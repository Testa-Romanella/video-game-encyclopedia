Again, possibly not my greatest writing either but I've tried to focus more on actually learning how to use the tool in order to get <em>something</em> made.\u00a0Hopefully, you'll enjoy it though :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T18:16:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f10/f10977533e1850233951648596a4bb54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ar\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc8e"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
