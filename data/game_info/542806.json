So if you have the ability to play it through the download please do.\u00a0The play in browser version works-ish\u00a0but isn't a great representation of our project. More info in the description below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This our first game\u00a0and our very\u00a0first game jam as a team, we worked super hard on it. and learned a ton over this 2 week\u00a0long jam.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you enjoy and please leave any feedback in the comments!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zack Knapp - Art Design</p>\n<p>James Knapp - Music\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joe Knapp\u00a0\u00a0- Developer\u00a0</p>\n<p>You're a blood cell attempting to gather all the platelets before the time runs out! *Platelets give you bonus time.\u00a0You dash with the pulse of the\u00a0(Heart) beat.\u00a0Use your bounciness and the pulse \u00a0to your advantage. Sound On.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0Mouse position\u00a0-\u00a0for rotating and aiming your dash</p>\n<p>W - for additional forward movement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0S - to slow down. (you don't really need it).</p>\n<p>R - to restart</p>\n<p>For the play in browser mode, its quite garbled. I only kept it up because the core game still \u00a0works and for the non Mac users who would still\u00a0like to play of course!\u00a0Lighting, tempo, animations, and\u00a0artwork are all out of wack.\u00a0 I couldn't for the life of me figure out what settings I needed to adjust to fit the WebGL format. If anyone has any insight on the issue I'd love some feedback. Side note the Quit button\u00a0wasn't working for the browser version either, it just kinda freezes the game. So\u00a0you'll\u00a0have to close the tab\u00a0when your done. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T03:44:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ac/6ac5e7f55ef428de066b778d6f988dc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Jknapp"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
