Learned some new stuff in the process, such as coroutines. I made some slight additions to the help screen, but otherwise the game is mostly identical to the Flash version.</p>\n<p>All code and game design is by me. Land, water, and trap sprite is by me.\u00a0Music, player, and creature sprites are by Nintendo. Tree sprite is not by me, but I can't remember where I got it from.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T06:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/014b25ec8efce1c442b1651e1a27baff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mike Murray"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
