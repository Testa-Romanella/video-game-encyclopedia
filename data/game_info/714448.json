Keeny arts is amazing and used for this project, the robot (Steve) was missing a sword, so I had the honor to add that to him to make him ever more cuter than he is. No need to thank me, just doing good to the world of gaming.<br/>The bgm used in the game is original, and it was supposed to be for the Cozy gamejam which unfortunately I couldn't make it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a85b4fdc206ee3250f63119d4459761.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mikado"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
