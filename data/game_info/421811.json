This brought some interesting mechanics to the game. For elder players there's a time challenge play mode, which brings fun and joy with this casual pretty platform game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T02:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d10/d109967a72e31f85586cd43e0c32f294.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mateusz Ko\u0142odziejczyk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
