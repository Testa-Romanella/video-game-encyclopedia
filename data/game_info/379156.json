(Suus)", "description": "<p><strong>What is it?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is the first out of 10 in the \"One Game A Week\" Project.\u00a0The theme for the first week is: jump. So we made a little game where you can..... exactly: jump!</p>\n<p><strong>Is it good?</strong></p>\n<p>Overall this little game isn't too great, but for myself I am very happy with it. I learned a lot! I have never made a platformer before. This was interesting. Also to work with other scripts (provided by Unity) and my own or mixing these. It is all at a very beginner level, but it sure felt great making this. Working with my own assets and assets from the Unity store (which should be clearly visible :') ) was a new and cool experience. Putting my own audio in. All in all I felt a lot of joy making this. The game itself is barely a game: in case you are interested in downloading it. Do as you like. Check it out maybe!</p>\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n<p><strong>Who am I?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I am a Game Design student enrolled at the University of Europe in Berlin.
