PPM was founded by Maro, a sentient android, and is frequented by many pizza fans in the city.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Next up is Nou-Raex\u2014a planet not too far from CobeeDot that is rich in plants. Teenager Norx loves the quietude of the morning and enjoys his walks in the swamp.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- The third planet we visit is called Eskolea (or \"Downpourlea\" to its inhabitants). This rather dystopian planet is characterized by rainy, stormy, cloudy days and nights. Somewhat eerie that it's a rainless night all of a sudden...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach puzzle consists of 144 pieces and takes about 30-60 minutes to complete. Featuring comic-style drawings, illustrative descriptions and a beautiful, soothing soundtrack, Pieces I introduces you to the universe of the Maskros Nebula and some iconic characters you will meet in later (narrative) owly crow games.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T12:07:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/955/9559612803139daa4aaccc5fc7df50be.jpg", "website": "https://owlycrow.myportfolio.com/pieces-i-a-maskros-nebula-game", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["owly crow"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["owly crow"], "esrb_rating": null}
