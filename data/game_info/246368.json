It is currently in development and this build has few minor glitches</p>\n<p>I'll be keep updating this project as often as I\u00a0can!</p>\n\n<p>PUZZLES THAT WORK PROPERLY</p>\n<p>- Lute; Tune 12 string medieval lute to proper notes. To compensate work-in-progress project, knob will be highlighted to different color when in a proper note</p>\n<p>- Harmony Path; available after going through second cave. Go through mountain path that plays chords. Your task is to go through proper progress of chords that is listed on the entrance</p>\n\n<p>---- SEP. 24th / 2018\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently existing glitches / unfinished\u00a0<br/>- Flute puzzle doesn't check for the right answer correctly. Just punch 6 holes and then event will be triggered<br/>- Orchestra puzzle is just a place holder (A theatre), has no event attached<br/>- Harmony Path puzzle works, but randomly overlaps more than two chords at once. If that happens, try tracking back a post then go back<br/>- After going through right path on Harmony Path, an animation that is triggered using mine shaft may not switch back to player camera proper,y. In that case try press Esc key</p>\n\n<p>-- FUTURE FIXES</p>\n<p>- Flute puzzle</p>\n<p>- Orchestra puzzle</p>\n<p>- Puzzles that I\u00a0had originally planned that are not currently in this build</p>\n<p>- Footsteps sound that go wild time to time</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d4937cfcf05c6eaecf4b072caf7b4723.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jihwoanahn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
