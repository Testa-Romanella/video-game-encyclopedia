This game is a rogue-like city-builder where you face off against Waves of Waves. Manage resources and grow your island city against traditional calamities like Tidal Waves and more obscure occurrences like deadly Waves of Cats! The city begins with a base level amount of happiness. Each disaster reminds the citizens why they should move away. Run out of happiness, and the game is over! Upgrade your buildings to improve resource generation and produce the ultimate building to make everyone more happy. Use Red building structures to protect against certain types of disasters, but this resource only regenerates slowly over time.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Brian Cronin<br/>Progamming, Design<br/><br/>Ingo Duarte<br/>Music and Sound FX</p>\n<p>Selam Kebede<br/>Music and\u00a0Sound FX</p>\n<p>Kevin Holmes<br/>Design and Art: Voxel buildings, icons<br/><br/>John Treviranus<br/>Design and Art: Voxel buildings, world<br/><br/>Christian Strohm<br/>Design, sound programming</p>\n<p>Ray Hernandez<br/>Title screen artwork</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ef/1ef6d25f931836910f819d39ebadfb48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseki"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
