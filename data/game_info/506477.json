{"id": 506477, "slug": "tree-cut", "name": "Tree cut", "name_original": "Tree cut", "description": "<p>In\u00a0game theory, a\u00a0<strong>game tree</strong>\u00a0is a\u00a0directed graph\u00a0whose\u00a0nodes\u00a0are positions in a\u00a0game\u00a0and whose\u00a0edges\u00a0are moves. The\u00a0<strong>complete game tree</strong>\u00a0for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the\u00a0extensive-form game\u00a0representation.</p>\n<p>The first two plies of the game tree for tic-tac-toe.</p>\n<p>The diagram shows the first two levels, or\u00a0<em>plies</em>, in the game tree for\u00a0tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.</p>\n<p>The number of\u00a0leaf nodes\u00a0in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.</p>\n<p>Game trees are important in\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using any of numerous\u00a0tree search\u00a0algorithms, combined with\u00a0minimax-like rules to\u00a0prune the tree. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like\u00a0chess\u00a0are much too large to search. Instead, a\u00a0chess-playing program\u00a0searches a\u00a0<strong>partial game tree</strong>: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available.
