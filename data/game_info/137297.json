A match-3 2D survival shooter where the aim is to get the highest score possible while killing clones of yourself and arranging\u00a0 3\u00a0 of the same tiles in a row.</p>\n<p>The theme for this Ludum Dare is: <strong>Combining two incompatible genres.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Inside the Cave of Mimicry, periodic blackouts occur, where there is a chance of some tiles being rearranged and some deadly clones of yourself spawning. The more blackouts that occur, the more chance that you will encounter your clone.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was made in 48 hours for the compo.</p>\n<p><strong>How to use your weapons:</strong></p>\n<p>Shotgun: A close range weapon but unlike a pistol (your normal weapon) it has a larger blast radius meaning you can shoot past blocks.</p>\n\n<p>Grenade launcher: A mid-range weapon that can destroy any coloured tiles as well as enemies.</p>\n\n<p>Sniper: A long-range weapon. Move your cursor to the enemy and press spacebar and watch them pop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rate my game on Ludum Dare here</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Engine: Unity</p>\n<p>Art: Inkscape</p>\n<p>Animation: Spriter2D</p>\n<p>Music/Sound: Bosca Ceoil<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5ffe22e476dd5988ca6e5cd9424b213.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["m.zadz"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
