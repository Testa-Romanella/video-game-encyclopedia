By using\u00a0one stick the player can move the character around the screen and with the other they can use it to aim their cross hair to line up targets to shoot. This provides a tactical advantage to the player as they no longer have to be lined up in front of an enemy to shoot it. This also provides a challenge as they have to pay attention to both their position as well as aiming the cross hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This version of Locus Flux is a \"Proof of Concept\" version. The game is still currently being developed by Sun Eater Systems. This is not the finished game and a final version will be released.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller required. Keyboard and Mouse controls coming soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5e/f5e5234c17a769cd306688396a54b762.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MatthewRGoode", "SunEaterSystems", "Dillon Lynch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
