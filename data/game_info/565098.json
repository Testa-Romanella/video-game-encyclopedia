It's a short one that only takes a few minutes of your day. But sometimes, a few minutes is all it takes to make a difference in someone's life. Let's all make a difference, for the better, in the lives of those around us no matter how great or small. \u2665<br/></p>\n<p>To be honest, I didn't get a chance to start working on this until February 24th. I did as much as I could with my idea over the course of 4 days. It was difficult to still try to capture the essence of the game with just a single scenario but I'm hoping it still reaches those who play. In the future I plan on adding the 2 scenarios mentioned in game as well as a few others I had written up.</p><p>Wishing you all the love and kindness you deserve in life! \u2665<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb8fc9cd46faeb3887b22af7c4035e39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flawestruck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
