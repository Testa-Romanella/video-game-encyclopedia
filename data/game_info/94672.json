Members must wager the object they care for more than any other: their\u00a0Prized Possession.\u00a0Florentine\u00a0has seven days to prove herself. Each night pits her against one of the quirky characters clamoring to gain control of her trophy.\u00a0<br/><br/>But what happens when members leave? And why are\u00a0Prized Possessions\u00a0such an integral part of\u00a0FOIL's structure? As her experience in the isolated\u00a0Chateau de l'Hiver\u00a0proves menacing,\u00a0Florentine\u00a0investigates what evolves into a mysterious and ugly truth.\u00a0<br/><br/>PREMISE AND THEME<br/><br/>Fleuret Blanc\u00a0is primarily about the importance of objects in our life. Though the storyline follows\u00a0Florentine\u00a0as she unravels the mysteries of\u00a0FOIL\u00a0and its judges, she's constantly challenged with ideas of possession, collection, and obsession. The game rewards\u00a0Florentine--who starts as a minimalist traveler--with points based not only on how much she interacts with her fellow members, but also on how much money she makes and how many items she's hoarded in her room. Though collecting is encouraged for a better score, the overall implications of the act can be bittersweet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d076aed193970a05efd7167ae46bb019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Merlandese"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
