{"id": 392714, "slug": "counterpoint", "name": "Counterpoint", "name_original": "Counterpoint", "description": "<p>In music, a counterpoint is a compositional technique where a set of distinct melodies are played in conjunction with each other according to a set of fixed rules. This idea, (in a heavily simplified form), is the basis of Counterpoint.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to\u00a0match a given musical pattern by placing towers on a grid. A central tower will send out an energy pulse at the start of each cycle, and any towers that are hit by this pulse will play a note and then send out a pulse of their own. The pitch the note that each tower plays (low, medium, or high) depends on the color of the space it is placed on.</p>\n<p>In each level, you will be given a melody to copy. Your goal\u00a0is to link the towers together so that they play this melody. Each stage consists of 5 levels (and 5 melodies). When you complete a stage, all of the melodies from that stage will play together, creating a primitive musical counterpoint.</p>\n<p>Made for the TAGD 2019 Spring Game Jam.
