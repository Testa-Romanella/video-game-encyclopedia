I'm a huge fan of Undertale and this boss battle in particular, since it was such a departure from the rest of the game. So, obviously that meant that I had to remake it from scratch.</p>\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>Move: <em>Arrow Keys</em><br/>Action: <em>Z or Enter</em><br/>Dodge as much as you can, call out for help, and fight to take down Flowey!</p>\n\r\nVisual Epilepsy Warning\r\n<p>Warning! This game contains flashing lights, static, and other such patterns, which could be potentially harmful to those who experience visual epilepsy! Play at your own risk, and take care!</p>\n\r\nSpoilers\r\n<p>This fan game has massive spoilers for the neutral ending of Undertale! So, if you haven't already, do yourself a favor and go play Undertale! It holds a very special place in my heart, and perhaps it will in yours, too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/327/327e1be28e8365a75d11e19fb4e28c3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["barkScript"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
