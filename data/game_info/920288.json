However, your people and buildings are all living plants, so you have to carefully balance your resources and keep the soil healthy in order to sustainably thrive. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow keys: move camera</li><li>Scroll wheel: zoom camera</li><li>Mouse: interact with everything\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing you do is place your World Tree. This will be the center of your growing town, and growing the Tree is your main objective. The Tree will grow roots out over time, and all your other buildings need to be connected to these roots in order to work. We recommend building your Tree by the river in the northeast of the map so that you can start off with water absorbing plants close by. <br/></p>\n<p>Start by placing Nurseries and Water Plants to get a good production of food and water early on! Villagers need to eat food, and both villagers and buildings consume water. If you click on a Nursery you can also switch it to producing new Villagers for your town (at the cost of fertilizer).<br/></p>\n<p>Villagers will automatically work any building or natural formation that they can, but this isn't always efficient. If you click on a villager you can bring up a menu where you can change what type of job the villager will look for. <br/></p>\n<p>Your buildings will all absorb nutrients out of the ground\u00a0in\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0sustain\u00a0themselves.
