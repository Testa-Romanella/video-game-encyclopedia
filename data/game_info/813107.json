To make things worse (or just weirder), the great library has been converted into a maze filled with a gauntlet of dastardly foes! What\u00a0<em>is </em>Patchy's deal? Could she be jealous? But of <em>who?</em></p>\n<p>A seamless blend of\u00a0first person dungeon crawling with fast-paced action RPG combat, explore the magical maze as Alice while fighting off foes as her doll, Shanghai.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: THIS GAME IS STILL INCOMPLETE...\u00a0but it shouldn't be much longer now!
