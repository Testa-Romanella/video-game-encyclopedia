We were tasked with creating 3 unique levels for a simple 3D walk around project for Unity class. I designed all three levels using a few free asset packs from the Unity Store.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 WASD</strong> - <em>Move</em></p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Spacebar</strong> - <em>Jump</em></p>\n<p>Click the objects found at the end of each level to load the next. There are three levels in total, but the last one doesn't take you anywhere (and that little beast does nothing but look cool!)</p>\n<p><strong>Important to note:</strong>\u00a0Please take care not to jump off of or fall off the ground plane/levels. I never rigged any colliders to stop your player, so you'll fall forever! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74f3fbc67ab8b76d9fcab081cf03237c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mooch Rex"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
