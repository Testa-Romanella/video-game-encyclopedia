Dredgers are the men and monsters who all desire the gold and power lying in the dungeons beneath the earth. As a dredger you'll be exploring dungeons, looking for gold, potions, scrolls, food and more to further your endless descent into the depths. <br/><br/>As you slay enemies in your way, you'll earn experience which affords you higher stats, new classes and new skills. Deflect enemy projectiles as a fencer or call down devastating beams of light as a priest. Maybe you prefer leaving the grunt work to your followers as a summoner or lich? Or perhaps you prefer having excellent equipment instead, taking the blacksmith and artificer classes.<br/><br/>Even better, why not be all of the above? Dredgers places very little restrictions on classes, allowing you to combine them to your heart's content.<br/><br/><br/>As of release, Dredgers has the following features:<br/><ul><li>30 races to play and unlock.<br/></li><li>40+ classes to skill into, with a myriad of possible builds.<br/></li><li>Endless dungeon with 4 themed zones, and 3 challenging sub-zones.<br/></li><li>253 items and equipment, ranging from torches and food to powerful staves, enchanted swords and more.<br/></li><li>Majority of equipment and items can be crafted using specialized class skills and materials found throughout the dungeon.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T02:58:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/503508a55c770f04c2a3bcc9c530b600.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 13, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pirate-Rob"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pirate-Rob"], "esrb_rating": null}
