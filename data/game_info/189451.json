Aether has caused previous methods of\r\npropulsion and scientific observation to become unreliable, so our\r\nleading researchers have developed a new probe, capable of utilizing\r\nelectromagnetic charges to glide through the aether.  These new\r\nprobes, the Aether Kites, shall deliver sensors to specially selected\r\nplanets for further research and surveying!</p>\n<p>Guide the deployed\r\nAether Kite to the target planet in each cluster by toggling the \u00a0charge between\r\npositive and negative charges (Mouse 1), to manage your momentum and\r\ndirection.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And try not to crash too many; we\u2019re not made out of\r\nmoney!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fea/fea062a064b8baf83f8b9328ae72e57d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GeneralJMan"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
