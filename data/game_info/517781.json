Sufferers slowly lose their sanity over time and have constant visions of the missing Vtuber \"Akai Haato\". You must complete a ritual to rid yourself of the syndrome or lose your sanity all together.\u00a0</p><p>3 Different Endings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>E/LMB - Interact</p>\n<p>F - Flashlight</p>\n<p>ESC - Pause</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your flashlight requires no batteries however slowly drains over time. Keeping it off will help charge it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Your character is able to sprint forwards and backwards for a short time, however keep an eye on your stamina meter because when it runs out you're unable to move for a few seconds. Enough time for Haachama to catch up to you.</p>\n<p>She always knows where you are, so keep moving.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music from:</p>\n<p>Daniel Curtis\u00a0\u00a0Website\u00a0||\u00a0Youtube Channel<br/></p>\n<p>Alex Chaves\u00a0 Website\u00a0||\u00a0Youtube Channel ||\u00a0Freesound</p>\n<p>Legend1060\u00a0Freesound</p>\n<p>Models from:</p>\n<p>Hololive\u00a0\u00a0Official Website ||\u00a0Official Youtube Channel</p>\n<p>\u00a0Berk Gedik\u00a0 Website\u00a0||\u00a0Sketchfab</p>\n<p>DavidFischer\u00a0Website ||\u00a0Sketchfab<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This non-commerical fan game is a derivative work of Cover Corp's Hololive property.
