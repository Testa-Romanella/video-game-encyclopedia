The game was released in Japan, North America and Europe in 2001. It is the first F-Zero game to be released on a handheld game console.<br />\nMaximum Velocity takes place twenty-five years after F-Zero, in yet another F-Zero Grand Prix. The past generations of F-Zero had &quot;piloted their way to fame&quot;, so it is the only F-Zero game without Captain Falcon, Samurai Goroh, Pico, or Dr. Stewart. Players control fast hovering crafts and use their speed-boosting abilities to navigate through the courses as quickly as possible.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2001-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T12:52:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0d4/0d46592c6d7c8420f6fbc9340ad35444.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.14, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 5, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Nd Cube"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
