However, Nintendo had considered releasing the game in North America, but never did for reasons unknown. It stayed on Nintendo Power&#39;s future release list for a few years, until the release of the next title of the series, Custom Robo: Battle Revolution for the Nintendo GameCube (known as Custom Robo in North America). NOISE was also planning to develop the sequel, Custom Robo GX 2 but later dropped from the lineup in favor of Custom Robo Arena for the Nintendo DS. Nintendo previously planned to release it in late 2005 in Japan. Custom Robo GX is the third title of the Custom Robo series as well as the last Custom Robo title never released outside Japan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-24T09:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/231/2310e59dedb84aeb856e50b4f36dc9c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Noise"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
