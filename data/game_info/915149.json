Get to meet the charismatic Whateverlanders, steal and deceive or be a good boy to discover all the different endings of Vincent's story.<br/></p>\n<p>Find your way out of a magical prison called Whateverland with a charming ghost Nick by your side, get to meet the charismatic locals, steal and deceive or be a good boy and help others to discover all the different endings to this bizarre adventure.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Each level can be completed in at least two different ways: you either steal from people or help them. The rich branching dialogues will tell you more about the world and its inhabitants, as well as influence your relationship with Whateverlanders and your sidekick Nick.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There is no particular order of chapters in this game. More than that, if you ever feel stuck, you can drop your current chapter at any point in the story, and move to another one. And then another one. And another... You get the point.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Whateverland features 19 mini-games in total, although you won\u2019t be able to complete all of them in a single playthrough. Along with challenges like giving a tattoo to a merman and making top-notch ramen (you know, the usual), on the path of a thief you will encounter a variety of locks simply begging to be cracked.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T06:48:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b5/5b5f61503f3abd4eac2fe48a6d26951a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Caligari Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
