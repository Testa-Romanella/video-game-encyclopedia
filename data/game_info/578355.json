But I'll be playing around in it looking for crashes after the upload.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyways...</p>\n<p>Your old pal, the\u00a0White Rabbit? Well he needs some help. He's late for a Tea part of Sorts and need's your help.</p>\n<p>Collect as many mushrooms as you can before time runs out or you die.</p>\n<p>Avoid or kill\u00a0Shroombeasts that spawn, to collect the mushrooms they drop.</p>\n<p>Mushrooms you collect will NOT be scored unless you bring them back to the White Rabbit. At that point he will take your mushrooms and you will be cleansed of any ill effects. You may drop off mushrooms as many times as you like. But the deeper you go, the more risk you take getting back. Is it worth it? I don't know. The mushroom scoring is probably unbalanced, gimme a break.\u00a0 Just play it for the experience. lol</p>\n<p>*Notes:</p>\n<p>There are 6 different mushrooms. Some more rare than others. Each one with a different effect.</p>\n<p>Yellow Mushroom- 1 Point Health<br/></p>\n<p>Purple\u00a0 Mushroom- Spawn More Shroombeasts</p>\n<p>Red Mushroom-?</p>\n<p>Pyramid Mushroom-??</p>\n<p>Grey Mushroom - ????</p>\n<p>??? Mushroom - ?????</p>\n\n<p>*Controls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D to Move, Space to Jump (You can Double Jump)</p>\n<p>K to Light Attack</p>\n<p>L to Heavy Attack</p>\n<p>There is a combo you can do.\u00a0 That will kill a Shroombeast in a single chain. Just mash around. Shouldn't be hard.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Alice: </strong>I\u00a0Recolored this sprite set\u00a0https://clembod.itch.io/warrior-free-animation-set</p>\n<p><strong>TileSet:</strong>\u00a0https://aamatniekss.itch.io/free-pixelart-tileset-cute-forest</p>\n<p>and\u00a0https://aamatniekss.itch.io/free-pixelart-platformer-tileset<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mushrooms:\u00a0</strong>https://ssugmi.itch.io/fantasy-mushroom-pack</p>\n<p><strong>Enemy:\u00a0</strong>https://luizmelo.itch.io/monsters-creatures-fantasy</p>\n<p><strong>Mushroom Spring:\u00a0</strong>https://ansimuz.itch.io/sunnyland-enemies-extended-pack</p>\n<p>All sounds and music\u00a0found through\u00a0https://freesound.org/<br/></p>\n<p>or\u00a0https://sidearm-studios.itch.io/ultimate-sound-fx-bundle</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T04:13:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35b/35b66ec9acb26319bc4996b8305019b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BobIsHere"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
