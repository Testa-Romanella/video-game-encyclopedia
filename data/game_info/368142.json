They soon discover the town is the beginning of a strange and mysterious journey... <br/><br/>Lifeless Moon is a spiritual successor to our previous title Lifeless Planet (PC/Mac/Linux/XB1/PS4). Featuring support for VR (but playable without!), Lifeless Moon takes players on a fantastic journey through the eyes of Apollo-era astronauts. There will be light platforming and a deeper focus on puzzles than in Lifeless Planet.
