Although.....they may not be the ones you were hoping for....\r\n</p>\n<p>///\r\n</p>\n<p>Last month I spent a weekend chasing a silly idea that hit me like a basketball to the head, and it turned into: Monthly Dragon Oracle. Which\u00a0is an incredibly short little game that sprung from my personal frustration trying to make words...work and to find a creative use of the scribbles in my notebook.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed it so much that I decided to keep it going. 30 new randomized fortunes! New backgrounds. Same weird dragon joy with the Great Oracle.</p>\n<p>Have a good day and enjoy!\r\n</p>\n<p>///\r\n</p>\n<p>If there's any issues &amp;/ if it doesn't cycle back to the original screen in the end, please let me know and which fortune you received that time.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T08:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c0/7c07bfa722e393d4f70b5a0d4784ce3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Icefire149"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
