I\u00a0have a simple pipeline and try to keep my development on that pipeline. Purpose of this challenge is to get more experience in making complete games and try new technologies or methods of development, what I never did, plus I'm getting more experience in storytelling, composition, design, time consuming, etc., so this challenge is really helpful for me.</p>\r\nOk, challenge. But what about game itself?\r\n<p>This particular game is first in challenge and I'm glad that I didn't get visual novel or smth similar. I got survival horror. I never made survival horrors, so this experience is something else. You will see creepy enemies, \"Granny\" style gameplay, kind of a story and I wish you will get much fun of it!</p>\r\nShort story of a game:\r\n<p>You was kidnapped by cultists of unknown clan in another dimension. You need to get out of their spooky temple and try to find a way back to your world. Collect any stuff you find and think what you can make with it. On your way you will find weapons too, so you will not be so helpful, but be careful, cultists are very crazy, they can kill you and sacrifise your soul to evil creature and your world will be destroyed!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD - walk<br/>E - interact<br/>G - drop<br/>Left mouse button - drag<br/>Ctrl - crouch<br/>Shift - sprint</p>\r\nSource code:\u00a0https://github.com/Ambear1337/1-week-game-challenge-survival-horrorIf you are interested in this challenge or in this game, here is my twitch where I stream every day of development: https://www.twitch.tv/ambear1337", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T19:33:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10c/10ce685484bcab2cffd0d5d74926f07b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ambear"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
