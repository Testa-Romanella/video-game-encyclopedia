And then, things went pear-shaped. Since his balance was more than a little im-pear-ed, the poor guy fell right onto a knife, slicing himself in two!\u00a0The pear, feeling a little sorry for himself after such a blunder, decided it was best to cut his losses and call it a night. The next morning, he woke up to find himself in a strange, dark forest.\u00a0And, to make matters worse, the pear noticed that his other part\u2026 WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!</p>\n<p>Now, the pear needs to traverse the dark, scary woods in order to find his missing piece. The forest is really dark, so he\u2019ll need to use a lantern to get the job done. Watch out for pear traps!</p><p>If the cutscene doesn't play in-game, simply download it below or watch here.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Naomi Hinchen - production, code<br/>Chaima Jemmali - code, design<br/>Maxwell Dotts - music<br/>Jermaine Leslie - art, animation<br/>Adam Greis - sound design, voice acting<br/>Chris Heins - sound design<br/>S.
