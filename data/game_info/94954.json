Here you are invited to grow a garden by opening your mind, losing yourself in exploration of a virtual world. </p><p>The purpose of this project was to explore the idea of games as a relaxation tool though player presence and FX art. Presence is the idea that a virtual environment becomes the dominant reality for the user exploring it. This prototype was created as my honours project at Abertay University. </p><p>This is a very early prototype, which will be updated frequently during April/May 2015. Bugs/crashes are pretty likely at this stage, so don't hesitate to contact me if you find some! </p><p>Mac demo will be available May 2015.</p><p>Contact Me: amystevens1@btinternet.com, @AmesyFlo, amyflorence.co.uk</p><p>Music and Sound Design by Doug Waters: https://soundcloud.com/dwmusicproductions</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a02fa99e67b463f7eb8ca4768079339.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 489, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AmesyFlo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
