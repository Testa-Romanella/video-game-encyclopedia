Collect the gems in the forest that lead the way to your dog while avoiding the demons that live in the forest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The demons can be driven back by fire, so make fire pits to keep them away. You'll need wood, stone, and flint to do that though, so be sure to find the axe, pickaxe, and shovel to gather your resources. You can upgrade your tools as time goes on to gather resources faster.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T04:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b87826872d15e20cd09cc43bfb997f9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlockGaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
