Lead your dwarves, help them to reach treasures. Choose their tiers, use magic and upgrade global skills.<br/><br/><strong>CLASSIC BATTLE MECHANICS</strong><br/>Fight with hordes of enemies in the spirit of old computer strategies and favorite flash defense games.<br/><br/><strong>ACTIVE BACKGROUND</strong><br/>Each location has its own mechanic. Brave amazons hide in the forest, the leader of the wolf pack is seated on the rocky ledge. Use all possible resources.<br/><br/><strong>FLEXIBLE UPGRADE WARRIROS IN BATTLE</strong><br/>Pump your dwarves as you like. Adjust to the incoming wave of enemies. Do you want dwarf thief? Do you want a master of swords with crit hits? Or maybe a golem summoner? No problem!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>GUILDS</strong><br/>In guilds, you can receive special assignments with new mechanics. Do you want to lead the orcs? Or become a magister of magic? Well, or to rob caravans?<br/><br/><br/><strong>System of global skills</strong><br/>In addition to dwarf upgrades in the locations, you have various permanent skills.<br/>To open them you will have to prove worthy in battles. And for the most interesting will have to sweat in guilds. Calling meteor showers or being a berserker is not easy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>NEW APPROACH TO BATTLES</strong><br/>Unlike similar games, where the whole battle is focused at one point of the screen, I introduced a system to block the movement of the soldiers. A dwarf with a goblin is fighting 1 to 1. A dwarf with a huge 5 to 1. If the dwarves or enemies are too many, they go ahead to defeat the base sooner.<br/><br/><strong>FLEXIBLE COMPLEXITY SYSTEM</strong><br/>Think tactics, calculate every action or relax and pile on the enemy, choose only you.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T03:12:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab6811406469f02d18dee3a8061d0486.jpg", "website": "https://defentres.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 330, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PinkHead Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PinkHead Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
