You aim, shoot &amp; bounce your way into the outer layer of the atmosphere using just your mouse. Can you make it to the top?<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game uses two different views. The eagle-view &amp; the side view. <br/>The eagle view is used for observing &amp; navigating through the environment.<br/>The side views are primarily used for shooting the ball. Use the mouse to aim &amp; shoot towards your destination.<br/>Visit the yellow tiles to save your progress (until you exit the game).<br/>If this is your first time playing, watching the tutorial video on the main menu is highly recommended.<br/><br/><ul><li> Single player.<br/></li><li> Music by Avaren.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/999/999558a11ea735fde518d7d5af287fa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Velikan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Velikan"], "esrb_rating": null}
