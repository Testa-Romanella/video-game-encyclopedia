{"id": 876436, "slug": "cozy-corner", "name": "Cozy Corner", "name_original": "Cozy Corner", "description": "Cozy Corner is a calming game that is meant to help you get started with your tasks and bring you into the flow state. It also gives you a cozy place to rest and be productive without any distractions. With no actual gameplay involved, Cozy Corner asks players to work on a task of their own choosing (be it studying, getting some work done, or chores) and sets a timer for said task. As a background, a different range of Lo-Fi music plays while the users work on their tasks. Cozy Corner will have three options for the time management methods: the Pomodoro technique, the 52/17 Rule, and a custom timer of the user's own choice.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T02:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5aa6458e7475cd441e31f29c2d24f35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bach"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Bach"], "esrb_rating": null}
