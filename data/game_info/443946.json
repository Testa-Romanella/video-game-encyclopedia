{"id": 443946, "slug": "caelans-adventure", "name": "Caelan's Adventure", "name_original": "Caelan's Adventure", "description": "<p>Caelan\u2019s Adventure is a game I made for my friend Caelan. He asked me to make him a game after he found out I could make games. He is very excited about the game and even told his friends about it. Caelan is 9 years old and he\u00a0really likes to play games but he finds some things challenging. He has a hard time doing multiple things at once, which makes playing games very hard. For example, in order to jump across a pit, you have to press the jump key and a directional key. In my game, I made it so that pressing the jump key makes you jump and move in the direction you\u2019re facing. Another thing Caelan has challenges with is academic learning, such as reading, writing, and math. In my game, there are \u201cEvil Rooms\u201d where Caelan is asked to answer educational questions. In addition, all the character &amp; sign dialog is read out loud as well as shown with text.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T06:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e8/9e8fada171ce1fc6aee7b8efb0270644.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Benjamin Halko"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
