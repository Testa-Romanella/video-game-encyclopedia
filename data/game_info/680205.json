With over <strong>57 different Ecolabels</strong> used in Australia including international rankings and ratings according to different criteria, it is easy to see how we all get caught\u00a0 up in 'Green-washing' and confused over the true impact of our consumer choices...But who has time to research this stuff in the middle of the supermarket? Our lives are all busy and it is far too easy to get stuck down the rabbit hole that is the internet.<br/></p>\n<p>This game has been created exactly to solve this problem! 'Eco-nomy' cuts through all the media hype and organisational 'red-tape' to ensure that your consumer rights are returned. You deserve to be able to make purchasing decisions that reflect your own values and morals and not simply rely on a company's assurance!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T03:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f63/f631a9be15d2f01d5163331636901526.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vegemiteisastaplediet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
