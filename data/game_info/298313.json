It\u2019s a pretty easy task but soon you\u2019ll realize that there\u2019s more to the temple and that something\u2019s going on.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>It is said that an ancient monster was unleashed centuries ago and that it brought destruction to the area. The temple was rebuilt on top of the ruins and no one knows what happened to the monster. This is just a legend, but the monks seem to be really obsessed with it. Solve music-related puzzles, work your way in the depths of the temple and discover the truth. Some monks will help you, others will ask you to help them. Some will try to prevent you from discovering too much and, finally, some will just have wise words for you, everyone knows about their wisdom after all.</p>\n<p>Video game developed for the Videogame Design and Programming course, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/polimigamecollective<br/>https://twitter.com/polimigc<br/>http://www.polimigamecollective.org<br/>http://polimi-game-collective.itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T06:04:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/184/184164943934f8a80e7940b73edf8cbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
