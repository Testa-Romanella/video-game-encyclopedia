Try to get Steve to follow his to-do list for the day! Don't be fooled by his adorable appearance, this will not be an easy task.\u00a0</p>\r\nConcept\r\n<p>This is an individual game sketch based on personal life experiences. Conscience vs. Steve suggests that we all know the difference between\u00a0right and wrong, but in reality, it's never that simple. We go back and forth between what we \"should\" do and what we truly \"desire\" in the moment. Instantaneous reward is satisfying for a minute, but long-term reward is usually more meaningful. How we navigate between the two is dependent on our daily life choices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve resembles our desires, and you the player resemble morality. Do you surrender to instantaneous pleasure? Or are you a planner? Do you procrastinate and give up on yourself, or do you face your fears and risk failure?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T05:53:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/66568d08642630c32a2bcc2f9349edb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LynnAlkhouri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
