The last months of Summer have been beautiful and vivid and fleeting but perhaps it\u2019s time for the dream to end. After registering\u00a0the club officially, you\u2019re tasked with participating in the school\u2019s club showcase. Can your club survive the first semester? </p>\n<p>Demo Features:</p>\n<ul><li>two male romanceable love interests</li><li>two hair color choices to customize your renameable MC</li></ul>\n<p>Please be aware that this is a demo! Sprites should be fully coded in but there is no music, and testing was minimal. It's taking a while, but I hope you'll look forward to the finished release!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/240/2401b66475a670402cf65154dfa37352.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["December"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
