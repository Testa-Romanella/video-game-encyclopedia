The theme, \"out of control,\" is present in a few ways, but the most obvious is that\u00a0your bullets ricochet off walls and other bullets in random directions. Additionally, while your bullet is active you can no longer use that ability - you have literally \"lost a control.\"</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Everything in the game was made by myself except for the font, sound, and music assets, (which have been credited in-game).</p>\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n<p>The game runs at 1200x720 on WebGL. and 1920x1080 on windows.\u00a0Requires a mouse and keyboard.<br/><br/>Please let me know if you have any issues downloading the windows build / running either version of the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:39:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb6/cb67841141da1a48efad4bf0a104f5eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ldonelan98"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
