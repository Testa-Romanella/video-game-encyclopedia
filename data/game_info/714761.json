You control them all and need to survive the longer you can. Don't forget that everything has consequences especially when we're talking about Time.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is awful with bad content because we weren't inspired at all by the theme which was : \"3 ghosts (Past, Present and Future)\" so after an hour of struggling for ideas we decided to give up and create a totally awful game and here it is !! Yay ! Play it please... Please *sad face*. Oh and Use arrow Keys to move ^^<br/><br/>All this game is ironical of course, don't report us it's actually a not so bad game but it's neither good. Im sorry to everybody who has played this.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T04:43:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1a/d1a3fcda14df9c4e8defd77b9e69c632.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yolwoocle", "PouletRaPHOO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
