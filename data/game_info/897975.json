Faced with this crisis, the company Eco-Power has enlisted the help of the racoon Roger. With his trash powered jetpack and trusty vacuum, he intends to clean up the city, one piece of trash at a time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Inspired by the prompts of Future Mobility, you control Roger as he flies around the city with his jetpack, sucking up all the trash with his vacuum before shooting out what he\u2019s collected for it to be recycled into energy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Created over the course of two weeks for the first game project by several FutureGames\u2019 students, this game was made with a younger audience of around 10 years old in mind, but there\u2019s nothing stopping veteran gamers from enjoying it as well! During our work we quickly found what worked and what didn\u2019t in terms of keeping the player engaged, and we have made something we think people of all ages can enjoy. Take to the streets and give it your all, for a cleaner tomorrow!\u00a0</p>\n<p>We would like to thank Tekniska Museet and Microsoft for this wonderful learning opportunity to create games for gamers with disabilities</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T15:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a1c8c4c48e4ca27676e69850050fa8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
