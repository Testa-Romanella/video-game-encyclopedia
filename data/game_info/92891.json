It is more like a platformer in which you never let go of the right button.<br/></p>\n<p>You only need two buttons, but their usage frequently changes depending on the special abilities that you currently have. Sometimes you can blink short distances, flip gravity or even break the space time continuum.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game is in an early stage - there are no sound effects, music, and the levels past the first one look very bland at the moment.</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>:\r\n<ul><li>Button 1: Left half of the screen.
