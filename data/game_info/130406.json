You take the role of a lonely Meteor on a trip down the trans-galactic highway of death. Your only company on this journey is whatever mass you can pick up along the way. Navigate your way in an ever expanding universe through various hazards, power- ups, and targets as you accumulate mass like a gym rat during bulk season.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Starstruck is a 3D, 3rd person game developed in Unity by Meteor Men. It is an endless runner set in space with the primary goal being to gain mass in relation to the target ahead of you. Doing so allows your collision with the target to succeed and for you to progress to the next target. There are plenty of hazards to challenge you along the way. Power Ups dispersed through the map will help you get further in the game, and achieve a higher score. Post your high score and try and make the top spot!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6c/f6cf6ac87c49d7152500e3de124fa497.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dselvia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
