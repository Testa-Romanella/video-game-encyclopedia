Your parents have been killed by an evil wizard, who now realized all too late that they've left the protagonist alive. And, as any great villain would, they take their sweet time coming after you. A single mysterious old man warns you, that it is dangerous to go alone, and teaches you set up some basic defenses. Now the whole world is after you - the dead, the living, the nightmares and even tanks. Can you survive in the hellscape that is your crumbling homeland using nothing more than towers you create from scrap the old man finds lying around? <br/></p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>A unique take on the tower defense genre - instead of purchasing towers you loot their parts and assemble them together in any way you please. A tower made out of wood shooting from a mounted flamethower? A tower which is just a four way sniper rifle mounted atop a pile of gold with Midas in a crystal nearby? An insane marvel of extradimensional technology, guided by a self-aware AI core, with bullets pulled into the present from the future, while all of this being mounted atop a marble column? We got it all! Your imagination \u00a0is your limit!</li><li>Discover various unique tower part combination - the system is flexible and allows many strategies. Deadly up close, taking enemies from afar or maybe melting them down with lazers - it is your choice, and your luck.</li><li>Currently 35 waves implemented with various enemy compositions and 5 bosses to fight.</li><li>20 types of enemies with various abilities, effects, and different approaches required to beat them. Killing a ghost is different from killing a crab, though both are achieved similarly.</li><li>Randomly generated loot! You are rewarded for completing waves by chests, which contain randomly generated loot. Don't feel lucky? You can always sacrifice the loot to Nyarlathotep in the hopes of getting something extremely great later.</li><li>Enemy effect system - if you want better loot you can agree for a certain batch of effects being granted to enemies in the next wave. You know the effects beforehand and you can choose whether to enable them or not. The choice is yours...</li><li>Various unique components with special abilities. Super-rare components that make everything else <em>pale </em>in comparison. Want a gun that can shoot time? A tower core that pulls bullets out of thin air? Or maybe you want to infect your enemies with xenomorph larvae and see them slowly be devoured from the inside? That and much more is left for you to discover.</li><li>A bestiary that contains a different outlook on the enemies you've killed so far, and the detailed information about them.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Control time flow with <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong> keys.</p>\n<p>Spacebar to pause time.</p>\n<p>Enter to accept effects before the wave.</p>\n<p>Right-click to either sacrifice(a chest) or destroy(a tower)</p>\n<p>Left click to pick stuff up and drop it down.</p>\n<p>Backspace to skip pre-turn time.</p>\n<p>Move your cursor close to the edges of the screen to move the camera, or use the middle mouse button.</p>\n<p>Scrollwheel to zoom in and out.</p>\n\n<p>Extras</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Miz Jam 1. https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1. This was also my first game to be made for a game jam, and my first game to be completed in general.</p>\n<p>This game was made using the 1-bit asset pack only. https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack.</p>\n<p>This game was built with the Godot Game Engine. https://godotengine.org. This was also my first experience with Godot.</p>\n<p>A video link to the devlog of this game will be available in the future.</p>\n<p>A github link to the project sources will be available in the future. Keep in mind that the code is rather horrible because of the time constraints of the challenge.<br/>A\u00a0github\u00a0link\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0source\u00a0code\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0game is\u00a0now\u00a0available.</p><p>https://github.com/skyloutyr/SkyTD</p>\n<p>I can't test the Linux build of the game as I don't have a Linux machine and a VM might not represent the consumer's device well enough. Use at your own risk.</p>\n<p>The executable is actually named JamTD as I always fail to come up with creative project names. You can even see for yourself that the final name is not much different. You have probably downloaded the correct game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time. I hope you have fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:50:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d53/d53b6dc9f6e8965fd0f77a976462a6c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["skyloutyr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
