Please listen to us again. What kind of game is this: absolutely pure original playing styles, including card strategy battle, adventure, tower defense, puzzle solving and card development. You can't use any game model to compare with our game. But we can guarantee that although this product has many integrated elements, it has high playability. If you want to find a completely different game experience, it is really worth trying.<br/><br/>I. [Rich levels]<br/>The story takes place in a cat country full of magical power. At present, it has more than 100 levels. Each well-designed level is guiding players to better learn the string killing strategy. The early strategy is simple. The more comprehensive strategies need to be used in the future, and sometimes it is normal to be stuck for a few days.<br/><br/>II [Hotpot invade]<br/>To get more and better cards, you need to fight with players of the same class. This is the core of the game. The current combat mode is the offline mode. More than 600 PVP battlefields are designed for players to challenge. This is the place with the largest game output and the richest card resources. Only by making perfect use of various card matching strategies can players win, or even spend several days.<br/><br/>III [Guild adventure]<br/>Players can join the guild. Guild members can chat, exchange cards, and support each other in guild tasks to get guild rewards as soon as possible.<br/><br/>IV [Card system]<br/>The game currently has more than 80 independent cards for players to choose from. Cards are gradually unlocked with the improvement of the player's strength. Each card has random attributes, that is, cards that do not necessarily look bad must be difficult to use. There are often surprises when a good attribute is randomly selected to cooperate with other cards.<br/><br/>V [Combat System]<br/>Turn based combat plus step control.<br/>The turn based combat model is not much different from the traditional one. The step control allows players to operate multiple times in the same round, which is the biggest difference from the traditional one, but the step should also be used carefully. The fighting principle is that players need to collected the corresponding food in series to provide energy for cards. Each card needs different type of energy. You can use card skill when energy is enough.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T18:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ab/7abe4fe48ab8eb926aa1f2e6bebda87c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5e7f\u5dde\u65b0\u6e38\u661f\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5e7f\u5dde\u65b0\u6e38\u661f\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "esrb_rating": null}
