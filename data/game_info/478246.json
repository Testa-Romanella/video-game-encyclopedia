It seems nobody has ever been there, it was untouched by humanity. You were eager to explore it, and upon doing so you found the most unbelievable sight...An ancient alien shipwreck! You carefully make your way into the weathering spacecraft. There were no signs of life, but you felt a chill, a presence...</p>\n<p>You quickly gathered some of the technology that was immediately around you and left.</p>\n<p>After a long trek back you took the samples into your personal lab to study them. They seemed to draw power from another dimension. After months of research and development, you use the technology of your time and your intellect to create a device that can rewind moments of time. You hoped to create a more sophisticated device; but realize you need more material to do so. Your thirst for knowledge and innovation led you back to the area where you originally found the shipwreck, although this time, something seemed different\u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>A &gt;&gt; Move Left</p>\n<p>D &gt;&gt; Move Right</p>\n<p>W / Space &gt;&gt; Jump</p>\n<p>TAB\u00a0 &gt;&gt; Menu / Descriptions</p>\n<p>F1 &gt;&gt; Exit Full Screen</p>\n<p>Enter &gt;&gt; Restart</p>\n<p>Backspace &gt;&gt; Quit</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONCEPT</strong></p>\n<p>This is a submission for the Brackey's 2020.2 Game Jam!\u00a0For the theme \"rewind\" I\u00a0decided to make a\u00a02D-platformer where you can rewind the game, and create a move set / upgrades based around that alone. Instead of giving the player different weapons and a suite of moves, I just gave the player basic movement, a swing/slash attack, and the ability to travel backwards in time by a limited amount. At first the moves may not seem like a lot, but the time travel offers a lot of versatility, and I\u00a0feel like we barely got to explore it. Let me know what you think in the comments and what can be improved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:16:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfd/cfd74399ea617545350fc345e4d5e23c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CURLEE", "Jenidiah"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
