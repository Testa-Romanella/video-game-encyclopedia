When you deal damage to an enemy you accumulate potential damage points which can then be multiplied by rolling yourself, the face that lands up is the multiplier. For example: you hit an enemy 5 times, then you roll yourself and land a 4, so you do 5x4=20 damage if you had rolled a six it would be 5x6=30 damage. The orange part of the enemy health bar is the maximum potential damage you can do in a roll(rolling a 6).</p>\n<p>By the way: you can can sprint by holding shift, forgot to include that prompt in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy my little game.</p>\n<p>I intend to flesh out the concept and build a real game from this.</p>\n<p>So coming to Steam real soon.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing. :)</p>\n\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/H9GszBYraC</p>\n<p>Social: https://linktr.ee/dopeloopgames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T18:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32e/32e3dc7bc440868929129de277605de3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dope Loop Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
