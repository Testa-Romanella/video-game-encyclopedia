Since it's a casual game jam I thought I would creatively stretch the rules a bit. In this game you are an astronaut who's oxygen tank is broken and your losing oxygen fast, you only have 20 seconds to live! luckily you have a time travel button that sends you and only you back in time, allowing you to affect the environment and then go back in time without anything changing. (Similar to Braid) The song used is one I made a long time ago\u00a0called oxygen I chose it because of the fitting name.\u00a0Has a few small bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T14:57:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/855/8557b84427a82a13b1e5da98f817eb27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarioMan98"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
