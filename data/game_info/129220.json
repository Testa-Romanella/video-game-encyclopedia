I'll respond to a couple comments. Updates are coming for things like spawning into a tree or rock. Until then it's HARDCORE MODE. Also, you can't slap anything until you've got your stick! There's a SINGLE stick in each world, keep looking or (R)estart!</p>\n\n<p>Made in 48 hours for the Butterscotch Shenanijam, Single Stick Slapper is a game about surviving the stone age with nothing but your trusty whacking stick!</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move, and R to reroll the level. Survive as long as possible for the high score!</p>\n<p>Gameplay Trailer:\u00a0<br/></p><p>The song is \"Miniboss Fight [loop]\" by Visager, cc-by.
