You play as a retired milkman who has the power to rotate the world around him. This power is cool but not as cool as our milkman's past. You once where the number one interplanetary milkman who had received many a prestigious award through the years. You get roped into one final milkrun in order to keep the Milky Way as we know it, safe. Each\u00a0planet you visit will provide you with new challenges and unique visual styles to immerse yourself in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Command your own ship and choose which planet you wish to deliver the goods to. Completion of a milk run rewards you with upgrades to your ship. This includes the development of different sections to the ship which shall provide appealing visual aids on how well you are progressing through the game. Creating the ultimate milk delivery machine while saving the Milky Way is the dream.</p>\n<p>QuajournioN is a game which doesn't take itself seriously. It aims to provide humour and interesting gameplay experiences on a regular basis. The game is still in a very early development stage but over the coming months I aim to gain\u00a0progress very well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Already I have received quite a lot of feedback and understand that the initial development is of course not perfect but with your help maybe it can benefit greatly.\u00a0Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>O/P = Rotate</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys / WASD = Movement</p>\n<p>E = Interact</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905b14d5a1f43642f1e685242feb4849.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jamalamalamajam"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
