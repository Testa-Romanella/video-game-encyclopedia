{"id": 102571, "slug": "gridfighter-3d", "name": "Gridfighter 3D", "name_original": "Gridfighter 3D", "description": "<p>You are triangle. Shoot squares.\u00a0Get points.<br/><br/>Gridfighter 3D\u00a0is a classic '80s-style arcade shooter for your Forte VFX1, Oculus Rift DK1, or other VR headset that does side-by-side rendering. Gameplay is reminiscent of Tempest, Galaga, or even Arkanoid\u00a0with the added challenge of the third dimension. Enemies will aggressively follow you around the map in 3D and you must get in front or behind them to blast them - and you're gonna want to hit as many as you can with the same shot for big multipliers.<br/></p>\n<p>Features surreal 4-bit neon colors, a full 3D playfield &amp; properly-arcade square-wave music &amp; sound effects.</p>\n<p>Runs on 386 or better PCs with any version of DOS. Pentium or K6 recommended. Supports DOSBox on both x86 and Android platforms!\u00a0(Fast, relatively-modern CPU needed for emulation.)<br/></p>\n<p>Trivia: Gridfighter 3D may be the first complete DOS game to support the Oculus Rift. It's almost certainly the first one to support both the Rift and the Forte\u00a0VFX1. More headsets will be added when I\u00a0get my hands on them for testing &amp; geometry setup.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c73ffe4f2b0cba4ff6cf1e5842232ffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["porta2note"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
