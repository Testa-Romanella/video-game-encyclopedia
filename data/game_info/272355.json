Additionally, having only a Macbook meant the only way I could upload all the files was to make it an zip file.\u00a0Apologies for that.). \u00a0:(</p><p>Side Note:\u00a0When extracting the zip. file, if asked to extract the Background Music credits, skip it. That is the only item that doesn't need extracting.</p>\n<p>PS: I highly doubt I will come back to work on this game again. It was a good practice and experimental trial that gave me lots of experience, but this is only made for the event. Now,I'm going to work on the final, full version of this game! :D In the meantime, if you did play the game, tell me what you think about it. Did you enjoy it? Is there anything that I can improve?
