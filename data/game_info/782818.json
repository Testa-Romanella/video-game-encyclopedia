Eventhough the jam lasted 48 hours, I only worked on the project for about 24 hours due to school. I wrote all the code myself (with help of Brackeys, of course :)) and made the music on my\u00a0own. I decided to use some of my assets, which I bought some time ago and they worked out great (models not made by me)!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing and don't encounter many bugs, because my playtesting was very short :^)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T08:45:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/679/679bfca65948a9969a318f2d056e6be3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SimplyDev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
