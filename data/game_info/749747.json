You play as Steppy the Mouse who is trying to acquire a cheese platter as a\u00a0wedding anniversary gift for their significant other. Without the necessary funds, you must travel\u00a0to work everyday, collecting coins and purchasing upgrades along the way with the hopes of\u00a0making enough money before the anniversary date. Will you be able to make enough money in\u00a0the 5 days leading up to the special day, or will you run out of time?</p>\n<p>Cheese The Day was created by 12 students at Futuregames. The game was made over the\u00a0course of 4 weeks and was created using Unity. Each of the teams during this project were\u00a0assigned a theme, with ours being commuting. Inspired by games similar to Mario Odyssey, we\u00a0wanted to create a fun, semi open-world, and challenging platformer where balancing either\u00a0saving up money for cheeses or spending money on upgrades was always on the player\u2019s mind\u00a0and crucial to success.</p>\n<p>The game was created with a younger audience in mind, while still wanting the game to be\u00a0enjoyable to audiences outside of it as well. We hope you enjoy playing Cheese The Day!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T09:27:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/404/4040d838388d36976fe39019a17dad53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
