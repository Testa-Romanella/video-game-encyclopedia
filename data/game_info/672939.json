Then it becomes unstable with each of the three points having a chance to fall down.\u00a0 Also there are 4 balls on the board, which you control one at a time and randomly get switched.\u00a0 The current ball you're moving will be a Yellow Color.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 4 scoring points on the board (squares and hemi-spheres) passing a scoring ball though a scoring point scores you points. But a Non Scoring ball passing through the point takes away some points.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Player Movement is with WASD or Arrow keys.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T05:49:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7d/b7d953d562b42e7b856215e75a2df8d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaleva_Poincare"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
