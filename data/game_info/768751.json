Look no further!</p>\n<p>Presenting you with \"Count the Cars\", a basic clicker game where you have to count the cars... But clicking on them.</p>\n<p>How far did you get?</p>\n\n<p>OK, about the development behind this. I saw the froggie kit on craftpix.net and have been wanting to do something with it for a while, and then the clicker jam poped up and I was \"oh I have a few hours\".</p>\n<p>It was fun to waste abit of time developing this, and I would have love to make more advancements on this little game.</p>\n<p>Few things, i'd add? More cars, background animations, sounds, music, more conditions....</p>\n<p>In actual fact, I was wasting 2 days just trying to come up with an idea, that required more than just \"clicking\".... Obviously I failed...\u00a0None the less... Here we all...</p>\n\n<p>All in all? In a few days I will look back on this, and think\u00a0\"a few hours well wasted...\" lol\u00a0:P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T08:50:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/650/65073171e4ea4f63ab9027c563918465.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ScienceJ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
