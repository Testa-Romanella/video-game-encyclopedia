GridWars is always fun because you can play against real people.<br/><br/>Select from four unit types: Tank, Helicopter, Anti-Air or Bomb<br/><br/>Units gain experience through kills and can become veterans.  Veteran units are a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>GridWars&amp;#39; retro graphics pay homage to Tron. If you like the style of Geometry Wars, you&amp;#39;ll love GridWars.<br/><br/>You can play in either single player or two players mode.<br/><br/>We&amp;#39;ve spent as much time balancing GridWars as we have developing it.  Just like StarCraft and WarCraft, units are all unique and well balanced.<br/><br/>-------<br/>Credits<br/>-------<br/><br/>Development by Steve Dekorte and Rich Collins<br/><br/>Artwork by Sara Gross (twobitart.carbonmade.com)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cca180880a5f70792abf27efd4ccbb4.jpeg", "website": "http://dekorte.com/projects/iphone/gridwars/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Steve Dekorte"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Stephen Dekorte"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
