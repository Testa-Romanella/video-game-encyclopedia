V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, the uncontested main character of the Finnish national epic Kalevala, rests his weary legs on a stump and takes out his kantele to play a few notes. Much to his surprise, he garners quite the crowd. In Kantelemania, you help V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen play the kantele to keep his audience hyped up. Miss too many notes and V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen will face public humiliation. Let's not let it get to that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T10:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffe/ffeddde63815d05590cc3741779e636c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
