These sections is littered with enemies you have to take out to proceed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who is the enemy?</p>\n<p>Society of Zero, as they like to call themselves, was a seemingly friendly alien race, that wanted to help humanity. However,\u00a0Society of Zero thought humans had a secret to life. Something unique they haven't seen before and they wanted to get that for themselves.
