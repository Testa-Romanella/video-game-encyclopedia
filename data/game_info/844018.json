Too weak to take care of itself, it sends forth one single, tiny slime. This slime is you.<br/></p>\n<p>Provided with the mother slimes' core, you need to take care of your mother. Serve her various savory resources to help her recover. But look out - she will get weaker as time continues, so make sure a constant supply of nutriment is established!</p>\n<p>Luckily, you don't have to shoulder this burden alone - by using the powers of the mother slime core, you are able to generate duplicates of yourself for chopping down trees, picking reed for fibers and many other tasks that help to ensure survival of Mother Slime!</p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for? Get out there, explore, harvest, mine - and, most importantly, make Mom proud!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Feature list</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fits the GameJam theme (\"Evolve!\") due to having a tiny slime splitting up into more and more slimes. Becoming a horde - one slime at a time evolving into a slimy, but productive and hungry-for-resources workforce!</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Simple, but (hopefully) satisfying game loop - \"Watch the numbers grow!\"</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Unlock more resources and regions while you progress through the game!</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Slimes, of course (because who doesn't like those tiny blobs of big-eyed cuteness?)!</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Cute background story which doesn't get in the way of the gameplay!</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Controls &amp; supported input devices</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Input devices: PC keyboard, Gamepad</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Controls for PC keyboard:</li></ul>\r\nPause the game<br/>ESCMove upW / \u2191<br/>Move leftA / \u2190<br/>Move down<br/>S / \u2193<br/>Move right<br/>D / \u2192<br/>InteractE<br/>\n<ul><li>Controls for Gamepad:</li></ul>\r\nPause the game<br/>START button<br/>Move up<br/>Left Stick - Up<br/>Move left<br/>Left Stick - Left<br/>Move down<br/>Left Stick - Down<br/>Move right<br/>Left Stick - Right<br/>InteractSouth Button<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Tutorial</strong></p>\n<p>Move around the environment using the movement controls mentioned above. If near to a resource like resin or an essence, use the \"Interact\" key to pick it up.</p>\n<p>When you're near a resource POI (like a sawmill, a reed pond, a quarry or an iron mine), you can deploy tiny slimes to work there by using the \"Interact\" key. Those slimes will generate the assigned resource over time.</p>\n<p>When near to Mother Slime, use the \"Interact\" key to feed her. This will increase her HP, preventing a game over.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Minimum / recommended system specifications</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Minimum specs: <em>untested</em></li></ul>\n<ul><li> Recommended specs: <em>untested</em></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Use of external assets &amp; tools<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Tools:<ul><li>Unity Engine (game engine)</li><li>Blender (3D asset creation)</li><li>Substance Painter 3D (normal map generation)</li><li>Audacity (audio editing)</li><li>Google Translate (for writing this Itch.io page)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Sounds<ul><li>\"Button select\" sound: mixkit.co<br/></li><li>\"Menu Selection\" sound: opengameart.org</li></ul><ul><li>\"Low Slime HP\" sound: mixkit.co</li></ul><ul><li>\"Chirping Birds\" sound: mixkit.co</li></ul><ul><li>\"Building\" sound: youtube.com</li></ul><ul><li>\"Walking on grass\" sound: bigsoundbank.com</li></ul><ul><li>\"Cutting\" sound: pixabay.com</li></ul><ul><li>\"Mining\" sound: pixabay.com</li></ul><ul><li>\"Plop\" sound:\u00a0youtube.com<br/></li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><em>Note: You can use the links below to get forwarded onto the matching entry for the respective sound on the cited website - or at least as close as it gets.
