But as you make the first move, \"What???\" - the whole labyrinth rebuilds, you have to look for a new way through. After each move you can surprisingly find yourself in a dead end and have to go back, or in an open room able to move anywhere, but you never know how it will rebuild next time, so just make your guess... <br/>\r\nThe goal is to collect blue cubes within minimum moves possible, but also don't ignore the bonuses - they may be very useful. Sometimes it seems that the game is just screwing with you - but it can't, walls move in an absolutely random way (excluding only the possibility to lock player in one cell). However that doesn't mean there is absolutely no strategy, you'll figure it out while playing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:44:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0b/a0b52ad8a466d8e6808fff7668282f7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u0417\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440/\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439", "Sergey Melnikov"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u0417\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440/\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439", "Sergey Melnikov"], "esrb_rating": null}
