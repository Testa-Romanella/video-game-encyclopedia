The dice will follow Pip's actions on its own grid, and its rolls can be used to unlock doors for Pip to go through!</p>\n<p><strong>Other info</strong></p>\n<p>Adjust music volume (or turn it off) via the Options menu</p>\n<p>The dice in the top-right is an accurate d6, and will track your motion unless it is blocked. The lines on the background behind Pip correspond to the cells the dice rolls around in.</p><p><strong>Hint</strong><br/></p><p>If there isn't a square of four empty tiles\u00a0for the dice to roll around in, then it will always have the same number facing up whenever it's in that position. So sometimes you can solve the puzzle by only thinking about where you need the dice to be to get the number you need.
