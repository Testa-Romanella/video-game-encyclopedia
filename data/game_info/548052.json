Select, rotate, move, and combine blocks to create new paths for Max. Together you must retrieve the missing energy orbs and restore the colors of the rainbow. <br/><br/>Even though Marbleous Blocks was designed to be a single player game there is still plenty of room for collaboration. The core of the game is about trying out different strategies and while you try one strategy your coplayer may think of a different one or complement yours. <br/><br/>The game consists of 45 puzzles of varying difficulty. Will you be able to solve them all?<br/><br/><strong>Create paths</strong><br/>Move and rotate blocks (tetrominoes + friends) to create paths for Max. Creating paths requires energy cubes so you need to plan the paths, so you do not run out of energy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Switch armors</strong><br/>Max may wear different armors, each with its own set of abilities. Switch between armors to gain access to different parts of the world. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Explore</strong><br/>Planning is key, but since you may instantly undo your actions, exploration is encouraged and is an important aspect of the game play.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T02:38:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d75e2e8c5153f186c99f9c1ba0b3b97b.jpg", "website": "http://pixleon.com/project/marbleous-blocks/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixleon"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixleon"], "esrb_rating": null}
