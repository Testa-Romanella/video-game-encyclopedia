Release thrust and your ship will coast to a stop.<br/>When the ship is flashing at the start of levels and after being\u00a0<br/>destroyed, you are invulnerable (though only for 2-3 seconds!).<br/>Bonus ship every 25,000 points (max of 9 ships at a time).</p>\n<p>SHIELDS\u00a0<br/>Can only be on for up to 2 seconds at a time, and need an equal time off<br/>to \"recharge\". Keep them up for longer than 2 seconds and your ship explodes!<br/>While up, nothing can harm you, except the mighty Superbomb.</p>\n<p>FIRE</p>\n<p>Unlimited. Fire away!</p>\n<p>SUPERBOMBS</p>\n<p>When released, they glide slowly in a straight line, and detonate when they<br/>run into something or after a short interval. The explosion is a spreading<br/>fireball, incinerating everthing it consumes, including you if you're not<br/>fast enough (even with your shields up!). Extra superbomb every 30,000 pts.<br/>Asteroids and enemies destroyed by the superbomb will give you TRIPLE points!</p>\n<p>ENEMIES</p>\n<p>ASTEROIDS<br/>They're just rocks, but can pulverize you. They drift and tumble through<br/>space mindlessly and come in three sizes. Large rocks split into 2 medium<br/>rocks, and medium rocks into 2 small rocks.<br/>Large and medium rocks may take more than one hit to break up!</p>\n<p>SAUCERS<br/>Come in large and small sizes, and track you relentlessly. The large saucer<br/>is slow, but shoots fast and takes multiple hits to destroy. The small<br/>saucer is quick, but shoots less and takes only a few hits. They first appear<br/>at level 3.</p>\n<p>SEEKERS<br/>Are guided missiles which home in on your ship. Shields will protect you.<br/>Shoot them before they reach you (one hit destroys them). They make their<br/>debut at level 5.</p>\n<p>SCORING</p>\n<p>Large asteroid\u00a0 - 50 pts<br/>Medium asteroid - 100 pts<br/>Small asteroid\u00a0 - 200 pts<br/>Large saucer\u00a0 \u00a0 - 2000 pts<br/>Small saucer\u00a0 \u00a0 - 1000 pts<br/>Seeker\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 1200 pts</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/393/393c7f2b2ee334bfbdf6a049d4a241ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Retroreloader @ Return learn games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
