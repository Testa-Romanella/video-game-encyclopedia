The game was tested on Windows and Linux.</em><br/></p><p>Description:<br/>==================</p><p>It is well known that humanity is multiplying like bunnies, thus we need more and more room. What to do, when we run out of space?</p><p>Gameplay:<br/>==================</p><p>In this game you have to conquer all worlds in each level. You can send out units, produced automatically in your worlds, to other connected worlds to reinforce or conquer them. The enemies all have different behaviours, so beware of their counter tactics. Have fun playing.</p><p>Technical Details:<br/>==================<br/>The game was made in Java using libGDX (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). We made all the graphics ourself with the tool PyxelEdit (http://pyxeledit.com/).  The background music was made using LMMS (https://lmms.io/). All the sound effects were created with assets of the 'The #GameAudioGDC Bundle' (Part 3) (http://www.sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc2017/).</p><p>Made by:<br/>==================<br/>Skosnowich<br/>Matjes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/329/3296d93f6fabe89165bf6a1975bddb43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Skosnowich"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
