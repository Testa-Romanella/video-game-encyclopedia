The player can push the lighthouse to illuminate other parts of the map, so as to explore different parts of the map. The goal of the game is to collect the crystals scattered all over the map. After collecting all the crystals, you can win. This is not a very easy process. It needs the players to work hard to achieve it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T03:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/708a44bf67d9205682f978f0f56fcc3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yang Sun"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yang Sun"], "esrb_rating": null}
