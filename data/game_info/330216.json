There is another game with a title similar to <strong>YABS </strong>that summarizes the idea very well... ;)</p>\n<p>Before the battle, left click to spawn troops and right click to delete them (I still have to put that instructions in-game sorry)</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that the game is very new and it doesn't have many things yet. However, I have found out that creating new units is actually very easy so expect many more of those, as well as maps and other features such as fortifications, spells, slow motion, custom units, maybe more factions... who knows.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the use of Unity's Lightweight Render Pipeline and code optimization, the game can run many AI agents without performance issues. This means you could play the game even if your computer is a\u00a0potato!</p>\n<p>Lastly, I encourage you all to\u00a0join my Discord server\u00a0if you want to give feedback or ideas or just hang out with other cool people :) Something I'd actually really appreciate and encourage is that if you have a Twitch/YT channel you could record some gameplay so that I\u00a0can post some links here. That way I can show some gameplay before people have to download the game and your channel gets more visits. The language doesn't matter and you could send me the link via Discord or itch.io comments.</p>\n<p>Anyways, what are you waiting for? Just download the game and start playing to test it yourself!\u00a0Thanks for playing and have fun!</p>\n<p>(By the way it seems like there is some UI scaling issue in Mac but nobody knows how to fix it sorry)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T05:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d53/d53e25b12d03cab0019e7a85bd5a526a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Delthor"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
