Explore large levels and engage in semi-turn-based battles as Charlene - a kid whose best friend is the giant robot Gigantimus. Charlene's quest is to get her heroes (Gigantimus's pilot, Averagmus, and resistance fighter, Singuliera) back together after a tumultuous breakup.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Game Design + Story: Ether Penguin</p>\n<p>Music: chvage</p>\n<p>Character Portrait Art: littlekittenbit and ion</p>\n<p>The game is fairly incomplete and collectibles do nothing. But it's still fun to run through the story and hang out in the locations. The current build of the game has an unfortunate screen tearing problem, I'll be looking to fix this in an update.</p>\n<p>The game supports mouse + keyboard in addition to controllers but the button prompts on screen are only for controllers. Mouse and keyboard controls are:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Mouse - Camera</p>\n<p>Space - Jump, Interact, Confirm</p>\n<p>E - Draw weapon when enemies are near, Cancel</p>\n<p>1, 2, 3, 4 - Use moves in battle</p>\n<p>Tab - Switch enemy target</p>\n<p>Version 1.1 fixes issues including health pickups not working and a cutscene being skipped. Screen tearing is still a problem.</p>\n<p>Version 1.2 is available now. This fixes a number of bugs including serious game-breaking bugs. The game is playable all the way through and the full cutscene for defeating DSD should play. There's only one bug I can't seem to fix but it's nothing serious. It's also available in full screen now. Press alt +\u00a0enter to toggle fullscreen or windowed. I'm so sorry to anyone who played the previous versions and encountered the more serious bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T14:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/702/70206d5f77431bfb00554bda135349ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EtherPenguin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
