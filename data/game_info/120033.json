If the host dies with you in it, it's game over.</p><p>The controls are bit unconventional from classic RLs, You click and hold in the game space to extend a cursor to any spot you can see. If you have a clear path to that spot, then you can move there, but it costs extra energy to do so. The twist here is that moving farther in a single turn may cost more energy, but it also builds up your strength. More strength means that your attacks will be more effective.</p><p>Keep an eye on your energy, when it gets low you will need to possess a new host.</p><p>Find the stairs to beat the level and move on to the next. My high score is 4 levels, can you beat it?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/848/84841800d6aa5e90e1de265251fc1720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Edwin DeNicholas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
