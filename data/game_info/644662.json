In the 3-minute video, the main character runs through a crumbling city, periodically fighting with unusual creatures that vaguely resemble sand monsters from The Sands of Time. The Prince&#39;s left hand seemed to be somehow connected to the sands, thanks to which the hero could rewind time and interact with the essence of enemies. Apparently, Ubisoft wanted to restart the &quot;Sands of Time&quot;.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2023-08-16T06:47:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/131c5e61df7aa209ea952203124594ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 628, "game_series_count": 13, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Montreal"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
