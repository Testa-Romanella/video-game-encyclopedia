Artifact pieces are found randomly in chests, which also provide a small health boost or random permanent bonuses to damage, health regeneration or speed. Defeat enemies to gain experience and level up to gain more maximum health. Enemies get stronger the more they spawn, so make sure to get all the experience you can get out of each one.</p><p>This is the original 72-hour version made for Ludum Dare and as such has a lot left to be desired. A post-compo version will be made eventually that should provide more of what was originally intended for the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adf/adf7471f4bd26567e0a0a1666ada115d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["LukeZaz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
