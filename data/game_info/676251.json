Be careful! If you travel along the same path too many times you will fall into the water... How many packages will you be able to deliver before getting soaked?!</p>\n<p><strong>reminder:\u00a0EXPERIENCED BEST IN\u00a0DESKTOP (the HTML browser version is like sludge)</strong></p>\n<p>This is my first entry in any Game Jam. I have a limited understanding of coding but I\u00a0am a challenge producer by trade. It was fun to take part in such a taxing event. It's shocking how long things can take to do. \u00a0</p>\n<p>If anyone pops the hood on this baby\u00a0\u00a0they will smell some STANKY code. I'm pretty sure this game runs 50k collision checks per minute because I\u00a0couldn't get my 1 player check to work... so instead I\u00a0had each individual object do the check rather than the player. For this reason the desktop version of this game plays better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy and can get a better score than me, 17!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T12:27:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1a/d1ae5127ef3547521888c734bfb6defa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["financialdiet"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
