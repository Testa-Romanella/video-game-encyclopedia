(Also note that the screenie is from slightly earlier in development!)</em></p><p>Get the train moving, but at what cost?</p>\n<p>Made for LDJam#43, with the theme 'Sacrifices Must Be Made'.</p>\n<p>(Includes a very buggy level editor.)</p>\n<p>Move the train all the way to the left, press left or right (or 'A' and 'D') to make it go.<br/>It will need fuel though, so better burn those valuables in the crates.<br/>To burn fuel, light up crates and boxes. Once they're all the way gone, it gets added to the meter top-right.<br/>To see what you've burned, keep an eye on the messages in the lower part of the screen.</p>\n<p>Troubleshooting:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Too slow? Press space or enter to turn off the special effects. NOTE: This was added while building the Windows version, after the Jam!

Press 'R' to restart.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Level Editor:</p>\n<p>Even more buggy than the game itself! :-)</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Press '[' (right-bracket) to unlock debug functionality.<br/>\u00a0- Press 'L' to switch between level and editing.<br/>\u00a0- Press 'R' reload the level.
