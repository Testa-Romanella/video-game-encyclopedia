Basic goal is to reach the top score. Honest and simple competition.<br/>Really relaxing, but dynamic gameplay awaits everyone from the first moments of the game.<br/>Control the little blob and gather the food. Become bigger and stronger.<br/>Get to fight other players, talk in chat, make friends and enemies.Game features <br/>Massive amount of the modes, PvP and PvE, elaborate social component and customisation options make the game really addictive!<br/>A single session takes from several minutes to however long you can stay on top. The game doesn't require a lot of your time, which isn't getting in a way of feeling all the dynamics and competition in the game.<br/>Multiplatform and multilanguage. You're playing with people from all around the world and different devices.<br/>Eat the weak, escape the strong, gather mass. Create clans, sets, coalitions. Conquer servers or whole modes and everyone will know that.Steam <br/>During the lifetime of Petridish many players have been asking to add the game to Steam. At that moment, unfortunately, it wasn't an option. Now we have a proper client, and we present our game to you.<br/>Publishing on Steam will establish an inflow of the new players, which is always good, because social component is one of the main pillars of the game.<br/>We're not here for money. Game doesn't require obligatory donations. It is completely free and balanced.<br/>Leave the comments, critique, wishes.
