And boy, has it been a journey.\u00a0\r\nHere is all you need to know to play the game!:\r\nYou are trying to find the ancient chest of gold from an old legend, but to do so, you must pass through multiple mazes first (this being the demo version, you won't get there just yet).\r\n\u00a0\r\nControls:\r\nArrow Keys to move\r\nSpace Bar\u00a0to shoot\r\nwasd Keys work but not well! You have been warned!!!\r\nThe \"Quit\" button at the end doesn't really work either, to end/leave the game, you have to hit the \"Escape\" key. This is because I directly converted a Windows build to WebGL so the Quit Application function doesn't exactly...work anymore.\u00a0Also WebGL's fullscreen function doesn't exactly look so great so I'd recommend not fullscreening the game.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes!\r\nIf you're here because\u00a0of a project, then welcome to my chaotic mess of a game! I really do hope you enjoy it, and please report all of the bugs! This helps me improve as a developer and learn more about the game engine. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're here because you are a friend of mine and wanted to see what I've been up to...this is the project I was talking about. I hope you like this more than I do, which, at this point, is not at all. But thanks so much for your continued love and support I can't wait to do some projects with y'all now that I\u00a0kinda know what I'm doing!\u00a0\r\nThanks,\u00a0\r\n~Winter Moon", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c3/8c3f8dc2a6badff2120325c1e4a5e038.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alphawintermoon"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
