It shouldn't be too much of a problem if you just chill.</p>\n<p>5 premade Levels + Level Editor</p>\n<p>Optional Nightmare and Jump Only mode</p>\n<p>The level editor has an issue where if you paste in data from a previously created level you can't change it. I use the Godot engine and as far as I can tell the values are identical whether or not the data is pasted or created through the editor. I use stepify() on all floats to round them to the nearest 0.1 and I made sure that values that should be integers are cast to integers before being added to the world data. If you have any advice on what is causing this issue I would greatly appreciate it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T13:56:13", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sulsadood"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
