With more chapters released each season, unravel the epic story arc underpinning the Kingdom Draw universe.<br/><br/><strong>Online Ladder Play</strong><br/><br/>Pit yourself against other players from around the world with cross-platform ladder play.

Matches in Kingdom Draw take place on a hexagonal grid where you play army, support, and beast cards on the map. Strategically control locations to earn more resources, take advantage of terrain, and be the first to destroy your opponent\u2019s castle. Use power cards to decimate your enemies, alter your cards\u2019 combat effectiveness, and modify the terrain. <br/><br/><strong>Friendly Matches</strong><br/><br/>Looking for something more casual? Stick with the devil you know and add friends to challenge them to friendly battles.
