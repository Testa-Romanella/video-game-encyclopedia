If you can share your first ending, that would be really cool.\u00a0</p><p>1. It's a bit difficult to describe the structure of this games story, primarily because it's pretty open-ended. There is no back story other than the main character being a cave raider.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. I decided to make the story in this way because I thought if I set up a more linear narrative, it would limit some of the outcomes I put in the story. In other words, I wanted to set it up in such a way that anything was possible, and the outcome of the story would solely rely on the player's choices.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T09:47:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a7/1a74507ebaf4070d319aadebb422e730.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spyder2047"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
