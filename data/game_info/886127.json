Confused, you start exploring. But soon you realize that things are not... normal in this hotel. Weird sounds and an ominous feeling of horror plague you. What will you discover... in Hotel 666?</p>\n<p>This is a free demo for a VR game I am developing. I hope you like it. Tested with Oculus Rift S. I am very interested in knowing if it works with other headsets, please let me know!<br/><br/>Please consider donating, it really helps support me as an indie developer, and it helps to allow me to afford the types of things that can make this game great, like models, sounds, voiceovers, and more. I have great things planned for this game!<br/></p>\n<p>More demos will follow as development continues.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T14:41:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44e/44e2b1e4a3526a571f22b74915167679.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mmyburg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
