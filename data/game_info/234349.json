That\u2019s it! Simple as it sounds, the levels get more and more taxing, though we can assure you that they are all actually solveable! Later levels see you splitting your block into to separately controllable pieces, use the spacebar to toggle between them. Other than that, everything else is pretty self explanatory. Be warned \u2013 once you start playing this you might find it hard to stop!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a984bec314acaa0dab1f2ebd6196cac_KJObWRc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["TTCX"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Beijing Tiantian Innovation Technology Co ,Ltd"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
