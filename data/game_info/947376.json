From the name (and whatever the hell that intro was) you can probably guess what it does, It procedurally generates little islands for you!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each island comes with a seed, but the seed only controls the name of the island and the shape. You can hit seed lock and regenerate to remake the features of an island!</p>\n<p>When you find a really cool island, you can hit the export button to save a screenshot of it straight to your downloads folder. You can either save it as a normal screenshot or as a postcard! (the postcard also has the name of the island on it)</p>\n<p>If you come across some nice islands, feel free to share them in the comments or on social media!</p>\n<p>And hey, thanks for playing! I know a lot of people won't see this but I really appreciate everyone who takes time out of their day to look at some funky ass islands.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T10:12:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e9/3e9732c5ee3bff58f314af36df9b04c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bonicle"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
