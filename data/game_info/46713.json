Dronihilators are the last resistance of man kind.<br/><br/>Prepare for battle and take the challenge of sharpening your target shooting skill to become the ultimate Dronihilator! <br/><br/><strong>The Arena</strong> Represents the place where you will train in order to gain the experience necessary in order to face the real threats. This room represents just a simulation so don't you worry, your life is not threatened, yet... <br/><br/><strong>The Weapons</strong> You will be equipped with the main weapons of a Dronihilator: two laser guns that are capable of neutralizing the enemy with just a single well placed shot. Despite their powerful shot, the main weakness is the fact that a cooldown time is necessary after each gunfire. Using both weapons can really make the difference! <br/><br/><strong>The Enemies</strong> Their army consists of different types of drones, each having a different behavior. With some luck, our spies have been able to identify several enemy units and we managed to copy their behavior and use it in our simulator.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Scout K072</strong> - It's meant for spying the enemy. Once it spots a target, it notifies his allies to start fire.<br/></li><li><strong>Supplier J017</strong> - This drone is terrible in combat but it carries a healing kit. Destroy it to restore +20HP.<br/></li><li><strong>Thor W11</strong> - Once it\u2019s destroyed it generates a short powerful burst of electromagnetic energy. It instantly kills everything.<br/></li><li><strong>Destroyer O53</strong> - It\u2019s a killing machine designed for one thing: destroy enemies. His major weakness is that it needs a short time to enter combat mode.<br/></li><li><strong>Ghost Z9</strong> - Lose it from your sight and it will hit you behind your back.</li></ul><br/><strong>The Competition</strong> As in any war, the elite soldiers will always be going to make a step forward. Prove your fighting skill by killing as many enemies as possible and gain a spot in the Top 10 Elite Dronihilators! <br/><br/>How long will you survive?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f98ea5ed1691367244a29fd8d922a55.jpg", "website": "http://dronihilation.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zynk Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Zynk Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
