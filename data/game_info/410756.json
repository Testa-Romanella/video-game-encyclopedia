It\u2019s a short, experimental puzzle game that uses video feedback loops as the main interaction.</p>\n<p>Players manipulate the video feedback effects to guide particles home. Sliders at the bottom of the screen affect the feedback parameters. None of the effects are clear; experimentation and accidental video art are part of the process!</p>\n<p>This project was made in openFrameworks and uses the Video_Waaaves engine by Andrei Jay to create the feedback.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Game by Andy Wallace'<br/>andmakes.com<br/>https://twitter.com/Andy_Makes</p>\n<p>Video_Waaaves by Andrei Jay\u00a0<br/>https://github.com/ex-zee-ex/VIDEO_WAAAVES_sqrt-PI-</p>\n<p>Fonts:\u00a0<br/>ChevyRay - Chocolate\u00a0<br/>Mono ChevyRay - Rise.ttf<br/>https://chevyray.itch.io/pixel-fonts</p>\n<p>Made in openFrameworks<br/>http://openframeworks.cc/</p>\n<p>Created at LIU Post for Global game Jam 2020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:52:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6a/f6a35678b4cf9421c2ff3724f70b93fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["AndyMakes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
