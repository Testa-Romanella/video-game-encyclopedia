You get a certain amount of steps</p>\n<p>2. You can't step where you have already stepped.</p>\n<p>3. The starting spot will refill your ... stamina, I guess?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. The starting spot will spawn a clone you can collide with who does exactly what you did last cycle.</p>\n<p>5. The goal is to each cycle do or start something then,\u00a0go back to the starting spot</p>\n<p>6. If you get stuck or want to restart\u00a0hit the right shoulder button.</p>\n<p>The game was meant to be more of a rhythm game with different controller inputs (Hence the \"Hard Mode\" version),\u00a0but I hadn't really balanced for that yet.\u00a0 I will post a link to a newer balanced version which is the best of the easy and the hard version.</p>\n<p>It's like 1/4 as good as it could be with a little more time, but considering I did it in roughly 24 hours and didn't entirely neglect my kids during that time I'd say its ... not bad.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for playing.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>-HeartLamp</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:57:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/702/702aeace81992b20ea912eea4a9195f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HeartLamp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
