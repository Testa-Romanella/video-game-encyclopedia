Spin the slots to determine your moves and show everyone who's the boss in this turn based roguelike RPG. Boost your Ego to unlock new classes and zones to explore!<br/><br/>Are you bored waiting for your queue to pop? Come on over to the Combat Casino where a run is 15-30 minutes with the oddball runs lasting a few hours. Don't worry though, there are no time limits so you can minimize and do something else if you need to. (or if you need to pay attention to the zoom call) I wanted to make something that I would want to play while waiting for some of my daily work-from-home downtime.<br/><br/>Combat Casino is a passion project of mine and I have plans to support it for a while. I want to continue to add new events, perks, totems, zones, monsters and classes as time goes on. My goal was to make a full game that would deserve a real release. I hope you enjoy it!<br/><br/>Want to participate in the creation?
