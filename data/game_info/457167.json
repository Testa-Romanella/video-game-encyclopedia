It is so casual and so simple, you can barely call it \"<em>a\u00a0game</em>\".<em>(Ha-ha)</em></p>\n<p>It'll only ask you to repeat a small numeral sequence. That easy! <em>But the sequence will be shown for only a second.</em></p>\n<p>So it is recommended not to blink... And it is\u00a0better not to yawn...</p>\n<p>In a nutshell:\u00a0remember precisely, think quickly, click surely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Behind the scenes</strong></p>\n<p>Inspired by science videos of Japanese researches about chimp's memory. Surprisingly, our little brothers have better (<em>or different?</em>) short-term memory then humans. They would easily beat this game.
