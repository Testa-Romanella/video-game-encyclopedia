At the very beginning, presenting itself as a normal PowerPoint presentation, this presentation is actually made in unity. After the 3rd slide, the computer gets a glitch effect and then fakes a blue screen of death. Later, the unity application mimics the user's desktop (A screenshot of the desktop is taken via a supporting c# application before the unity application launches), and causes an error to popup on the user's simulated desktop when he tries to click something. When he gets rid of said error, a second one appears and bounces around the screen. The presentation then reverts itself. After a few more slides, the player gains the ability to move in a 3d environment, in contrast to before, where he was fixed on a world canvas at a certain angle. This ability then reveals that the entire presentation was actually made in unity engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T19:49:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/978/9785e6f9919b3eebee9847a3df744c12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ANormalPerson1"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
