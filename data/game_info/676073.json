Some crates are big and some are small, which interferes with pile physics. Other crates are explosive and they can destroy other crates and also knock down piles.</p>\n\n<p>Changelog</p>\n<ul><li>Fixed the bug that didn't count the number of boxes</li><li>Fixed bug that didn't allow 180 degree boxes to be the base of a pile</li><li>Fixed bug that counted as pile blocks in 180 degrees</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:40:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/264/264d40a7fdd5dae8939f99df4390c332.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nulldreams"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
