Audio is pulled from official games.\u00a0No plans to expand on this at the moment, but I may polish it a little further when I have some free time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T07:27:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a4/1a48d2828fd39e40b0f817e59942a7c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lefthandedheather"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
