{"id": 108015, "slug": "no-other-medicine", "name": "No Other Medicine", "name_original": "No Other Medicine", "description": "<p><em>No Other Medicine</em> is a short visual novel (roughly half an hour) created for the 2017 TyranoBuilder Spring Game Jam, with the theme of \"fresh starts\". It's about the potential beginning of a new friendship between Jess, a lonely and awkward PhD student, and Sybil, a snarky and sarcastic former student of the same university. It's mostly linear with a few dialogue choices, and contains a small amount of strong language and references to violence. I hope you enjoy it! Feel free to comment here or in the LemmaSoft thread if you have any feedback for me.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Writing - Jane Titor (janetitor.itch.io)</p>\n<p>Sprite &amp; CG Art - Mikomi Kisomi (mikomikisomi.itch.io)</p>\n<p>Background Art - Uncle Mugen, Neo Himeism</p>\n<p>Engine - TyranoBuilder Visual Novel Studio by STRIKEWORKS</p>\n<p>Beta Testers - 8cccc9, Bunny Advocate</p>\n<p>Music - \"Flying Over Ancient Lands\" and \"92nd Floor\" by Eric Matyas (soundimage.org), \"Mysterious Jazzy BGM 100114\" by N.C.H.
