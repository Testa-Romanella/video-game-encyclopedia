The flow of the game will be shaped by the decisions we make in our game. You can either get caught up in this glamorous life and watch the ruin of your career, or you can live the rockstar dream.<br/><br/><br/>If you want to be a rock star, of course you have to compose great songs and play the guitar well. Master your guitar playing and improve your stats. Upgrade your equipment and stats to play better venues and expand your repertoire.<br/><br/><br/>Are you successful in your love life? Show your skills. Hang out at the bar, relax, and look for a partner. Don't forget to have a few drinks for courage.<br/><br/><br/>Becoming a world star is not an easy journey, constantly improve yourself.<br/><br/><br/>Expensive instruments, fast cars, luxury homes... Or continue living at grandma's house. The choice is yours.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T07:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff9/ff9dfff9de807d8ee73cd8861c6e999f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HOGO Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["HOGO Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
