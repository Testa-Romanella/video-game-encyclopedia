Half asleep, he reached across the unmade bed, seeking to feel the soft touch of her scented skin under his hand.<br/><br/>But she was not there.<br/><br/>The front door was open, forced. Someone had come in and taken his beloved Samantha.<br/><br/>A sweet and familiar aroma came to him from the East. Now he could search for her and he will. He will not stop until he finds her and whoever had dared to do this. And when he finds him...\"<br/><br/><br/>The original Bloody Paws is a curious item: a side-scrolling beat \u2018em up in which players control a melodramatic werewolf on a quest to find his missing wife and fight a horde of eccentric creatures such as invisible men, rope-jumping mummies, off-brand superheroes, and the Frankenstein monster. The game also had an unfortunate behind-the-scenes story: the publisher released the game before it was completed, without even informing (or paying!) the developers.<br/><br/>In 2020, a completed version of Bloody Paws was released for the Amstrad CPC.<br/><br/>I got the blessing from the creator of Bloody Paws, Juan Carlos Sanchez, to bring this cool relic of the past to the PC and give it the full Merso X treatment. Free from the limitations of the 8-bit systems of the 80s, Bloody Paws: Passion Unleashed will inject the original game with color, gameplay polish, additional animations, extra levels, and more!<br/><br/>Presently, the game features 7 playable stages, multiple enemy types, music, and story cutscenes. In essence, the original Bloody Paws game from 1990 by MAR Entertainment has been fully remade with updated colors, music, sound effects, fine-tuned hit detection, and additional moves for the main character.<br/> <br/>The final release will feature:<br/><ul><li>Additional and expanded stages<br/></li><li>Boss fights<br/></li><li>Additional items and power ups to pick up<br/></li><li>Additional music tracks<br/></li><li>Spanish translation<br/></li><li>Additional tweaks and adjustments as needed</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T03:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be477109568aaf62a7513975336d6f1.jpg", "website": "https://www.merso-x.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Merso X Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Merso X Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
