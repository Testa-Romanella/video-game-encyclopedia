Based on the cartoon, the player takes control of Daffy Duck and explores five fictional planets and saves the Earth. The object is to collect energy atoms to unlock the boss areas and defeat the bosses, whom upon defeating, opens up the next planet. This game has Rumble Pak support and allows the player to save the game directly to the cartridge with the battery back-up, rather than using a Controller Pack, as many other third-party titles on the Nintendo 64 used such to save game data.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/64376159f16b54f3fa50a24db4da2a7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Paradigm Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Infogrames", "Infogrames Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
