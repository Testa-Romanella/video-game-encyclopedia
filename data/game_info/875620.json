{"id": 875620, "slug": "path-of-the-faoladh-demo", "name": "Path of the Faoladh (Demo)", "name_original": "Path of the Faoladh (Demo)", "description": "<p>Path of the Faoladh is a PSX style\u00a0Souls-Lite game made for the 32Bit Jam 2022.<br/></p>\n<p>You play as a Faoladh- a werewolf newly risen from the dead by the\u00a0ancient god\u00a0Crom Dahb. You must travel through the land of the dead to meet Crom and take back your soul, one way or another.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTENT WARNING:\u00a0</strong>Mild gore and body horror.</p><p><strong>Known Bugs: </strong>The game wasn't playtested extensively prior to the jam, so there are many bugs, and upgrades are functional but not well balanced. Swords can sometimes not appear in your hand after picking them up, causing you to be unarmed but still do damage. Swords can sometimes scale up or down after picking them up, even scaling down so far that they aren't visible.\u00a0Rael's bloodlust is attached to her health so enemies that drain bloodlust will kill her more quickly. The witcher can sometimes clip through their arena and end up outside in the swamp. Balvin can get stuck if you swap him for Rael. The rat king can knock dropped weapons outside of his arena. The rat king can stand up after death but this is only a visual bug. Balvin can't teleport to his combat room if he is following, causing the game to be unbeatable.</p>\n<p><strong>Code:</strong>\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/dazalius</p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong> https://rotsuoy.itch.io/<br/>-\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/rotsuoy</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong> https://itch.io/profile/tizianmusic<br/></p>\n<p><strong>https://soundcloud.com/user-998275070/sets/path-of-the-faoldah<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Aspects of this game had to be cut or reduced in order to complete it for the jam.
