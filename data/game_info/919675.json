[read description]", "description": "<p>To get this done in time for pixel day, I haven't had time to complete the lesser endings. I will update as soon as possible, but I don't want to rush things and I have a mock exam coming up. Basically when you get to said ending, it tells you what happens next before showing the ending artwork. There shouldn't be any major bugs.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>I debated about actually publishing this due to me finding it cringe in some places and not looking as polished as the others: both visually and gameplay wise. Then I realised that people actually like this for some reason but I can't imagine this winning anything\u00a0</p>\n<p>due to how inconsistent it is as this took me 10 months and my art/music/writing skills have improved since then. But who knows? Maybe it'll turn into a meme.</p>\n\n<p>This was mostly inspired by undertale, with some deltarune and henry stickmin collection chucked in for good measure. And if you've played, or at least seen, these games then it's <strong>very</strong> obvious.\r\n</p>\n<p>This was created for the Pixel Day Contest 2023.\r\n</p>\n<p>The length is about 30 minuits if you want to get every ending.\r\n</p>\n<p>It doesn't save your progress ('cause scratch).\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Newgrounds page:\u00a0https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/project/4457359<br/></p>\n<p>Website: https://sci-fi-rairoboska.carrd.co/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T19:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cb/3cb0fcf0039b606119f767d7905f26f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PearlHikara"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
