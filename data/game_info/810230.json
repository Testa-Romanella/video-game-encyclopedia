{"id": 810230, "slug": "epsilon-fortress", "name": "Epsilon Fortress", "name_original": "Epsilon Fortress", "description": "<p>\n</p>\n<p>Epsilon Fortress's idea came after thinking about what the opposite of Ultrakill could be. A slow as possible shooter game with tedious mechanics instead of a fast paced shooter with simple mechanics.</p>\r\nStory:\r\n<p>You are a lost soldier, behind the enemy lines. Your mother-ship was <br/>destroyed and you are stranded in orbit around the machine's home-world. Your faction has lost, you have no way of going back, you lost all communication and most importantly, they destroyed your AI. It is time for them to pay for what they did. You don't have anything else to do anyway, might as well take them down with you!</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p><strong>Controls on foot:</strong></p>\n<ul><li> WASD to move around when walking inside the mech,</li><li>SPACE to interact what you are looking at</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls in seat:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WS to throttle up and down</li><li>AD to throttle left and right rotation</li><li>Z to center rotation throttle</li><li>X to stop the mech</li><li>LEFT and RIGHT CLICK to shot with your left and right weapon</li><li>SPACE to interact with your dash buttons</li><li>TAB to leave the seat</li></ul><p>To test more stuff, you can press F2 to get more than enough resources to unlock and make everything, so feel free to test it out!<br/></p>\n<p>You are free to walk in the mech and interact with the displays and buttons. The first thing you will want to do is turn on your mech and select a mission right outside the cockpit. You have the engineering on the right, where you can research new techs, build new modules and weapons and repair the mech. On the left is the cooling tank and the weapon bay, where you can change your weapons. You start with only the MGUNS but can unlock new ones.</p>\n<p>Once you are in a mission, you can still move around in the mech to make ammos, use the cooling tank and change weapons. Your mech is heavily armored but not indestructible. Repairing it can only be done in orbit, outside of missions. Be mindful of your heat level as the mech will shutdown if it reaches 100.</p>\n<p>Once a mission is complete, you will hear a little jingle. You can stay and try to gather more resources or leave with the mission selection panel by hitting \"Return\", immobilizing the mech, getting picked back to orbit.</p><p>The game saves whenever you come back to orbit, so you can continue playing in more than one sitting. If you want to reset or edit you save, you can (for now) go to your %appdata% folder and delete/edit the save or from linux in your ~/.local/share/Epsilon Fortress folder.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T14:11:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d27f5d662da4810ce47c96e45f12b1f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Double Wookie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
