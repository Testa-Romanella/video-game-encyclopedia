While I love games about history, for a small game like this, I thought digging up things on another planet would be the most fun.</p>\n<p>This is an ever-improving alpha version of the game, building on the version\u00a0 submitted (barely in time) for the jam. I\u00a0have a long list of improvements still on the docket.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to\u00a0Sean S. LeBlanc for several of his invaluable Bitsy hacks. I couldn't have made a game like this without them.</p>\n<p>Feedback is much appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2ee106e1978dd241a7484858f9756a0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chris Floyd"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
