The picture will be used \n      as targets that pop up from various holes and the player must use the \n      stylus to tap them back into their holes. The faster this can be done, \n      and without making mistakes, the more combos are achieved. As the player \n      continues earning combos, the picture displayed on the top screen will \n      begin to display graphical changes, such as bruises, bugs, black eyes, \n      bandages, and scars. The simple game design and easy, intuitive controls \n      make it a game that the whole family can enjoy.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/588/588d6ac8a1204e6c0d5e8682732caf52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Agetec"], "esrb_rating": null}
