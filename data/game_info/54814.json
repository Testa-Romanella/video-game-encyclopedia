The cartridge is dual-format, allowing it to also run on the original Game Boy with some gameplay differences. The game is the first in a series to star Conker the Squirrel after he initially appeared as a playable character in Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64. It is the only one to feature Conker in a lighthearted and family friendly game, whereas his later games (Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day and Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded) would contrastingly be adult-oriented.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-12T02:08:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/918/9189a659c8fb12114cf0fc8844847699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Rare"], "esrb_rating": null}
