Players must learn to use tools they wield and the minotaurs own attacks to drop the minotaur into a bottomless abyss. Players play as an ancient warrior wielding a crossbow and a sword and must use their maneuverability to avoid the minotaurs attacks while lighting torches to signal walls to lower. </p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Dineth Dissanayake - Project Manager<br/>Gareth Haage - Lead Programmer<br/>Eli Deeth - Programmer<br/>Toby Welsh - Designer<br/>Jake Garrett - Designer</p><p>Aidan - Animator<br/>Brennan - Animator<br/>Michael - Animator<br/>Tyler - Animator</p><p>Simon Navakas - Audio<br/></p><p>Special Thanks:<br/>Tony Parmenter <br/>Steve Halliwell<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/050/0503ce613a145c5c4ff7fb9038dd555c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DinethD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
