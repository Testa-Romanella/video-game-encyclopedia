The Assets are mainly from Craftpix. My husband helped me with the balancing, play testing and searching for sounds. All code is written by me.</p>\n<p><strong>Future development</strong></p>\n<p>The game is planned as a multiplayer game. Each player does not send the mobs to himself, but to his opponent. Within the Game Jam it was not possible to implement it that way. Please let me know if you like the game and want me to develop it further!\u00a0If I get enough feedback, I will develop this game further.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>If you have any ideas, wishes or criticism, just write me!
