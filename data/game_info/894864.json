You are an expert at your job and you want to get the things done quickly. You are on a hike across the country, walking from town to town, banishing demons from houses. A boring classic routine.</p>\n<p>You have clearly mastered the job and are fed up with all these demon nonsense. You just want to finish the job as fast as possible to get the money and find a new client. Your body is quite muscular, you will probably have to be careful not to break everyone's furniture, or you could also not care.
