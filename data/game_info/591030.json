Neo-Zero features highly unsafe <strong>lab tests</strong> (puzzles) and <strong>rhythmic battles</strong> against husky military recruits.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, a scientist created the Neo-Zero\u2122 Simulation Software to simulate a real world with real people. Their intent was to perform experiments on these virtual people. Shockingly, the simulated world devolved into a dystopia controlled by a single, abusive government. The world had started to build an artificial intelligence that could break itself out of Neo-Zero, so the scientist shut the Neo-Zero project down.<br/>... two decades later, the (now broke) scientist decided to sell Neo-Zero as a video game.<br/><br/>As you boot up your copy of Neo-Zero for the first time, you will be entered into the world that the scientist had shut down.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>You play as Apollo</strong>, an aspiring junior scientist at Oxylabs who is forced to perform tests using Oxylabs\u2019 Propulsion Gun Prototype. During a morning of testing, Apollo finds himself stuck in the middle of a sticky situation: a military-enforced shutdown of the unethical Oxylabs.<br/><br/><strong>Aela </strong>serves as the overseer to your tests on the day of the Oxylabs shutdown. She assists you on the journey to escape the facilities and prevent the government from laying their hands on Oxylabs\u2019 most powerful device: Project Foxtrot.<br/><br/>After Oxylabs researchers determined that their world had a 99% chance of being a computer simulation, they developed <strong>Project Foxtrot</strong>, an artificial intelligence designed to exploit a glitch in the simulation. However, leaving Foxtrot powered on for more than 5 minutes has resulted in the simulated world falling apart...<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Ferdinand</strong> is a coworker who led Oxylabs' Project Foxtrot. He may have the solution to stopping Project Foxtrot from destroying the world.<br/><br/>Perhaps <strong>Bonnie</strong> can help you find Ferdinand. Bonnie is a young entrepreneur who runs a chemical factory and is ready to make the deal of a lifetime. Bonnie may not realize it, but she has a stronger connection to Ferdinand than she is aware of.<br/><br/>You meet many other <strong>scientists </strong>throughout the game. Some of them do not take their careers as seriously as you do.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Soldiers </strong>are trained to capture any scientists they come across. Like typical video-game grunts, these soldiers have disgusting personalities and a terrible sense of humour!<br/><br/><strong>Brobots</strong> are friendly devices which can feed you with corny jokes in times of despair. However, their software is pretty fragile, so handle them with care!<br/><br/>??? ????? <strong>?? ??????</strong> ? ?????? ????????? ?? ??????? ??? ?? ?????? ?? ??????? ????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ?????? ? ??????? ?? ???????? ???? ????? ??????????<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Battles</strong>: battles against enemies require you to press the WASD keys to deflect projectiles to the rhythm of the music.<br/><br/><strong>Puzzles:</strong> you will encounter several puzzles that you must complete during your testing as an Oxylabs researcher. These puzzles feature bridges, locked doors, teleporters and the occasional riddle!<br/><br/><strong>Money:</strong> you can spend the world currency, Jimmies, on snacks, lavish dining, as well as phone calls with your little brother Vlad.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As you struggle to escape Oxylabs and fight against the government, several characters develop along the way \u2013 including those that desire control over the artificial intelligence. Do you align yourself with or against the government? Can you save your family from impoverishment? Will you be able to stop the rogue intelligence from destroying the Neo-Zero simulation? That's up to you to decide.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T02:58:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d7/4d73d8effce4f10e054534dca0daa567.jpg", "website": "https://www.neozerogame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert Ciborowski"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Robert Ciborowski"], "esrb_rating": null}
