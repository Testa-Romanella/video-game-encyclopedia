{"id": 938090, "slug": "deck-em-2", "name": "Deck 'Em!", "name_original": "Deck 'Em!", "description": "Deck \u2019Em! is a solitaire-style boxing card game. Try and survive twelve rounds with the Champ, and you\u2019ll be a winner in my books, kid. Like solitaire, the object of the game is to draw and place based on a sequence of numbers and rules. Each fight is different. Sometimes you\u2019ll win. Sometimes you\u2019ll lose. Much like in life, kid. The most important thing to remember is if you get knocked down, you get your ass back up.<br/><br/>Here are a few tips before your first fight. There are a fixed number of cards (52) in a fight. Strategically play or hold the Punch, Block, and Heal cards dealt each round to make it to the end of the fight. You gotta know when to take a punch and when to throw one. Your prize money is your score, so be careful when you choose to make a gamble.<br/><br/>Remember old-school solitaire? The one that came with your PC? Much like the good \u2019ol days, Deck \u2019Em! is a game you can open up during your nine-to-five. Hop in and out of it as you code, make art, take notes, enter data, or zone out to during meetings. It\u2019s set to a default windowed mode to let you sneak in and out as you please.<br/><br/>Anyways, you didn\u2019t hear any of that from me.
