Follow our heroine as she makes her way to save her family from the risen undead and find her truth behind Z After.<br/><br/>This is a two-stage alpha demo of my game Z After that I've been working on for about\u00a0five years. The project is currently on hold due to a lack of funds, I'm not here to beg for money(could help push production along :O) What I'm really wanting is your insight on gameplay. What you really like and dislike about it, what could be done better, and overall your experience with Z After.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Big thanks from the Z After team!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T10:06:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7e/f7e5c4f40227826ee7093181a61b650b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thorMobGeeks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
