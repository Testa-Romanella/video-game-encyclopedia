It also means that enemies can't see you when you move. It is a game where you need to protect an altar from creatures called Umbras by placing traps and baits. The Game is divided into two phases; day and night. In the day you place traps and baits planning your moves against the Umbras. In the night you must discreetly move and activate your traps but don't get caught by the Umbras or it will be game over.<br/><br/>Windows 64 bit Build Only</p>\n<p>WASD to move<br/>Right Click for Crytals ( to bait enemies)<br/>Left Click for Traps\u00a0<br/>Space to activate traps during the night<br/><br/>Made by 5 lovely people !!! :3<br/>Nicolas Galipeau<br/>Chlo\u00e9 Brodeur<br/>\u00c9mile Brodeur<br/>Annie Lafreni\u00e8re<br/>Madeleine St-Pierre</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3ec55e0c9dae841264759acaab09f5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BaecunDrop"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
