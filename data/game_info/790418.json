It was well known for it's adult jokes and excentrical\u00a0<strong><strong>caricature</strong>s</strong>!</p>\n\r\nHow to play you may ask?\r\n<p>In \"<strong>Don't Say This Senator!</strong>\"\u00a0you play as a <strong>television manager</strong> in charge of a <strong>problematic senator</strong>,\u00a0your objective is to <strong>keep your</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>interlocutor\u00a0</strong><strong>calm</strong> until the end of the broadcast while avoiding dropping your viewer rate to 0.</p>\n<p>You have <strong>several tools</strong> at your disposal :</p>\n<p>- <strong>Spacebar</strong> to\u00a0censor the speech of the\u00a0senator (you regain a percentage when the journalist changes subject, be careful to not lose it all or you won't be able to do much...)</p>\n<p>- <strong>Leftarrow</strong> to turn on\u00a0a fan that relax the Senator if he gets angry (but careful, after each use the fan will need to recharge due to low budgets...)\u00a0</p>\n<p>- <strong>Rightarrow</strong> to raise back that wild\u00a0microphone-pole that keeps falling (be quick before anyone sees this nonsense!)</p>\n<p>- It's <strong>game over</strong> for you if the rating down on the left goes to <strong>0</strong>, as you need to keep viewers on the channel, <strong>make sur to last</strong> <strong>until the end of the interview</strong>.
