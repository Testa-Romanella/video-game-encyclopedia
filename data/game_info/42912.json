{"id": 42912, "slug": "gigantic", "name": "Gigantic", "name_original": "Gigantic", "description": "<p>Gigantic is a MOBA game with a unique twist. Each team in Gigantic has an enormous Guardian, who is the core of the gameplay.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>The players fight each other in the teams of five &quot;heroes.&quot; The game has a roster of over 20 unique and named heroes. They belong to 10 classes with different abilities, such as melee-oriented Bruiser, a creature-conjuring Summoner, a Healer, or a Tank. The players can upgrade their characters right in the middle of a match. They can also obtain cosmetic improvements through in-game currency or microtransactions.</p>\n<h3>Guardians</h3>\n<p>Each team has a Guardian, a huge powerful monster who accompanies the players. The Guardian is AI-controlled and only enters the fight upon seeing the enemy. However, Guardian&#39;s attacks are the most powerful. The goal of each match is to eliminate the enemy Guardian while protecting your own Guardian. Killing the enemy players doesn&#39;t count for victory score.</p>\n<p>Each match has several milestones. When a team manages to injure the enemy Guardian to a certain point, the two Guardians will fight each other in an even called The Clash. Dusing Clashes, the Guardians will destroy and reshape much of the game&#39;s map. It significantly influences the gameplay and also adds to the sense of the Guardians&#39; enormous size and power.</p>\n<h3>Shutdown</h3>\n<p>Since August 2018, the servers of Gigantic are no longer available.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.arcgames.com/en/arc-news/detail/10966193-gigantic-server-shutdown\">Official gigantic shutdown notice</a></p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2017-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T12:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/1749429e194be9f3fc0ecc1f98912c44.jpg", "website": "http://www.gogigantic.com/", "rating": 2.85, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 47, "owned": 1034, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 96, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 130, "suggestions_count": 532, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 130, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Motiga"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Perfect World Entertainment", "Motiga"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
