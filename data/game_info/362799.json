You're Mark \"Tough Guy\" Tyler and you've just defended your your Heavyweight title from the 9th consecutive time. After demolishing the best boxers on the planet. It's now time to face-off with the best in the Universe. The Intergalactic Boxing Federation (IGBF) has invited you to go head-to-head with 12 of their greatest fighters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrom metallic Cyborgs, to heavy hitting mutants, you'll trade punches with opponents whose strength, stamina and speed are like nothing you've ever seen. (9763 Borg has a hook that could level a building. Granthnox 4 has a body that isn't like a tank, it is a tank!)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut you are \"Tough Guy\" a boxer whose legendary talents have brought aliens from across the cosmos to see you fight. Workout in the IGBF Training Ship to hone your skills to peak condition, then, when the bell ringts, show those intergalactic showboaters some real boxing... earth style. Snape those jabs, throw those combinations and deliver those hammer-like rights.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf pure technique doesn't stop these sluggers (and with the best of them it won't), get hold of those Power Punches. They'll guarantee to send your tin coated opponent to the junkyard and you to a new title: undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the Universe.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPower Punch II is a boxing game played in 3rd person view. Beat all 12 enemies and become the champion of the universe!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/231/231c864af6e47068fc393f8e5428e399.jpg", "website": "http://pikointeractive.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beam Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Piko Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
