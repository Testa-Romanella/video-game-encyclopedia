The rope follows the player around, and can attach to walls and connect to poles. When a loop is connected, the door opens and you are free to continue on your merry way! Be careful for spikes as they snap your rope and kill you! Good luck, you'll need it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T16:12:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcc/dcc39c276c2796688bdb8b43b970996b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["HackFight", "PadjokeJ"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
