{"id": 101759, "slug": "sinarun-itch", "name": "SinaRun (itch)", "name_original": "SinaRun (itch)", "description": "SinaRun is a minimalist 3D platform/racing game. <br/>\r\n\r\nThe goal? Simply make the best time! What makes you different from the other players is not the cheap abilities you can get on the playground. It's how good you will be at optimizing jumps, turns and general route-finding. <br/>\r\n\r\nThe game is designed to not lead the players toward any levels. While all levels are (currently) pretty similar all levels feature slight changes in gameplay. Do you like small and quick jumps? Maybe you prefer bigger levels with turns and falls? What about sliding? <br/>\r\n\r\nFind a level you like, play it hundreds of times and eventually maybe be the best on the leaderboard!<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ :\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How does Leaderboards work between the normal and Steam versions?</strong><br/>\r\n\tLeadeboards are currently only available on Steam (see the next question for info)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can I buy this game on Steam?</strong><br/>\r\n\tYep! SinaRun is available on Steam. You'll get a Steam key if you buy on itch.io! Please note that the Steam version is always the more updated one and the DRM-Free versions is a few versions behind.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>The music is nice! Who made it?</strong><br/>\r\n\tGeneral Fuzz\r\n\t made it! It's very nice! Go check it out!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tMore songs will be added \r\nwith updates (and also sales. Licensing cost and stuff). Credit to him!\r\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>NOTE :</strong> Please note that even though the game is currently playable it do not feature that much content and is not polished YET. The game will be updated with more levels, game modes and general content.
