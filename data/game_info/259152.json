I wanted to make something kind of relaxing that evoked the feeling of traveling to a unfamiliar place through lighting and atmosphere. Every city is unique and has a dynamic\u00a0day/night cycle.\u00a0Special thanks to Khalkeus for the use of a few of his models\u00a0https://khalkeus.tumblr.com/. I had a lot of fun making this I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e1/4e13deef87ad184e90220a1760fbd794.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Potterfield"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
