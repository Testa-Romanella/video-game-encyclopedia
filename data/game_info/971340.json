You wake-up in a dark operating room, laying down on operating table. As you start finding your way out from the facility, you start to hear voices coming from other parts of the facility and face all kinds of disturbing things . Your only help is the flashlight, that you found from the room that you woke up, but unfortunately it is running out of batteries.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSolicitude Wake-up tries to imitate the real world interactions as closely as possible, while still maintaining ease enough controls to make the experience smooth. Nearly every object in game is interactable in some way. You can pick up and examine almost any object in game. You really need to carry the flashlight in your hand by keeping grabbing it. Try not to drop the flashlight when you get scared! You need to collect and change the batteries to the flashlight and you need to pick up and use the key cards to the door locks.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T14:04:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e85/e857634285fe0373343e8344600ac4ab.jpg", "website": "https://jrissa.wixsite.com/solicitudewakeup", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JR Production"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["JR Production"], "esrb_rating": null}
