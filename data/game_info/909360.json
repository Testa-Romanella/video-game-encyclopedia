Is this another farming game for Ludum Dare 52?\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Is it Tetris? Nope...</p>\n<p>Is it a Sudoku? Nope.</p>\n<p>Is it a farming game? Nope!</p>\n<p>It's HARVEEPS! Aliens are invading Earth... But YOU are the aliens, so it's fine!</p>\n<p>A game about playing aliens that are\u00a0harvesting humans (conveniently named \"happeeps\") by forming crop circles.</p>\r\nCrop circles, crop circles everywhere!\r\n<p>Happeeps are hiding in their wheat fields. But it's no use against you marvellous technology.</p>\n<p>You will be given shapes that you can use to draw crop circles in the fields, efficiently abducting the happeeps located where you're aiming.</p>\n<p>Be wary though, as harvested lands will summon angry humans (angreeps). These pesky angreeps will launch their fork at you to try stopping your invasion.</p>\r\nTake your time and choose wisely.\r\n<p>When completing a line / column or one of the big 9-tiles blocks, you will reset the zone, removing any angreeps contained in it. And it will restore the fields, so more happeeps will be able to appear. That's nice, huh!</p>\n<p>The more harvested tiles are on screen, the more likely angreeps will spawn. Choose wisely where you harvest!</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Click on things to do things.</p>\n<p>And you can press R or use the mouse scrollwheel\u00a0to rotate your currently selected shape.</p>\n\r\nIT'S\u00a0HARVESTING TIME!\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>AUDIO / GRAPHICS / VFX\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0<em>Thomas Lebrun</em>\u00a0(Raivk)</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0<em>Anatole Chaumont\u00a0</em>(CharlieTU)</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER</strong>\u00a0:\u00a0<em>Jean-Christophe Joubier</em>\u00a0(eFrag)</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER</strong>\u00a0: <em>Julia Marinelli</em>\u00a0(Donhadryel)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>UI\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0<em>Camila Suarez</em>\u00a0(Soulmakaira)</p>\n\n<p><strong>I'M A USELESS PIECE OF TEXT!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:04:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/607/6076da5ba5d7e5ac94a803689b030fe7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Teagher Studio", "eFrag", "camilasc", "CharlieTU", "JuliaMarinelli"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
