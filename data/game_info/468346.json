The theme is \"Out of Controll\" so I decided to make a topdown shooter where you have to escape a building.</p>\n<p>The catch is: you\u00a0don't have much controll over your character. You can't move it directly, but when you hit an enemy you get instantly teleported to its location.</p>\n<p>At first it might not seem as \"out of controll\" or as \"intense\" as the theme suggest, but, when you add a ton of enemies to fight at the same time along with lights that turn on and off and some moving platform, it gets pretty frenetic.</p>\n<p>Please give it a try, all you gotta do is download the zip file, extract its file and run the \"GMTK.exe\" file .\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0:D</p>\n<p>By the way. I didn't have much time to draw some coll looking sprites, so.. yeah xD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:38:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe7/fe7cb6ff209711bb21b18303c6618af3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TwentyFithJao"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
