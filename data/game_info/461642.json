We hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/>Fun fact: Did you know that there is actually a flower called a Happy Alien? (The alien you see in the scene!) We'd like to think that this is how they came to our world:<br/><br/><br/>\"Once upon a time, an Alien visited Earth. It was such a long time ago that magic still existed. The Alien, curious to see such a wonder never before known in his home planet, approached a young woman whose young and naive look belied the fact that she was actually the most powerful elemental witch in the world.<br/></p>\n<p>In the span of a moment, she started to make it rain. The Alien marveled at the warm drops on its orange skin and tasted their slight saltiness with his tongue. Only the Hoppocadaries of the Lake of Flames tasted savoury like this. Then the woman flicked her wrist and the drops stopped abruptly. A most magnificent artwork appeared on the sky- an arc of seven colours. What a wonderful planet, the Alien thought. He told this to the young woman- in Planet Zamazingo, every being told what they thought.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Luckily for him, the powerful witch was not easily spooked. She merely smiled at the Alien and welcomed him to our planet. The Alien was bewitched- not by a spell, but by her talent and kind heart. He offered her the droplet of tear in his possession. This was the tear that fell when Planet Zamazingo was saved from a Galactic War many light years ago, and the Queen Naninani cried for the first and last time in her life- shedding only one big tear of joy. It wasn\u2019t just a token that held great historical importance and sentimental value, the Queen Alien was the mother of all Aliens and even her tears had the potency to spawn baby aliens.   </p>\n<p>The witch and the alien became great friends after that, though the witch, familiar with humankind\u2019s fear of what they did not understand and certainly not inclined to be burnt at the stake, kept their friendship an utmost secret.\r\n  This friendship was sweet but not long lived, because the Alien had given most of his life to be able to make this journey. He knew his time was coming because his body was feeling lighter, just like his Alien father had told him it did when he passed away. He spent his last moments with the witch and told her he did not regret spending most of his life in transition through galaxies- not after having seen this wondrous place and knowing her precious friendship. Before he closed his eyes for eternity, the witch asked him how to birth the babies inside the Tear of Queen Naninani. The alien told him it was easy, she just needed to put them in the common Emere fruit and they would be born in no time.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Not wanting to break her friend\u2019s heart, the witch did not tell him that the Emere fruit was only found at the Zamazingo Planet\u2019s soil. Instead she told him she was so happy he came here and that she would remember him always.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Many days after his passing, the witch wanted to commemorate him and used all her magic to turn the spawn inside Queen Naninani\u2019s Tear to beautiful, delicate flowers.\r\n  </p>\n<p>They looked just like her friend, their shaped resembled his oval head and they were orange.\r\n  </p>\n<p>And, of course\u2026\r\n  </p>\n<p>They looked very happy, just like he always was.\r\n  </p>\n<p>And thus the Happy Alien were born.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T06:08:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a19/a1919a891e1585e1d294da501cf61da4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Happy Alien Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
