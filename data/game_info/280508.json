Two women are in love; one is the princess of an established kingdom, while the other is an adventurer. The adventurer is thrown in jail when seen by the guards for a mysterious reason. The adventurer plots her escape and quest to reunite with the love of her life.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move (Desktop), or swipe in the direction to move, while holding in the direction after swiping moves faster (Mobile). Walk into objects to interact with them.\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dev Notes:</strong></em> This is my entry for the Bitsy Secret Santa event. This game was made for FreckledFemme, and the themes were:</p>\n<ul><li>Lesbian</li><li>Adventure</li><li>Fantasy</li></ul>\n<p>After hearing what the themes were, I was very excited to be able to make a game like this. I had some plans on making games with these themes, so this was a great opportunity to try it out. There are some stealth mechanics in here, trying to push the Bitsy medium with this kind of gameplay. I also included some references to the Bitsy community in here. I hope all of you enjoyed it!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37e/37e0f25183588751682f9bb6175d9ca3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Stewart"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
