{"id": 429985, "slug": "heirloom-whitebox", "name": "Heirloom (Whitebox)", "name_original": "Heirloom (Whitebox)", "description": "<p>Over the past week, major iterations were made to reduce the prodigious scope we had for our initial game, \"Pale Forest.\" Originally, Pale Forest was a game that took place in an open world environment in the forests, and there were two buildings that the player had to visit to complete certain tasks. The objective of Pale Forest was to find the missing brother of the player using evidence and clues around the forest to find a trace of where he may be. Because the scope was quite large with multiple story buildings, it would be quite a challenge to have everything done within deadline.</p>\n<p>As a resolve to our issue, we reworked the design of the game to come up with something completely new. The concept was still the same - to find/seek something. Heirloom was birthed by the idea of finding an heirloom left by ancestors to escape the reality of the player's current situation. Riddled by monsters and evil apparitions, the player would have to explore a mansion that belonged to their ancestors. There they will search for an heirloom to escape to a different dimension of their reality to be a safe once again. However, to get to the heirloom, the player will have to be\u00a0stealthy around the mansion to retrieve keys and objects to unlock different rooms.</p>\n<p>To make the whitebox happen, we assigned each other different rooms and compiled them into one scene. Clinton was responsible for the atrium, dining room and kitchen; David was responsible for the basement and library; Jeshua was responsible for the bedrooms (essentially the second floor). With the rooms completed, we were able to connect them using a sketch of the top-down layout Clinton made with connecting hallways and walls.</p>\n<p>What we kept the same were the artistic/visual style and the genre with similarities in mechanics and objectives.\u00a0Overall, our contributions and critical thinking has allowed us to make a game (whitebox)\u00a0using concepts that were previously ideated from Pale Forest.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f50/f50f332089051e66a6317e31efd680aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jeshua Johnson", "davidsjcha", "ClintonThai"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
