{"id": 673649, "slug": "ignotum-jayllax", "name": "Ignotum (Jayllax)", "name_original": "Ignotum (Jayllax)", "description": "<p>A concept demo for my first-ever game project. <em>Ignotum.</em></p>\n<p><em>Ignotum</em> is a top-down action adventure\u00a0RPG game with inspiration taken from games like Undertale, Celeste, and Deltarune. So heavy emphasis on characters, story and exploration/secrets!</p>\n<p><strong>But what makes my game different from any other RPG Maker game? Well, let me tell you...</strong></p>\n<p>The idea is that the surface-level story is what you get to see and learn through a normal/casual playthrough without too much thinking and exploration.</p>\n<p>But the deep and more exciting\u00a0story is found\u00a0hidden throughout the world. It's not going to be easy to find. You'll have to read into small things and gather clues.\u00a0Will you be able to uncover the mystery\u00a0of\u00a0<em>Ignotum</em>? We'll see.</p>\n<p><strong>Have fun and any feedback is appreciated! It'll still be a long long time before it's even close to being a finished full game. My plan is to create a unique style so everything will look very different when it is out. I will post updates on this page when I've made new progress. If you really like my idea and the demo and want to support me, I would really appreciate\u00a0a donation! It helps out a ton and will boost my </strong><strong>motivation to keep on working on\u00a0this project! But more importantly,\u00a0</strong><strong>\u00a0it will also give me more time to work on the\u00a0project!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you if you've donated or even played this demo! I hope to see you at release!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T08:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe6f866d3436bb8f1c9e574d668b2199.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jayllax"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
