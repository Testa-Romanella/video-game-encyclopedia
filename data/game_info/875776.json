I wouldn\u2019t send you to that evil place and put your life at risk for all the treasures in the world. But I know I can\u2019t change your mind and I respect your decision. I\u2019d love to help you more but all I can give you is information. Believe me, you will need all the information you can get.\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The castle you are about to enter is magic. The legends say whoever reaches the lowest floor of this castle finds treasures beyond their dreams. Of course there is a catch: The castle is filled with death traps.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0There are many rumors to what these traps are, but nobody lived through them to tell the tale. After all, once you go in, there is no coming out until you succeed or die. But be brave, there is hope.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Once you reach the castle door <strong>don\u2019t enter right away</strong>. Look around you for a bit. <strong>You\u2019ll find there are a few people who live along those streets. Talk to them.</strong> They know about this castle more than you\u2019d think. Make no mistake, they won\u2019t want to help you. These are not normal people. They are cursed with the castle\u2019s influence. Don\u2019t ask me how I know this, but they are the castle\u2019s servants. They are the key to this secret. Do whatever you can to convince them to help you. This is the only way you can get out of that cursed castle alive.\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Don\u2019t forget this: <strong>Once you ask them for help about the castle\u2019s secrets, there is no turning back. You can\u2019t convince them afterwards. It\u2019s essential to do whatever you can to convince them before asking for their help.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Ask them about each other. Observe them, observe your surroundings. Only then you will know what they want to hear.\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 So, heed your father\u2019s words and came to us alive and well.\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your loving father.\u201d\r\n <br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Talk to the villagers.
