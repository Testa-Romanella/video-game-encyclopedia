Try to aim them at the nosy neighbour\u00a0\u00a0farmers, and get them BEFORE they reach your Miracle Potato Tower at the right most side of the map.</p>\n<p>Some of your farmer neighbours recognise the irony of you shooting Miracle\u00a0potatoes at them and can catch the potatoes out of the air, allowing them to try and leave before \u00a0reaching the Potato Tower.</p>\n<p>As you only have 10 potatoes to fire, you will have to strategise, and hit as MANY farmers with as few potatoes as possible. \u00a0Then, if you ever run out of potatoes, it'll be a mad dash to get to your potato crop in time to refill your cannon, and get the farmers before they can escape!</p>\n<p>MODIFIERS:</p>\n<p>As the days go by, the farmers will build walls to block you and your potatoes. \u00a0This will cause you to have to strategise even MORE in order to advance!</p>\n<p>The Achievements page will fill up with text telling you how many days you've completed, as a useful way to remember how far you've come!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T11:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14d9fff301e4fbb1c1c2267554b5aaa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Fancy Fairy Co."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
