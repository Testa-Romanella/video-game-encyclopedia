However, things quickly spiral out of control when everything starts to break.</p>\n<p>The game is about trying to keep up with a slew of things that are breaking as you try and fix them with progressively less time to do so.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Godot Wild Game Jam #37, which I'm both excited and nervous about! I\u00a0don't know how much fun the game is, but I sure hope anybody who plays it does have fun with it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since it's a jam game, it's unfinished in a few aspects, such as the menus, which have nothing done because I ran out of time. I\u00a0don't know if I'll do any work on it now, even after the jam. I\u00a0did love making it, though!
