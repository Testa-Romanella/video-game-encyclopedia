A world not unlike our own yet somewhat alien to us. <br/>Chesnakisnak is a short choose-your-own adventure game which takes place in New Estuary city, in an anachronistic 1939. <br/>You play as Artorious Manx, proprietor of Chesnakisnak, a bar/snack shop selling fried garlic bread to the people of New Estuary. <br/>Artorious returns home every day to read his mail on his brand new Calculator. How he responds to this mail changes Artorious' story- will he miss paying his rent or perhaps find that the flames of lust have been lit between him and a childhood friend?  <br/>Relax and take in the sights or listen to DJ Laytnyt spin the best tunes on NEFM, all night long. Play various mini-games and explore your apartment building or read news articles on your Calculator.  <br/><br/>The night is young still. <br/>New Estuary awaits. <br/>You're never alone.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T19:47:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b33/b335b1c13e190fbb9996823a2977e6a7.jpg", "website": "https://schirwindt.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Schirwindt"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Schirwindt"], "esrb_rating": null}
