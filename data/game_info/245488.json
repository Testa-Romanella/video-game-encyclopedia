But what is the story about?<br/><br/>In a nutshell, it is the story of a Colombian condor, Tonio, who is unlike his kinsmen in that he can\u2019t fly. Not just because he is very fat, but also because he is afraid of heights. For a bird, of course, that is quite a flaw. But our Tonio has a lot of virtues.<br/><br/>He is kind, always ready to come to the aid of a friend. He is a terrific cook and a hospitable host. And he would be leading a very quiet life were it not for a wolf who has long dreamed of tasting some roast Tonio. And now his Condor friends have decided to teach Tonio how to fly.
