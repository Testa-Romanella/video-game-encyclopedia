{"id": 956848, "slug": "bouncervr-alpha-test", "name": "BouncerVR [Alpha Test]", "name_original": "BouncerVR [Alpha Test]", "description": "<p>Introducing a new VR game that will take you back to your gym class days, where you will experience the excitement and fun of dodgeball in a virtual world! This dodgeball game is designed to be played exclusively in VR and will provide you with hours of entertainment and challenges.</p>\n<p>The game will feature various tutorials, including Dodge Training, Throw Training, and AI training, to help you master the skills required to win the game. There is no time limit for training, so you can practice as much as you want.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the single-player mode, you will be pitted against NPCs with varying levels of difficulty, in a 1v1 match. The game is designed to challenge your skills and test your reflexes in a dynamic and interactive environment.\r\n</p>\n<p>The multiplayer mode is planned for the future, which will allow players to compete with their friends or other players from around the world. However, no official date has been announced yet.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game also includes a free mode in the main menu, where you can throw the ball at an NPC that will dodge your throws. This is a great way to relax and have fun while testing your throwing skills.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please note that the game is still in development, and currently, only the Dodge Training tutorial is available. However, I'm\u00a0working hard to bring you the full game experience, and I\u00a0hope to release Beta soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T16:37:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/6185f93e908388bde6330a2c7f6ef843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lak1z"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
