On New Year's Eve, we cut it into pieces, naming each piece as we go, after people or ideals. Commonly starting with a piece named after god, the home, and members of the family, but there are many non-traditional variations. For example in my home we cut no piece for god, but do cut a piece for\u00a0feminism, , a piece for people in need, etc.<br/><br/>Each member of the family and/or friends gets the piece named after them, and when the pieces are consumed (or rummaged through), the coin is found. The coin is considered to bestow luck upon the finder for the whole year.<br/><br/>This app lets you choose the number of cake pieces, then name them, then chooses the piece with the hidden coin inside.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acd/acd5730d1e62798509f76921e4c50051.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["castpixel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
