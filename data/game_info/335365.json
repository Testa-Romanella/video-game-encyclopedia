And you can make an excursion into the past with the help of a forgotten toy &quot;Space Rebellion&quot; (&quot;Rebellious Polaris&quot;), released by Discovery. Moreover, in order to make this journey, the game does not need to be installed on the hard drive at all \u2013 it automatically loads directly from the CD. And again spaceships will plow the expanses of the Universe, suppressing uprisings in the colonies of the Vega system, and again the fragments of exploding bombs and the glare of fires will not let you sleep at night.</p>\n<p>Go to capture new planets in the company of Discovery!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-20T13:03:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d6d/d6d46d0de2bdcb62ff2f2609eda38dca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Prism Leisure"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Midas Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
