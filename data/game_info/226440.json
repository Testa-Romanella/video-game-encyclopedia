And would like to find himself at the helm of the Millennium Falcon or a Firefly.  Then the game for you. You are a new space trader, with a new ship and big bills to pay off, ships don't come cheap! You will explore new trade routes, trading<br/>goods, fighting pirates  and possibly getting rousted by the police. Hopefully while taking part in all of this adventure you'll earn enough Vectorium to make the monthly payments on the ship.<br/>P.S. It is a really HARD game, there no press X to win.  Only the coolest and lucky captains will reach victory. So good luck!<br/><br/>Creator of the board game Felbrigg Herriot.<br/><br/>2009 Golden Geek Best Print &amp; Play Board Game Nominee", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/678/6788b3c8288c6fd807ac65c65b678d84.jpg", "website": "http://bmcgames.com/free-trader/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Maxim Matyushenko", "Baby Marsupial Creations"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Baby Marsupial Creations"], "esrb_rating": null}
