You\u00a0must use her four elemental spells to navigate through chess board levels littered with enemies and obstacles.<br/><br/>Once you clear the main story (a rather short campaign), there are three bonus levels (\"kaizo levels\") with greater difficulty found in level select.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Creation:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>Witchess</em> was created by a small student team in the span of a month and a half. The initial project was actually inspired by Smash Bros, though we took the approach of \"finding the fun\" and letting the game \"design itself.\" We're amused to see how differently it turned out!<br/></p>\n<strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong>\n<p>Gustavo\u00a0D'Mello\u00a0(Developer, Game Design)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Noah Gilson (Developer, Art Direction, Mid/Late Game Level Design)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Shaoze Zhou (Developer, Sound Design)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yash Ramchandani\u00a0 (Developer, Marketing/Communications)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Connor Page (Enemy Movement)</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks:</strong></p>\n<p>Medium Difficulty Level Theme -\u00a0Albin Rickman</p>\n<p>Initial Application Icon -\u00a0Kashish Motwani</p>\n<p>Trailer VA -\u00a0Matthew Skrzycki</p>\n<p>In addition to the people listed here, the creation of our game was also made possible by wonderful strangers on the internet who uploaded their assets for free use.
