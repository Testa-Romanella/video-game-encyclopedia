I used free assets from Unity's 3D Game Kit and focused on:</p>\n<ul><li>Blockout of rooms with Probuilder, Unity's mesh/modeling tool</li><li>Platform placement, motion, and timing</li><li>Adapting the provided \"acid\" material &amp; shader for lava</li><li>Placing stonework models all over the blockout</li><li>Writing a small amount of code for the last platform series</li></ul>\n<p>My goal was to make the platform jumps difficult, but not impossible. The\u00a0level could take 5-20 minutes to complete depending on how many tries it takes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: If the player jumps and lands on the ground while still pressing forward, they perform a roll, sometimes unintentionally off a ledge or platform. To avoid this, release the forward button before landing.</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you liked the level or have any suggestions, feel free to leave a comment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:35:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d0/2d0a5aab59afa7bd7702c3a5e230b20a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicolas Ayllon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
