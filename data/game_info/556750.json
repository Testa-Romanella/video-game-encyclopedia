{"id": 556750, "slug": "cave-climber", "name": "Cave Climber", "name_original": "Cave Climber", "description": "A passionate spelunker by nature, Gary has gotten himself into some quite deep trouble.\r\n<p>The poor guy, reckless as he is, fell down a long shaft to a rather unpleasent meeting with the ground below.\u00a0 After regaining his senses, he has to wonder just how far he slumped down the enourmous cave complex.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And now you're tasked with helping him quickly find his way back up.\u00a0 But beware, that is quite the task. Fiendish creatures and crawlers lurk in the dark pathways, and fittingly seem to have nothing else to do than to pain the unfortunate cave dweller.\u00a0 Time too is of the essence, so Gary is forced to climb his way as quickly as his feet allow him, or else he's forced to bite the dust forever sealed below.</p>\n<p>Cave Climber is a fast paced arcade style platformer. It's gameplay encourages fast twitchy reaction based playstyles, as you'll won't get much time to hide away in your race against the strict timer. A succesfull playthrough should take you a little under a half hour, if you don't run out of likes before reaching the ground above.<br/></p>\n<p>The three\u00a0 \u00a0difficulty modes will help you getting through the game to your liking without changing up the level progression itself.</p>\n\r\n\r\nA little bit to playing and controlling Cave Climber.\r\n-\r\nThe program supports both keyboard input as well as Xbox 360 and\r\ncompatible controllers. Other third party controller admittedly\r\nwon't work without some workaround. Just a heads up :)\r\n-\r\nKeyboard uses Space/Esc/A/S/Arrow Keys as input.\r\n-\r\nEsc pauses the game or quits the game. Holding down Esc when\r\nthe game is paused quits the game.\r\nF3 toggles between Fullscreen/Window", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63c79b2e13e3c8861b34988dd8507997.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shajamaru"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
