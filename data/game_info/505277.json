You will go room after room trying to gather enough energy resources to have enough power to give conciousness to a computer, which will be your Mega Final Boss.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- WASD or Arrows to move<br/>- SPACE to interact with objects<br/>- Q to use switch from Particle to Wave form (and back)<br/>- R to restart the level<br/>- M to go back to the main menu<br/><br/>Live a touching experience with Dr. Grandpa, exiled from the world for the danger of his discoveries<br/></p>\n\n<p>Warnings:<br/>- The final level is a bit buggy.\u00a0I wish I had more time to spend on it, but that wasn't the case. Sometimes it might not detect a win or stuff like that. In that case you can press R to restart the level. Also, your opponend will play \"randomly\". It would be cool to have some kind of algorithm that makes it play better, but that would have meant a lot more time needed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T03:30:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/565/56585c4b1611279201eeaeaf87d11ffa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fran314"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
