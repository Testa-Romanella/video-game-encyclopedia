{"id": 507187, "slug": "time-hacker", "name": "Time Hacker", "name_original": "Time Hacker", "description": "<h3>An unlikely hero with an unusual power</h3><br/>In a laboratory where intelligent and powerful robots are under development, a failure suddenly occurs. This transforms the seemingly innocuous machines into bloodthirsty agents of evil. But you have a secret weapon: the ability to stop time momentarily. Use your precious seconds of frozen time to make small but critical changes, then, when the normal flow of time is restored, watch as the hilarious chaos unfolds.<h3>A god of manipulation</h3><br/>Take \u201cpossession\u201d of the robots, then manipulate them into annihilation. To ensure every last one of those evil machines is put to rest though, you\u2019ll also need to make clever changes to the scene.<h3>Create a glorious \u201cchain of destruction\u201d</h3><br/>Explore the immersive VR environment, then set up \u201cbooby traps\u201d that will lead to satisfying \u201cconclusions.\u201d Blow up flammable barrels and explosive cylinders. Break chains, rescue hostages, dodge shots, change the direction of cars and cranes, place dynamite, shockers, and more. Make sure you get all the robots though, because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be the one who ends up dead. <br/><br/><h3>Train a devious mind</h3><br/>Time Hacker currently features more than 40 exciting levels of varying difficulty. Go through the easy levels to build up your abilities and learn the basic controls. Gradually unlock more difficult levels as  you progress. To complete the most difficult levels, you\u2019ll need to carefully plot a sequence of glorious destruction. To do so, you\u2019ll need both mastery of the controls and sharp (and devious) mind.<h3>Sandbox Mode </h3><br/>Time Hacker also comes with \u201cSandbox Mode,\u201d where you can place bots, cars, explosives, and any other items at will. Here, the sky's the limit on your creative destruction. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T02:25:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d6/0d68cb64a3df5f95d267271fa26bcbea.jpg", "website": "https://timehacker.joyway.games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 467, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joy Way"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joy Way"], "esrb_rating": null}
