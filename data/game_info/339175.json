It is now up to the certain moderator yournamehere (/ck/) and his colleagues kinomod (/a/) and Aerolite to round up all the villains, as well as save the site from a threat greater than they could have ever anticipated.<br/></p>\n<p>This is easily one of the dumbest game ideas I've had, so I couldn't resist making it a reality. I always kinda disliked setting shmups in space, so this seemed like a nice different thing. Additionally, Touhou Hagurumaden was a Touhou fangame storywise, but I wanted to make a gameplay tribute too. And finally, I wanted a -hou series (though I doubt I will ever make a sequel).\u00a0 Thanks for trying it out (but please don't play the extra stage before clearing the main story, that's illegal)! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls for Windows/Web:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Movement - Arrow keys </li><li>Shoot/ Advance text/Select - A </li><li>Bomb / Skip Text - S </li><li>\u00a0Focus (move slower + see hitbox) - D </li><li>Skip warning screen - Enter</li><li>Full screen: CTRL + Enter for Windows / Button for Web</li><li>Open&amp;Close Pause Menu / Exit from title screen - Escape</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional not</strong><strong>es:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Original release date:\u00a007/02/19</li><li>This is a work of fiction.
