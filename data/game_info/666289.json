In non-combat mode you can run with Shift.\r\n</p>\n<p>3) You can attack with\u00a0<strong>left mouse button\u00a0</strong>and in combat mode you can switch between different types of sword strikes (4) by pressing\u00a0<strong>Q</strong>\u00a0 to shuffle through them or\u00a0<strong>1,2,3,4</strong>\u00a0keys to directly select them. Note that the attacks do not align perfectly with the shown paths because ( #1 they are working on upper body only and #2 they are blending with the idle animation )\r\n</p>\n<p>4) Attacks are actually physics based, so you can hit swords and shields and these will bounce the sword/arm. This doesn't mean that if you hit a sword or shield you wont get a strike, since a part of the sword might still hit something.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>5)\u00a0 The health bar on the left bottom of screen: if it runs out of red, you are dead. You can restart from options menu (\u00a0<strong>Escape</strong>\u00a0key)\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>6) You can also crouch (<strong>c</strong>) , jump (<strong>space-bar</strong>), \u00a0defend(<strong>x</strong>),\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some Info:</p>\n<p>I set out to build a semi realistic sword fighting in third person game for the jam. <br/></p>\n<p>I'm working on a bigger project that requires it and I hadn't gotten to it since I had mainly been working on art. I figured the jam is a good opportunity to push the project forward, so I grabbed some random character model I had bought on a whim/sale earlier and started hacking away. This character choice would then put me on a path of making the jam game in a classic looking fantasy setting. <br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0 mainly had\u00a0many\u00a0grand ides about\u00a0how the\u00a0sword\u00a0play should work and really not much of a story or anything else. There was supposed to be a good chunk of magic powers, but I cut it. I spent most of the jam making a nice Character Controller, I think it came out well. There are a bunch of bugs regardless. I also wasted a lot of time on making the character look nice and some physics things behave. Clearly there is a lot left to do to make this good/fun.<br/></p>\n<p>I'll probably port this work back into the bigger project, so I probably wont update this beyond the jam.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, sadly there is not much of a game, it mostly ended up being a mostly\u00a0empty sandbox island with a few little fights. I suggest you stay on the paths, there is no secret thing hiding on the island, if you can't find anything else to do, that's because I ran out of time and that is all there is to it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:56:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae5/ae5f480030039f11bdacf73431e42565.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["invadererik"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
