Use WASD to move around and mouse input to aim and shoot.</p>\n<p>In this game you play as a soldier who has to survive as long as possible while massive waves of zombies tries to kill you. Random powers will spawn around the map that you can pick up to get certain buffs for a short time. Every ten seconds, a new \"chaos event\" will occur which drastically changes how you play the game and makes it even more chaotic. The more zombies you kill, the higher score you get. This game also features a highscore system.</p><p>Environment and tile map made by:\u00a0https://angrysnail.itch.io/pixel-art-graveyard-tileset.</p><p>Music made by:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/driving-game-stylish-retro-beat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:01:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64c871f78b7efe00c41d9213bcd85f7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Agentt9990"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
