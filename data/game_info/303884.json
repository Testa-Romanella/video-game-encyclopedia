Chasing down the dregs of society, loitering in the shadier side of town, and doing so without causing a scene. She's an Aetherist, all of her \"spells\" are flashy!</p>\n<p>If that wasn't enough, her grandfather informed her that she's got an arranged marriage coming up with another spacer agent no less! It's <strong>1878</strong>, and her late parents couldn't have known about the <strong>Spacer Association</strong>. If they did, there is no way they could have approved of it. Then, as if to add insult to injury, the <strong>Spacer Association</strong> lost track of his whereabouts! All of this, and they called her into work on a Sunday to boot!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Port Phobos and the Aether Frigates</strong> takes place in an alternate history, one built out of the classic science fiction of the late 19'th century. A place that's an odd cross-breed of a Victorian society, Steam-Punk technology, and just a dash of the old west. Gunslingers, Aether-tech-mages, and Space Pirates collide in an adventure spanning the inner planets of the Solar System.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Venus</strong>: The jungle world, our celestial neighbor, looks like some kind of rain forest, but is that really all there is?\r\n</li>\n<li><strong>Neith</strong>: A moon of Venus, Neith is a world that was quickly settled by humanity during the first space war, and the home of steam-tech.\r\n</li>\n<li><strong>Mars</strong>: The infamous red-planet. With it's red grasslands and cat-people aliens; there is no wonder that it was the first place the Spacer Association placed an outpost.\r\n</li>\n<li><strong>Phobos</strong>: If Priscilla was asked, she'd say \"This place is just weird.\" A small moon with purple grass, flying pigs, and some kind of alien plant-life - this place is probably not terribly friendly to outsiders. Wait... Why is there a human settlement here?!!?</li></ul>\n\n<p>Again, I would like to remind everyone that Drifty from Driftwood Gaming needs your support due to cancer.
