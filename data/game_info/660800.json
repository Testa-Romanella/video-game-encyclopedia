I will report these changes on the Foxhole mod nexus discord hub. USING THIS MOD YOU MAY HAVE OCCASIONAL CRASHES, BUGS, OR OTHER ERRORS. USE THIS MOD AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION. I DID NOT MAKE THIS MESH OR THE TEXTURE. SOMEONE ELSE MADE THIS ASSET AND ALL I DID WAS PUT IT IN THE GAME. HERE IS THE LINK TO THE ORIGINAL. https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/campaign-hat-dark-brown-2d33cab42f4c4500bd183d02...</p>\n\n<p>If you're going to be shot, the vast majority of the time it's going to be in the torso. Your helmet is too heavy and holes have been shot through it, rusted over and welded shut too many times to make out. These rayon-fiber, water resistant felt campaign hats keep your head warm in the winter and are very stylish. While wearing it on the first day it was issued to you, you kept your head well below the wall of the trenches for fear of the watchful snipers. On the second, a warden ran from you at the sight of the hat's silhouette peeking from the bushes. By the third day you had ditched your rusty old can of a helmet in the pile with the others, another heap of scrap for future generations to pick through. <br/></p>\n<p>There will most likely not be a Warden version unless I get enough people asking for it. I am a Colonial loyalist and a Foxhole lore enthusiast. The Colonials are based heavily on American/British/Russian WW2 era technology while the Wardens are French/German/Italian. \u00a0For this reason, I don't think it would fit the atmosphere of the game for Wardens to be wearing campaign hats. As well, I don't much feel like creating content for the faction that I never play as, especially if I don't want to see it in game. If you want a warden version, just ask, and I'll do it. <br/><br/>Changelog 0.01</p>\n<p>fixed proportions, angle, scaling, and color<br/></p>\n<p>fixed bug with lercas marine skin causing leather band to display helmet texture<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T19:44:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acf771b34eabdbda7f9c6ad77d0687b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Puffy420blazeit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
