In this game, the player is put to the test against the best of the best. You will have to fight against the opposing military forces in order to over take enemy territory and to defend your base from incoming assaults. You will be challenged in 5 separate levels back to back. There isn't much of a story to be told, but when duty calls, you must enter a state of war. You will be taking orders from the president of the United States. You must survive in waves of attacks until the mission timer reaches zero. Simply point and click to shoot. You will go head to head against (humans, zombies, spiders, attack boats, snipers and robots). Good luck to anyone who takes a shot at this relaxing rail shooter.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T07:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa3e031fe4fa862a858c4e729e62547d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["YC Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
