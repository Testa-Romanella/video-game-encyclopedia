Meanwhile, resistance forces can automatically arise, holding off the conquest and wearing down the attacker.<h3>Replaying games</h3>Relive your favorite games and watch the rise of your empire, or learn from your defeats by studying how it all went wrong. You will also have the ability to continue any game from the state it was in at any point in its history.<h3>Multiplayer*</h3>Compete online against up to a hundred** players in a battle royale for world domination, as each player works to defend their interests and gain points to climb the leaderboard.<br/><br/>*Multiplayer games will depend on server status and may not always be available.<br/>**Number of players will depend on the flow of users joining the game at that time, in order to reduce waiting times as much as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-01T14:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2d/e2d31d37b5dc17b1d2235c31e6267a09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 327, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez Ferrero"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez Ferrero"], "esrb_rating": null}
