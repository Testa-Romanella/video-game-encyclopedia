You can collect coins and powerful power-ups along the way.</p>\n<p>But be careful: Gravity can reverse at any time and cause you to fall into the void. At the same time, as you progress, the pace of the game gets faster and the ball gets bigger. This will also make it heavier and the platforms will start spinning.</p>\n<p>Are you up to this challenge and can you set a new high score?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T11:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f7/2f709bdb23d59e8192d44c22e9f94c7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Angles Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
