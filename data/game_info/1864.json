A team of 8 worked on the original Carmageddon at Stainless, and 5 are still with the company today, although a couple of them are now kept manacled in a small padded room in the cellar.<br />\nStainless Games now employs well over fifty mad, dedicated people of assorted gender, height and width. They can all be found dangling precariously from a small chalky rock just off the South Coast of England.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "1997-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T13:31:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ca/6ca508f924da59e8cab1610b30117b56.jpeg", "website": "http://www.carmageddon.com/funsize/", "rating": 4.16, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 75, "beaten": 139, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 95, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 163, "suggestions_count": 374, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 166, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color", "iOS", "PC", "Android", "PlayStation", "Classic Macintosh", "Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Stainless Games", "Software Creations", "Stainless Software", "Aqua Pacific"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Interplay Productions", "Stainless Games", "Titus Software", "Sales Curve Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
