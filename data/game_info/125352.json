However, when robots lack <strong>Red Fluid</strong>, they change their character, become aggressive and begin to siphon Men from their blood. Thus, they put their research base in quarantine.<br/>You too are a robot that works thanks to the <strong>Red Fluid</strong>, explore the base and find an exit.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>NOTE:<br/></strong></em>This is just the first level of the game. Thanks to your feedbacks I could improve it and continue the development on a better basis. So do not hesitate to tell me what could be improved, something that bothers you, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>HOW TO PLAY:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>MOVEMENT: ARROW Keys</li><li>JUMPING: SPACE Key</li><li>FLASHLIGHT TOGGLE ON/OFF: F Key</li><li>INTERACTION: E key</li><li>ATTACKING (MELE): V Key (You must be close to the enemy)</li><li>LASER GUN (IF EQUIPPED): 1 key</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01df6868f4163dd235269d7bfc260724.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abdou Aziz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
