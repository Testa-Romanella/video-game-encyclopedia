{"id": 32975, "slug": "airxonix", "name": "AirXonix", "name_original": "AirXonix", "description": "A fast and fun arcade-style game. AirXonix is a modern 3-dimensional remake of the famous Xonix game. In the older Xonix you controlled a device, which moved over a field with several monster-balls wandering inside. The objective was to cut the balls away from as much spare field as possible. The rules of AirXonix are almost the same, except the device you control is flying in the air and everything is in full 3D! AirXonix includes 5 types of games with more then 80 levels.<br/><br/>GAME RULES: <br/>You control the flying device, which moves above the playing field. Your goal is to fill in the majority of the field. To achieve it, you have to fly above a clear area, and to cut off parts without the balls. (At the same time the balls should not cross your trajectory!) Avoid contacts with the mines, which move on the filled areas. Playing time for each level is limited. Collect the bonuses to gain life, to increase score and time, to slow down all balls and mines.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-16T14:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/6650820b85fefc79300560dd8d184218.jpg", "website": "http://www.axysoft.com/airxonix/", "rating": 4.43, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Axysoft", "Vladimir Savin"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Axysoft", "Vladimir Savin"], "esrb_rating": null}
