The NutshellEngine's graphics module used here is basically vulkan-raymarching with a few adjustments.</p>\n<p>Making a game using only raymarching and Signed Distance Fields is definitely something interesting for a gamejam.</p>\n<p><strong>The Origin of Light</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You play as a root coming from an evil mass that stole the light of the world.\r\n</p>\n<p>Denying your evil origins, you decide to give back the light to the world by destroying the dark spheres holding them captive.</p>\n<p>Everything visible on screen is a Signed Distance Field and is raymarched. If your GPU cannot handle the game at the native 1280x720 resolution, resizing the window will help a lot.</p>\n<p>WASD to move the roots.</p>\n<p>Move the mouse to move the camera.</p>\n<p>R to show/hide the mouse cursor.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T11:10:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/985/985e032c169a6eff812f5ef3a5f3e605.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZaOniRinku"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
