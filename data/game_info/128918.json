Combine the wide array of ingredients at your disposal to create dishes that wow and thrill your customers. This game was made at TOJam: Don't Stop bELEVEN in 2016.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTo play: your customers' orders will appear along the counter, including a display of their flavour preferences. Check the ingredients you have (by clicking them once) to see what flavour potential they have. Each ingredient's flavours will be unlocked by serving them in various ways (raw, chopped, boiled, etc). Under their flavour potential, each ingredient will display two ways to prepare it to access that potential; the first will unlock half the potential, the second will unlock the full potential.\r\n</p><p>\tOnce you've selected an ingredient, drag it to a working area to cook it. Different methods of cooking require different actions from you, so pay attention to ensure your ingredients are cooked as well as possible. \r\n</p><p>\tFinally, once you're satisfied that your ingredient is ready, put it on the plate under an order to get it ready to be served. You can add as many ingredients as you like to an order, and once you're happy with it, click the check mark on the order to serve it. The dish will automatically be served if time runs out, so make sure you manage your time well.\r\n</p><p>\tEach customer will leave a Quasar Rating for your restaurant after they're served. Your Quasar score determines how popular your restaurant is; without a good score, you'll never run a successful business. Keep your rating above 1 Goat, or your restaurant will have to close its doors.\r\n</p><p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p><p>Art: Britney Coates (@britney_coates)</p><p>Programming: Craig Thomas (@craig_thomas)</p><p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, hit us up on Twitter @TheAngrySquids, or shoot us an email at theangrysquids[at]gmail.com.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be543431d53fcea9f3e2a9754fc82028.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AngrySquidGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
