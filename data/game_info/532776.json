The maze is randomly generated and has multiple floors. The player must find the exit which is on the top of the maze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently, this is just a prototype demo, so the levels are premade and not randomly generated as you play. We plan to change that in a later version (but the algorithm needs to be optimized) to maximize replayability.</p>\n<p>This demo is made as our final project for the Unity/C# education of the \"PISMO\" incubator in Novska,\u00a0HR.
