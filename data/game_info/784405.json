You can see in screnshots all the views that are in the game with almost empty Chloe. Your work is to fill her to the brim. She would not gain anything, so if you are into weight gain, then this game is not for you. But instead you get 20 fullness stages and 4 belly stages (capacity in each is different).</p>\n<p>Warning! Read this before you buy!\r\n</p>\n<p>If you follow me, you should know, that for now I create multiple short games with some sort of game mechanics in almost standard interface. It is literally a bunch of images, that appear in different circumstances and there is almost no weight gain. All my games are stuffing games. And for me the main value is that they are different. Different models, morphs, clothes, different style of interactions. Every game is an experiment. They are as they are. Some people, such as me like such things and diversity. So if you are not into it, i ask you to understand and to forgive))\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T11:08:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/413/413c5c219bf19598e1fc27b4ec77ec81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yuliya3k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
