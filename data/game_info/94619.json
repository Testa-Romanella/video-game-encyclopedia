This isn't a full game, so not all of the features are implemented which I would have liked and there aren't very many maps. I've added a download link, aswell as a web player incase you use chrome or just prefer it in a standalone player :)</p><p>This is mainly to get people's feedback to see if they like it, or to give inspiration to another developer :)</p><p>The game was made in Unity and took just over a week, it was a good learning experience for me, so even if people don't enjoy it much, it was still worth it :D</p><p>Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the game. Please give me feedback on Twitter (or on this site if it's possible) :D</p><p>- Anthony</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7eed5ae543dac68a38737856dc978e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ansity Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
